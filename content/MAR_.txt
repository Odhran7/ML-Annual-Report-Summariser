 item 1 business 

corporate structure and business 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotel residential and timeshare properties under numerous brand names at different price and service points consistent with our focus on management franchising and licensing we own very few of our lodging properties 

the following table shows our portfolio of brands at yearend 2021 

we discuss our operations in the following two operating segments both of which meet the applicable accounting criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment us  canada and international see note 14 for more information 

covid19 

covid19 has had an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and the company and it will continue to have a material negative impact on our future results for a period of time that we are currently unable to predict for further information about covid19’s impact to our business see part i item 1a “risk factors” and part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

companyoperated properties 

at yearend 2021 we had 2007 companyoperated properties 568864 rooms which included properties under longterm management or lease agreements with property owners management and lease agreements together the “operating agreements” and properties that we own this does not include branded residential communities for which we manage the related owners’ association 

terms of our management agreements vary but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 15 to 30 years with options for us to renew for up to 10 or more additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a specified percentage of annual revenues that exceed a fixed amount many of our operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners many of our operating agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured those deficiencies in certain circumstances some of our management agreements allow owners to convert companyoperated properties to franchised properties under our brands 

for the lodging facilities we operate we generally are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs we provide centralized programs and services such as the loyalty program reservations and marketing as well as various accounting and data processing services and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs 

    

franchised and licensed properties 

we have franchising and licensing arrangements that permit hotel owners and operators to use many of our lodging brand names and systems under our hotel franchising arrangements we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees which typically range from four to seven percent of room revenues for all brands plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain fullservice brands franchisees contribute to our centralized programs and services such as the loyalty program reservations and marketing 

we also receive royalty fees under license agreements with marriott vacations worldwide corporation “mvw” our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011 and its affiliates for certain brands including marriott vacation club grand residences by marriott the ritzcarlton destination club westin sheraton and for certain existing properties st regis and the luxury collection we receive license fees from mvw consisting of a fixed annual fee adjusted for inflation plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes 

at yearend 2021 we had 5880 franchised and licensed properties 900437 rooms 

residential 

we use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate often in conjunction with hotel development and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others thirdparty owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk we have used or licensed the jw marriott the ritzcarlton ritzcarlton reserve w the luxury collection st regis edition bvlgari renaissance le méridien marriott sheraton westin four points delta hotels and autograph collection brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales at yearend 2021 we had 102 branded residential communities 9878 rooms 

intellectual property 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names trademarks service marks trade names and logos are very important to the development sales and marketing of our properties and services we believe that our brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality care service and value to our customers guests and the traveling public accordingly we register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise protect against its unauthorized use 

brand portfolio 

we believe that our brand portfolio offers the most compelling range of brands and hotels in hospitality our brands are categorized by style of offering  classic and distinctive our classic brands offer timehonored hospitality for the modern traveler and our distinctive brands offer memorable experiences with a unique perspective  each of which we group into three quality tiers luxury premium and select

3 we exclude geographical data for timeshare as its results are recorded within “unallocated corporate and other” 

loyalty and credit card programs 

marriott bonvoy tm is our customer loyalty program through which members have access to our diverse brand portfolio rich benefits and travel experiences we refer to marriott bonvoy throughout this report as our “loyalty program” 

our loyalty program rewards members with points toward free hotel stays access to travel experiences through our marriott bonvoy tours  activities program miles with participating airline programs and other benefits we believe that our loyalty program generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in each of 2021 and 2020 approximately 50 percent of our global room nights were booked by loyalty program members we strategically market to this large and growing guest base to generate revenue see the “loyalty program” caption in note 2 for more information 

we have multiyear agreements with jpmorgan chase and american express for our usissued cobrand credit cards associated with our loyalty program we also license credit card programs internationally including in japan canada the united kingdom united arab emirates south korea and mexico we generally earn fixed amounts that are payable at contract inception and variable amounts that are paid to us monthly over the term of the agreements primarily based on card usage and we believe that our cobrand credit cards contribute to the success of our loyalty program and reflect the quality and value of our portfolio of brands 

    

sales and marketing and reservation systems 

marriottcom our international websites and our mobile application allow for a seamless booking experience and easy enrollment in our loyalty program to book our exclusive member rates and participate in program benefits our look no further ® best rate guarantee ensures best rate integrity strengthening consumer confidence in our brand and giving guests access to the best rates when they book hotel rooms through our direct channels we also remain focused on growing engagement levels with millions of guests by interacting with them through a variety of channels including our mobile application and digital guest services – contactless checkin and checkout chat service requests mobile key and more – across our hotel portfolio our digital strategy continues to focus on growing direct engagement with our customers through more destination content for leisure travelers and improved search optimization as well as driving bookings to our direct channels which generally deliver more profitable business to hotels in our system compared to bookings made through intermediary channels through our direct channels we aim to create a simple and efficient digital shopping and booking experience while elevating our service through digitallyenabled guest services to generate superior guest satisfaction and enable more frictionless and memorable stays at our properties we are also expanding the languages with which we serve guests around the world on our digital channels 

at yearend 2021 we operated 20 hotel reservation centers seven in the us and 13 in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own two of the us facilities and either lease the others or share space with a companyoperated property our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize thirdparty agents where cost effective economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room 

we believe our global sales and revenue management organizations are a key competitive advantage due to our focus on optimizing our investment in people processes and systems our aboveproperty sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around how the customer wants to buy reducing duplication of efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts we also utilize innovative and sophisticated revenue management systems many of which are proprietary which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increasing efficiency and optimizing propertylevel revenue for hotels in our portfolio most of the hotels in our portfolio utilize webbased programs to effectively manage the rate setup and modification processes the use of these webbased programs provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor other lodging management companies are primarily private management firms but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels operate hotels on behalf of thirdparty owners and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria 

our direct digital channels also compete for guests with large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as expediacom pricelinecom bookingcom travelocitycom and orbitzcom and search engines such as google bing yahoo and baidu our hotels compete for guests with other hotels and online platforms including airbnb and vrbo that allow travelers to book shortterm rentals of homes and apartments as an alternative to hotel rooms we compete for guests in many areas including brand recognition and reputation location guest satisfaction room rates quality of service amenities quality of accommodations safety and security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points 

affiliation with a brand is common in the us lodging industry and we believe that our strong brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2021 approximately 72 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the owner pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system in the franchising business we face many competitors that have strong brands and guest appeal including hilton ihg hotels  resorts hyatt wyndham hotels  resorts accor choice hotels radisson hotels best western hotels  resorts and others 

outside the us branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development compared to the past we believe that chain affiliation will continue to become more attractive in many overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers decline international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the benefits of centralized reservation systems marketing programs and loyalty programs 

    

based on lodging industry data we have an approximately 16 percent share of the us hotel market and a four percent share of the hotel market outside the us based on number of rooms we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher revpar than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong guest preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems our loyalty program and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to guest preference across all our brands 

seasonality 

in general business at companyoperated and franchised properties fluctuates moderately with the seasons however covid19 has impacted and may continue to impact our typical seasonal patterns in addition business at some resort properties may be more seasonal depending on location 

human capital management 

marriott’s long history of service innovation and growth is built on a commitment to putting people first we are committed to investing in our associates with a focus on leadership development recognition compensation career opportunity and skills training 

at yearend 2021 marriott employed approximately 120000 associates at properties customer care centers and aboveproperty operations approximately 97000 of these associates are located in the us of which approximately 19000 belong to labor unions outside the us some of our associates are represented by trade unions works councils or employee associations these numbers do not include associates who are employed by our hotel owners but whose employment is managed by marriott which is common outside the us or hotel personnel employed by our franchisees or other management companies hired by our franchisees marriott manages approximately 205000 associates who are employed by hotel owners marriott encourages franchisees to develop responsible business practices for human capital management however franchisees and management companies hired by franchisees are responsible for establishing their own labor and employment practices 

the impact of covid19 on the hospitality industry and actions that we and others in the hospitality industry took in response to covid19 including implementing furloughs reduced work week schedules and voluntary transition programs and eliminating a significant number of aboveproperty and onproperty positions have adversely affected our ability to attract and retain associates as lodging demand recovers from the lows seen in the early months of the pandemic we have seen and continue to see industrywide labor shortages causing challenges in hiring or rehiring for certain positions primarily in certain highdemand us markets in response we have enhanced our recruitment and retention efforts and increased compensation where needed to maintain competitiveness 

we have taken and continue to take numerous steps to address the safety and wellbeing of our associates in light of covid19 for example at our us headquarters and aboveproperty locations we instituted a covid19 vaccination requirement for our us propertylevel associates we instituted a multipronged approach to encourage and support associate vaccination including financial incentives schedule flexibility and health education we also provided quarantine pay to allow eligible associates with covid19 paid time to recover in other geographies we took legally permissible steps dependent on the jurisdiction including instituting vaccination requirements and offering incentives and education in addition we continue to implement policies and protocols designed to help minimize the spread of covid19 at our hotels such as our enhanced rigorous cleaning procedures as well as safety guidelines from the us centers for disease control and prevention the world health organization and various local health departments 

we are focused on providing our associates with the tools resources and support they need to thrive – both personally and professionally we have comprehensive compensation and benefits packages designed to invest in our associates and enrich their physical mental and financial wellbeing our policies and practices are designed to support pay equity throughout an associate’s career salary history inquiries are prohibited during our hiring process and in the us pay equity audits are conducted periodically in addition marriott is focused on the health and wellbeing of not only our associates but of their families as well in the us we provide our associates with access to health care coverage worklife support benefits and other benefits that support families including paid time off paid parental leave and financial assistance to help with adoption fees we also offer comprehensive benefits programs for associates outside the us the terms of which vary based on the geographic market in addition we offer all associates free access to a digital tool designed to help with stress management and resiliency 

in addition to offering comprehensive compensation and benefits we place an emphasis on supporting associates through access to career growth opportunities through skills training programs professional development opportunities and other learning experiences we provide associates with a multitude of choices for career and personal growth associates have access 

    

to the digital learning zone which is focused on providing personalized learning paths our leadership performance acceleration program encourages managers and associates to have ongoing performance and development conversations throughout the year as well as periodic formal reviews to help associates develop career plans chart a course for achieving those plans and monitor progress annually we also conduct an associate engagement survey which gives all associates the opportunity to provide feedback about their work experience leaders prepare action plans in response to survey results which in turn fosters associate engagement enhances the employment experience and drives improvement in our company’s culture despite the impact of the pandemic on our industry marriott’s engagement survey scores continue to be bestinclass and demonstrate satisfaction with the marriott employment experience and pride in the company 

our companywide diversity equity and inclusion efforts include a range of initiatives and programs to support our goal to make all stakeholders – associates guests owners and suppliers – feel welcome and valued we have oversight and accountability measures in place to support our focus on diversity equity and inclusion the inclusion and social impact committee of our board of directors the “isi committee” helps drive accountability across the company established in 2003 the isi committee is chaired by a member of our board of directors and comprised of certain other members of the board and certain company senior leaders the isi committee assists the board in carrying out its commitment and responsibilities relating to marriott’s peoplefirst culture and the company’s efforts to foster associate wellbeing and inclusion in 2021 we advanced our objectives to diversify our leadership at the vice president level and above by 1 accelerating our efforts to achieve global gender parity in company leadership by 2023 which is two years earlier than our original goal and 2 establishing a new objective to increase the representation of people of color in executive positions in the us to 25 percent by 2025 

sustainability and social impact 

guided by our 2025 sustainability and social impact goals as well as the united nations sustainable development goals we are focused on creating a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business our sustainability and social impact platform serve 360 doing good in every direction is built around four focus areas nurture our world sustain responsible operations empower through opportunity and welcome all and advance human rights – each with targets to drive our efforts through 2025 these targets reflect our goals to 1 support the resiliency and sustainable development of the communities and environments where we do business 2 work to reduce our environmental impacts design and operate sustainable hotels and source responsibly while mitigating climaterelated risk 3 facilitate workplace readiness and access to opportunity in our business and 4 create a safe welcoming world including by working with organizations to educate and advocate on issues related to human rights throughout and beyond our business although our progress in some areas has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic we remain focused on advancing our sustainability and social impact goals and initiatives 

in september 2021 we submitted a letter to the science based targets initiative sbti committing to 1 set sciencebased emissions reduction targets across all scopes in line with 15°c emissions scenarios and 2 set a longterm sciencebased target to reach netzero value chain greenhouse gas ghg emissions by no later than 2050 in line with the criteria and recommendations of sbti we are currently preparing our submission to sbti for our nearterm targets and developing longerterm strategies to support those targets 

our sustainability strategy and initiatives are focused on a wide range of issues including designing resourceefficient hotels implementing technologies to track and reduce energy and water consumption increasing the use of renewable energy managing climate and waterrelated risks reducing waste and food waste supporting innovative ecosystem restoration initiatives and focusing on responsible and local sourcing 

in response to the pandemic our hotels continued to support their local communities in need by donating food supplies and volunteer hours we also deployed our marriott disaster relief fund to provide essential items such as food vouchers to marriott associates in need due to the impact of the pandemic also in 2021 to further our human rights efforts we launched an updated version of our human trafficking awareness training and made further progress toward our goal to train 100 percent of onproperty associates in human trafficking awareness by 2025 this year in collaboration with a leading antitrafficking organization we plan to make our updated training opensourced for free access to our industry and beyond as we currently do with the original training 

government regulations 

as a company with global operations we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and government policies in the us and in jurisdictions around the world some of the regulations that most affect us include those related to employment practices environment health and safety trade and economic sanctions competition antibribery and anticorruption cybersecurity data privacy data localization and the handling of personally identifiable information the offer and sale of franchises and liquor sales

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to various risks that make an investment in our securities risky the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations in addition these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forwardlooking statements contained in this report or in other company communications these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations 

risks relating to covid19 

covid19 has had a material detrimental impact on our business and financial results and such impact could continue and may worsen for an unknown period of time 

covid19 has been and continues to be a complex and evolving situation with governments public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending and businesses and individuals implementing at various times and to varying degrees restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread such as warnings restrictions and bans on travel transportation or inperson gatherings closures of or occupancy or other operating limitations on work facilities lodging facilities food and beverage establishments schools public buildings and businesses cancellation of events including sporting events conferences and meetings and quarantines and lockdowns covid19 has dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms and has negatively impacted in some cases is continuing to negatively impact and may in the future negatively impact our business operations and financial results including but not limited to as follows 

• reducing revenues at our managed and franchised hotels owned and leased hotels and properties in which we have an investment 

• impacting the ability of our managed and franchised hotels owned and leased hotels and properties in which we have an investment to meet expenses including payment of amounts owed to us 

• adversely affecting the value of our owned and leased properties or investments 

• affecting the ability or willingness of hotel owners and franchisees to service repay or refinance existing indebtedness or similar obligations including loans or guaranty advances we have made to or for them 

• making it more difficult for hotel owners and franchisees to obtain financing on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

• causing hotel construction and opening delays 

• decreasing the rate at which new projects enter our pipeline 

• causing a significant number of hotels to exit our system 

• requiring us to borrow or otherwise raise a significant amount of cash in order to preserve financial flexibility repay maturing debt and manage debt maturities 

• causing the terms of our borrowing to be more expensive or more restrictive and 

• adversely affecting our ability to attract and retain associates 

the extent to which covid19 impacts our business operations and financial results will depend on the factors described above and numerous other evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess including the continued duration and scope of covid19 the availability effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines and treatments covid19’s impact on global and regional economies and economic activity unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending covid19’s short and longerterm impact on the demand for travel including business transient and group business and levels of consumer confidence and the extent to which the recovery of travel and lodging demand is disrupted by new covid19 variants or other dislocations in pandemic recovery covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from covid19 as well as additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic or future pandemics could also give rise to aggravate and impact our ability to allocate resources to mitigate the other risks that we identify below which in turn could materially adversely affect our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations further covid19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations 

    

risks relating to our industry 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully for guests  we operate in markets that contain many competitors each of our hotel brands and our home rental offering competes with major hotel chains regional hotel chains independent hotels and home sharing and rental services across national and international venues our ability to remain competitive and attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of and driving preference for our lodging products and services including our loyalty program direct booking channels consumerfacing technology platforms and services and other offerings including our cobranded credit cards from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline further new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to maintain or increase room rates or occupancy in those markets 

economic downturns and other global national and regional conditions could further impact our financial results and growth  because we conduct our business on a global platform changes in global national or regional economies governmental policies including in areas such as trade travel immigration healthcare and related issues and geopolitical and social conditions impact our activities our business is impacted by decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions changes in energy prices and currency values technologies that provide alternatives to inperson meetings and events political instability geopolitical conflict heightened travel security measures travel advisories disruptions in air travel and concerns over disease violence war or terrorism 

as discussed in “risks relating to covid19” our performance has been materially affected by some of these conditions and could be further materially affected if these conditions worsen arise in the future or extend longer than anticipated or in other circumstances that we are not able to predict or mitigate even after covid19 subsides our business markets growth prospects and business model could continue to be materially impacted or altered 

risks relating to our business 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance  our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee the failure of the hotel owner or franchisee to comply with its payment or other obligations under the agreement a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria which we do not cure or in certain limited cases other negotiated contractual termination rights some courts have also applied agency law principles and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have interpreted hotel management agreements to be “personal services contracts” property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future when terminations occur for certain of these or other reasons we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses we may have difficulty collecting damages from the hotel owner or franchisee and any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management or franchise agreement a significant loss of these agreements could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in arbitration or litigation or delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product service or systems initiatives the timing and amount of capital investments and reimbursement for operating costs system costs or other amounts in the months following the onset of the covid19 pandemic we saw an increase in such disagreements and an increase in disagreements may become more likely again in the future during other periods when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements and to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners franchisees and real estate investment partners but we cannot always do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in arbitration or litigation and could do so in the future if any such dispute resolution process results in an adverse outcome we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom pricelinecom 

    

bookingcom travelocitycom and orbitzcom as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although our best rate guarantee and member rate programs have helped limit guest preference shift to intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract guests including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google bing yahoo and baidu to steer guests toward their websites our business and profitability could be harmed to the extent that online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from our direct online channels or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels in addition if we are not able to negotiate new agreements on satisfactory terms when our existing contracts with intermediaries which generally have 2 to 3 year terms come up for renewal our business and prospects could be negatively impacted in a number of ways for example if newly negotiated agreements are on terms less favorable to our hotels than the expiring agreements or if we are not able to negotiate new agreements and our hotels no longer appear on intermediary websites our bookings could decline our profits and the operating profits of hotels in our system could decline and customers and owners may be less attracted to our brands we may not be able to recapture or offset any such loss of business through actions we take to enhance our direct marketing and reservation channels or to rely on other channels or other intermediary websites 

our growth strategy depends upon attracting thirdparty owners and franchisees to our platform and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable to us depending on the terms offered by our competitors  our growth strategy for adding lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements and franchise agreements for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs reduce our profits or limit our growth we and the hotels that we franchise or manage are subject to a variety of laws and regulations around the globe including among others laws related to employment practices marketing and advertising efforts trade and economic sanctions antibribery and anticorruption cybersecurity data privacy data localization and the handling of personally identifiable information competition the environment health and safety liquor sales and the offer and sale of franchises the compliance programs internal controls and policies we maintain and enforce to promote compliance with laws and regulations may not prevent our associates contractors or agents from materially violating these laws and regulations the failure to meet the requirements of applicable laws or regulations or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or reputation 

the significance of our operations outside of the us makes us susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation  a significant number of rooms in our system are located outside of the us and its territories which exposes us to certain challenges and risks many of which are outside of our control and which could materially reduce our revenues or profits materially increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions significantly disrupt our business or significantly damage our reputation these challenges and risks include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and government policies including sanctions that could have a material negative impact on our operations or our ability to pursue development opportunities cause reputational damage or otherwise affect us 2 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 3 uncertainties regarding the interpretation of local laws and the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws and 4 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism war pandemics or other health emergencies border control measures or other travel restrictions or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results  we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us accordingly fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues we are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our nonus business are generally reported in local currency which we then translate to us dollars for inclusion in our financial statements as a result exchange rate changes between foreign currencies and the us dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results to the extent that our international operations continue to grow our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow we enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to mitigate exposure to some of the foreign currency fluctuations but these efforts may not be successful these hedging agreements also do not cover all currencies in which we do business do not eliminate foreign 

    

currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our company and our brands and any deterioration could adversely impact our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations  many factors can affect the reputation and value of our company or one or more of our properties or brands including our ability to protect and use our brands and trademarks our hotels’ adherence to service and other brand standards our approach to or incidents involving matters related to food quality and safety guest and associate safety health and cleanliness managing and reducing our carbon footprint and our use of scarce natural resources supply chain management and diversity human rights and support for local communities and our compliance with applicable laws reputational value is also based on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us our brands and our hotels and it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations proceedings or penalties or litigation negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including lost sales boycotts reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program loss of development opportunities adverse government attention or associate retention and recruiting difficulties any material decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our brands or corporate image could affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

actions by our franchisees and licensees or others could adversely affect our image and reputation  we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties for lodging timeshare and residential properties and with respect to our credit card programs under the terms of their agreements with us these third parties interact directly with guests and others under our brand and trade names if these third parties fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems including any data or privacy incident or a circumstance involving guest or associate health or safety or project a brand image inconsistent with ours then our image and reputation could suffer although our agreements with these parties provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances it could be expensive or timeconsuming for us to pursue such remedies and even if we are successful in pursuing such remedies that may not be sufficient to mitigate reputational harm to us we also cannot assure you that in every instance a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights or that we could collect any awarded damages from the defaulting party 

collective bargaining activity and strikes could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs and interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies  a significant number of associates at our managed leased and owned hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements if relationships with our organized associates or the unions that represent them become adverse then the properties we operate could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations numerous collective bargaining agreements are typically subject to negotiation each year and our ability in the past to resolve such negotiations does not mean that we will be able to resolve future negotiations without strikes disruptions or on terms that we consider reasonable labor disputes and disruptions have in the past and could in the future result in adverse publicity or regulatory investigations and adversely affect operations and revenues at affected hotels in addition labor disputes and disruptions or increased demands from labor unions could harm our relationship with our associates result in increased regulatory requirements or inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities harm our relationships with our guests and customers divert management attention and reduce customer demand for our services all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses and legal costs and could impose limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by the operators of our franchised properties increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

our business could suffer if we cannot attract and retain associates or as the result of the loss of the services of our senior executives  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for personnel we have experienced challenges hiring for certain positions due to various factors such as increasing wage expectations and competition for labor from other industries and these circumstances could continue or worsen in the future to an extent and for durations that we are not able to predict if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of associates we could experience significant negative impacts on our operations associate morale and turnover guest satisfaction or our internal control environment insufficient numbers of associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses labor 

    

shortages have resulted and could continue to result in higher wages and initial hiring costs increasing our labor costs and labor costs at our hotels which could reduce our revenues and profits in addition the efforts and abilities of our senior executives are important elements of maintaining our competitive position and driving future growth and the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives could result in challenges executing our business strategies or other adverse effects on our business the impact of covid19 on the hospitality industry and actions that we and others in the hospitality industry have taken and may take in the future with respect to our associates and executives in response to covid19 have adversely affected and may in the future continue to adversely affect our ability to attract and retain associates and executives 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious diseases violence or war have reduced the demand for lodging which has adversely affected our revenues  we have seen a decline in travel and reduced demand for lodging due to socalled “acts of god” such as severe storms hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods volcanic activity wildfires and other natural disasters as well as manmade disasters and the spread of contagious diseases in locations where we own manage or franchise properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of guests and these circumstances could continue or worsen in the future to an extent and for durations that we are not able to predict actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest civil or geopolitical strife and other acts of violence could have a similar effect as with the effects we have already experienced from the covid19 pandemic any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for lodging limit the room rates that can be charged affect our growth andor increase our operating costs all of which could adversely affect our profits if a terrorist event or other incident of violence were to involve one or more of our branded properties demand for our properties in particular could suffer disproportionately which could further hurt our revenues and profits 

climate change and sustainability related concerns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we are subject to the risks associated with the physical effects of climate change including changes in sea levels water shortages droughts and the natural disasters discussed in the preceding paragraph and with changes in laws and regulations related to climate change and sustainability compliance with future climaterelated legislation and regulation and our efforts to achieve sciencebased emissions reduction targets could be difficult and costly consumer travel preferences may also shift due to sustainability related concerns or costs as a result of the foregoing we may experience significant increased operating and compliance costs operating disruptions or limitations reduced demand constraints on our growth and physical damage to our hotels all of which could adversely affect our profits 

insurance may not cover damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise or other aspects of our business and the cost of such insurance could increase  we require comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed leased and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary we also require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we our hotel owners or our franchisees can obtain or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods terrorist acts pandemics or liabilities that result from incidents involving the security of information systems may result in high deductibles low limits or may be uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance may be unacceptably high as a result we our hotel owners and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels or may not be successful in obtaining insurance at all for example over the past several years following the severe and widespread damage caused by natural disasters coupled with continued large global losses the property liability and other insurance markets have seen significant cost increases also due to the data security incident involving unauthorized access to the starwood reservations database which we initially reported in november 2018 the “data security incident” and the state of the cyber insurance market generally the costs for our cyber insurance increased with each of our renewals over the last several years and the cost of such insurance could continue to increase for future policy periods further in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we our hotel owners or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result our revenues and profits could be adversely affected and for properties we own or lease we could lose some or all of the capital that we have invested in the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations 

if our brands goodwill  or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record significant noncash charges to earnings  as of december 31 2021 we had 180 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred estimated fair values of our brands or reporting units could change if for example there are changes in the business climate unanticipated changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in guests’ perception and the reputation of our brands or changes in interest rates operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations 

    

development and financing risks 

our hotel owners and franchisees depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and they may be unable to access capital when necessary  current and potential hotel owners and franchisees must periodically spend money to fund new hotel investments as well as to refurbish and improve existing hotels the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners and franchisees depends in large measure on their ability to access the capital markets over which we have little control obtaining financing on attractive terms has been and may in the future be further constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing availability planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy and rate changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction demand for and availability of construction resources and other disruptive conditions in global regional or local markets 

our renovation activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we occasionally acquire and renovate hotel properties both directly and through partnerships and other business structures with third parties this presents a number of risks including that 1 weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we partner to raise capital for completion of projects 2 properties that we renovate could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or time we anticipate or we may be required to record additional impairment charges and 3 construction delays or cost overruns including those due to general market conditions shortages or increased costs of skilled labor andor materials lender financial defaults or socalled “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase project costs we could face similar risks to the extent we undertake development activities again in the future 

our owned properties and other real estate investments subject us to numerous risks  we have a number of owned and leased properties which are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property we may seek to sell some of these properties over time however equity real estate investments can be difficult to sell quickly and covid19 has disrupted the transaction markets for some hospitality assets we may not be able to complete asset sales at prices we find acceptable or at all moreover the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated if any by the related properties and the expenses incurred a variety of other factors also affect income from properties and real estate values including local market conditions and new supply of hotels availability and costs of staffing governmental regulations insurance zoning tax and eminent domain laws interest rate levels and the availability of financing our real estate properties have been and could in the future be impacted by any of these factors resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition if our properties continue to not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses including needed capital expenditures our income could be further adversely affected and we could be required to record additional significant noncash impairment charges to our results of operations 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  we participate through licensing agreements in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under many of our luxury and premium brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including risks that 1 changes in residential real estate demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future project developers of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or the tax benefits of mortgage financing or residential ownership generally or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims or claims related to purchaser deposits and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

more hotel projects in our development pipeline may be cancelled or delayed in opening which could adversely affect our growth prospects  we report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline including hotels under construction hotels subject to signed contracts and hotels approved for development but not yet under contract the eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and in particular the approved hotels that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including the risks described above in the risk factors entitled “our ability to grow our management and franchise systems 

    

is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments” and “covid19 has had a material detrimental impact on our business and financial results and such impact could continue and may worsen for an unknown period of time” we have seen construction timelines for pipeline hotels lengthen due to various factors including competition for skilled construction labor challenges related to financing disruption in the supply chain for materials and the impact of covid19 generally and these circumstances could continue or worsen in the future accordingly we cannot assure you that all of our development pipeline will result in new hotels entering our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties impact our profits  at times we make loans for hotel development acquisition or renovation expenditures when we enter into or amend management or franchise agreements from time to time we also provide thirdparty lenders with financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings we have suffered losses and could suffer losses in the future when hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded 

if owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed  the owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced if those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all the lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and foreclose on the property or the owners could declare bankruptcy as we have seen in the past and could see in the future such foreclosures or bankruptcies have in the past and could in the future in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows which could have a significant negative effect on our results of operations 

changes affecting the availability of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may have consequences that we cannot yet fully predict  we are a party to various agreements such as our multicurrency revolving credit agreement as amended the “credit facility” and other instruments where obligations by or to us are calculated based on or otherwise dependent on libor many of which have not yet replaced libor with an alternative benchmark rate effective january 1 2022 the one week and two month usd libor tenors and all tenors for eur chf jpy and gbp libor are no longer being published and all other usd libor tenors will cease to be published after june 30 2023 at this time it is difficult for us to predict the full effect of any changes from libor to an alternative benchmark rate upon or prior to the final libor cessation date the phase out of libor generally or the establishment and use of particular alternative benchmark rates to replace libor there continues to be uncertainty about how we the financial markets applicable law and the courts will address the replacement of libor with alternative benchmark rates for contracts that do not include fallback provisions to provide for such alternative benchmark rates in addition any changes from libor to an alternative benchmark rate may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds our receipts or payments under agreements that reference libor and the valuation of derivative or other contracts to which we are a party any of which could impact our results of operations and cash flows 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

any disruption in the functioning of our reservation systems could adversely affect our performance and results  we manage global reservation systems or use thirdparty service providers’ reservation systems that communicate reservations to our properties from individuals who book reservations directly with us online through our mobile apps through our telephone call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed accuracy and efficiency of our reservation systems are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands our business may suffer if we fail to maintain upgrade or prevent disruption to our reservation systems disruptions in or changes to our reservation systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management property management human resources and payroll systems our loyalty program and technologies we make available to our guests and for our associates these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and our business could suffer if we cannot do that as quickly or effectively as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower guest satisfaction or could impair our operating results 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of company associate and guest data  in the operation of our business we collect store use and transmit large volumes of data regarding associates guests customers owners licensees franchisees and our own business operations including credit card numbers reservation 

    

and loyalty data and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in systems maintained by third parties including our owners franchisees licensees and service providers the integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business our guests and associates also have a high expectation that we as well as our owners franchisees licensees and service providers will adequately protect and appropriately use their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by global laws and governmental regulation our contractual obligations and the requirements of the payment card industry continue to become increasingly stringent in many jurisdictions in which we operate our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners franchisees licensees and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing legal and regulatory requirements and associate and guest expectations or may require significant additional investments or time to do so we have incurred and may in the future incur significant additional costs to meet these requirements obligations and expectations and in the event of alleged or actual noncompliance we may experience increased operating costs increased exposure to fines and litigation and increased risk of damage to our reputation and brand 

the data security incident and other information security incidents could have numerous adverse effects on our business  as a result of the data security incident numerous lawsuits were filed against us as described further in note 7  we may be named as a party in additional lawsuits and other claims may be asserted by or on behalf of guests customers hotel owners stockholders or others seeking monetary damages or other relief related to the data security incident a number of federal state and foreign governmental authorities have also made inquiries opened investigations or requested information andor documents related to the data security incident including under various data protection and privacy regulations responding to and resolving these lawsuits claims andor investigations has resulted in fines and other expenses such as the £184 million fine imposed by the information commissioner’s office in the united kingdom the “ico” in connection with the ico’s final decision issued in october 2020 and could result in material additional fines or remedial or other expenses other governmental authorities investigating or seeking information about the data security incident may impose undertakings injunctive relief consent decrees or other civil or criminal penalties which could among other things materially increase our costs or otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business significant management time and company resources have been and will continue to be devoted to the data security incident future publicity or developments related to the data security incident including as a result of subsequent reports or regulatory actions or developments could have a range of other adverse effects on our business or prospects including causing or contributing to loss of consumer confidence reduced consumer demand reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program and associate retention and recruiting difficulties insurance coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data security incident may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses including the final fine imposed by the ico and any other fines or penalties related to the data security incident and certain expenses by their nature such as for example expenses related to enhancing our cybersecurity program are not covered by our insurance program in addition following our march 31 2020 announcement of an incident involving information for approximately 55 million guests that we believe may have been improperly accessed through an application using the login credentials of two franchise employees at a franchise property the “unauthorized application access incident” various governmental authorities opened investigations or requested information about the incident and two lawsuits were filed against us related to the incident which have since been dismissed or otherwise resolved the unauthorized application access incident or publicity related to it could negatively affect our business or reputation 

additional cybersecurity incidents could have adverse effects on our business  we have implemented enhanced security measures to safeguard our systems and data and we intend to continue implementing additional measures in the future but as we have seen in the past our measures may not be sufficient to maintain the confidentiality security or availability of the data we collect store and use to operate our business measures taken by our service providers or our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or their service providers also as we have seen in the past may not be sufficient efforts to hack or circumvent security measures efforts to gain unauthorized access to exploit or disrupt the operation or integrity of our data or systems failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses “ransomware” or other malware “supply chain” attacks “phishing” or other types of business communications compromises operator error or inadvertent releases of data have impacted and may in the future impact our information systems and records or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by third parties to gain unauthorized access or prevent authorized access to such systems have greatly increased in recent years our increased reliance on cloudbased services and on remote access to information systems in response to covid19 increases the company’s exposure to potential cybersecurity incidents we have experienced cyberattacks attempts to disrupt access to our systems and data and attempts to affect the operation or integrity of our data or systems and the frequency and sophistication of such efforts could continue to increase any additional significant theft of unauthorized access to compromise or loss of loss of access to or fraudulent use of guest associate owner franchisee licensee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in legal regulatory and other consequences including remedial and other expenses fines or litigation depending on the nature and scope of the event future compromises in the security of our information systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers or other future disruptions or compromises of data or systems could lead 

    

to future interruptions in or other adverse effects on the operation of our systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits and could result in negative publicity and other adverse effects on our business including lost sales loss of consumer confidence boycotts reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program litigation or associate satisfaction retention and recruiting difficulties all of which could materially affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

because we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past additional incidents or the failure to detect and appropriately respond to additional incidents could magnify the severity of the adverse effects on our business the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage information systems change frequently can be difficult to detect for long periods of time and can involve difficult or prolonged assessment or remediation periods even once detected which could also magnify the severity of these adverse effects we cannot assure you that all potential causes of past significant incidents have been identified and remediated additional measures may be needed to prevent significant incidents in the future the steps we take may not be sufficient to prevent future significant incidents and as a result such incidents may occur again although we carry cyber insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks that insurance coverage may not be sufficient or available to cover all expenses or other losses including fines or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyberattacks security compromises and other related incidents furthermore in the future such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

changes in privacy and data security laws could increase our operating costs and increase our exposure to fines and litigation  we are subject to numerous complex and frequently changing laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information nonus data privacy and data security laws various us federal and state laws payment card industry security standards and other information privacy and security standards are all applicable to us significant legislative judicial or regulatory changes have been and could be issued in the future compliance with changes in applicable data security and privacy laws and regulations and contractual obligations including responding to investigations into our compliance has increased and may in the future increase our operating costs and may restrict our business operations increase our exposure to fines and litigation in the event of alleged noncompliance and adversely affect our reputation following the data security incident certain regulators also opened investigations into our privacy and security policies and practices as a result of these investigations we could be exposed to significant fines and remediation costs in addition to those imposed as a result of the data security incident and adverse publicity related to the investigations could adversely affect our reputation 

changes in laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the proposed eprivacy regulation eu and the proposed bill c11 for the digital charter implementation act 2020 canada various us state laws or new federal or state laws on marketing and solicitation or international privacy eprivacy and antispam laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential guests and customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were to be prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new guests and customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

governance risk 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of directors’ consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder rights plan

business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotel residential and timeshare properties in 139 countries and territories under 30 brand names under our assetlight business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them we discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments us  canada and international 

we earn base management fees and under many agreements incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us in most markets base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue or certain propertylevel revenue in the case of franchise fees while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return for our hotels in the middle east and africa asia pacific excluding china and greater china regions incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit also referred to as “house profit” less noncontrollable expenses such as property insurance real estate taxes and furniture fixtures and equipment ffe reserves additionally we earn franchise fees for use of our intellectual property including fees from our cobrand credit card timeshare and residential programs 

on september 23 2016 we completed the acquisition of starwood hotels  resorts worldwide llc formerly known as starwood hotels  resorts worldwide inc “starwood” through a series of transactions after which starwood became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of the company we refer to the starwood business and brands that we acquired as “legacystarwood” 

performance measures 

we believe revenue per available room “revpar” which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which are components of calculating revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available including rooms in hotels temporarily closed due to issues related to covid19 measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels comparisons to prior periods are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we define our comparable properties as our properties that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year since january 1 2020 for the current period and have not in either the current or previous year 1 undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions 2 been converted between companyoperated and franchised or 3 sustained substantial property damage or business interruption with the exception of properties closed or otherwise experiencing interruptions related to covid19 which we continue to classify as comparable for 2021 compared to 2020 we had 4906 comparable us  canada properties and 1510 comparable international properties the revpar adr and occupancy comparisons between 2021 and 2019 which we discuss under the “impact of covid19” caption below reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of december 31 2021 even if in 2019 they were not open and operating for the full year or did not meet all the other criteria listed above 

impact of covid19 

covid19 continues to have a material impact on our business and industry however the recovery of both global demand and adr continued in 2021 led primarily by robust leisure demand which we expect to continue in 2022 and travelers who continue to embrace multipurpose trips mixing remote work and vacation time the spread of covid19 variants such as delta and omicron constrained the pace of the recovery in the latter half of 2021 and continues to constrain the pace of recovery in the beginning of 2022 business transient and group demand continued to slowly improve in 2021 when 

    

compared to 2020 though this demand still remains meaningfully below prepandemic 2019 levels although we have seen delays in the recovery of business transient and group demand as a result of the emergence of covid19 variants we expect this demand to gradually strengthen from current levels as more workers return to the office and travel again we have been encouraged by the swift improvement in adr which in the 2021 second half returned to prepandemic 2019 levels in certain us and international markets and are optimistic about sustaining strong adr in 2022 however we believe covid19 will continue to have a material negative impact on our future results for a period of time that we are currently unable to predict 

comparable systemwide constant dollar revpar in 2021 compared to 2020 improved 677 percent in our us  canada segment 406 percent in our international segment and 604 percent worldwide comparable systemwide constant dollar revpar in 2021 compared to prepandemic 2019 levels declined 325 percent in our us  canada segment 466 percent in our international segment and 365 percent worldwide with improvement in the decline each succeeding quarter during 2021 for each of our segments and worldwide worldwide comparable systemwide occupancy and constant dollar adr were down only 119 percentage points and 23 percent respectively in the 2021 fourth quarter compared to the 2019 fourth quarter leading to revpar 190 percent below prepandemic 2019 levels 

in the us  canada demand continued to recover in 2021 driven by strong leisure demand particularly at our luxury and resort hotels and in tertiary markets occupancy peaked in the 2021 third quarter before decreasing slightly in the 2021 fourth quarter primarily due to seasonality urban destinations where we have a large presence in the us  canada experienced meaningful improvement in demand in 2021 though they continue to lag the recovery in other parts of the world revpar continues to vary greatly by geographic market and demand is heavily impacted by the number of covid19 cases vaccination rates and the nature and degree of government restrictions in the 2021 fourth quarter the decline of comparable systemwide constant dollar revpar when compared to prepandemic 2019 levels improved compared to the decline seen in the 2021 third quarter in all our international regions except for greater china which remained flat as a result of strict government restrictions in response to covid19 outbreaks in several regions 

we continue to take measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts of covid19 for our hotel owners and our own business at the corporate level we remain focused on managing our corporate general and administrative costs and are being disciplined with respect to our capital expenditures and other investment spending share repurchases and cash dividends remain suspended until our leverage ratios further improve although assuming there is no meaningful setback in the global recovery from covid19 we could restart some level of capital returns in the second half of 2022 and more meaningful levels of capital returns in 2023 and beyond in 2021 we substantially completed restructuring plans to achieve cost savings specific to our companyoperated properties in addition we continue to work with owners and franchisees by adjusting renovation requirements for certain properties deferring certain hotel initiatives and supporting owners and franchisees who are working with their lenders to utilize ffe reserves to meet working capital needs 

we continue to evaluate the availability of stimulus tax credits under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the taxpayer certainty and disaster tax relief act of 2020 enacted as part of the consolidated appropriations act 2021 the american rescue plan act of 2021 “arpa” and other legislation as of february 1 2022 we have received employee retention tax credit “ertc” refunds from the us treasury totaling 170 million including 119 million in 2020 and 51 million in 2021 of which we passed through 94 million and 48 million respectively to the related hotels that we manage on behalf of owners we have received from the us treasury substantially all expected ertc refunds based on applications that we have submitted as of february 1 2022 additionally as of december 31 2021 we have received or expect to receive through medicare tax offsets and payments from the us treasury pursuant to arpa a total of 35 million as reimbursement for the cost of health coverage continuation provided to eligible former associates and furloughed or parttime associates and their eligible enrolled dependents in accordance with requirements under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 for the period of april 1 2021 to september 30 2021 finally in 2021 we received subsidies totaling 28 million from german government covid19 assistance programs for certain of our leased hotels and equity method investments in germany 

the impact of covid19 on the company remains fluid as does our corporate and propertylevel response we expect to continue to assess the situation and may implement additional measures to adapt our operations and plans to address the implications of covid19 on our business the overall operational and financial impact is highly dependent on the breadth and duration of covid19 and could be affected by other factors we are not currently able to predict 

starwood data security incident 

on november 30 2018 we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the starwood reservations database the “data security incident” the starwood reservations database is no longer used for busi ness operations 

    

we are currently unable to estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the company from the data security incident in excess of the expenses already incurred however we do not believe this incident will impact our longterm financial health although our insurance program includes coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data security incident that insurance may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses including fines and penalties related to the data security incident in addition certain expenses by their nature such as for example expenses related to enhancing our cybersecurity program are not covered by our insurance program we expect to incur significant expenses associated with the data security incident in future periods primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations including possible additional fines and penalties increased expenses and capital investments for information technology and information security and data privacy and increased expenses for compliance activities and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements see note 7 for additional information related to expenses incurred in 2021 insurance recoveries and legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the data security incident 

system growth and pipeline 

in 2021 our system grew from 7642 properties 1423044 rooms at yearend 2020 to 7989 properties 1479179 rooms at yearend 2021 reflecting gross additions of 517 properties 86372 rooms and deletions of 171 properties 30236 rooms including 88 properties from a primarily selectservice portfolio which left our system in the 2021 first quarter approximately 50 percent of our 2021 gross room additions are located outside us  canada and 21 percent were conversions from competitor brands

consolidated results 

our results in 2021 continued to be impacted by covid19 see the “impact of covid19” section above for more information about the impact to our business during 2021 and the discussion below for additional analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 

fee revenues 



the increase in base management fees primarily reflected higher revpar due to the ongoing recovery in lodging demand from the impacts of covid19 

the increase in franchise fees primarily reflected higher revpar due to the ongoing recovery in lodging demand from the impacts of covid19 higher cobrand credit card fees 102 million unit growth 89 million and higher residential branding fees 39 million 

the increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher profits at certain managed hotels due to the ongoing recovery in lodging demand from the impacts of covid19 in 2021 we earned incentive management fees from 47 percent of our managed properties worldwide compared to 37 percent in 2020 we earned incentive management fees from 13 percent of our us  canada managed properties and 63 percent of our international managed properties in 2021 compared to 3 percent in us  canada and 56 percent in international in 2020 in addition 71 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2021 came from our international managed properties versus 92 percent in 2020 

    

contract investment amortization changed primarily due to lower impairments of investments in management and franchise contracts 

owned leased and other 



 percentage change is not meaningful 

owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses increased primarily due to net stronger results at our owned and leased properties driven by the ongoing recovery in lodging demand from the impacts of covid19 higher termination fees of 20 million and 18 million of subsidies under german government covid19 assistance programs for certain of our leased hotels 

cost reimbursements 



 percentage change is not meaningful 

cost reimbursements net cost reimbursement revenue net of reimbursed expenses varies due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized programs and services and the related reimbursements we receive from hotel owners and franchisees over the long term our centralized programs and services are not designed to impact our economics either positively or negatively see note 2 for more information about the accounting for cost reimbursements including our loyalty program 

the increase in cost reimbursements net primarily reflects higher revenues net of expenses for our centralized programs and services this increase is partially offset by higher expenses for our loyalty program 

other operating expenses 



depreciation amortization and other expenses decreased primarily due to lower impairment charges see note 8 for more information about the operating lease impairment charges 

general administrative and other expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation costs compared to our 2020 cost reduction measures which included reducing compensation implementing reduced work weeks for many of our corporate associates and furloughing a substantial number of associates as well as higher legal expenses 34 million the increase was partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses 76 million and a favorable litigation settlement 18 million 

restructuring and mergerrelated charges decreased primarily due to the prior year increase to the put option liability discussed in note 7 243 million and 2020 restructuring charges 56 million partially offset by the 2020 partial reversal of the liability related to the ico fine which was reduced to £184 million in october 2020 39 million 

    

nonoperating income expense 



 percentage change is not meaningful 

in the 2021 third quarter we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt due to the tender offer discussed in note 9 

interest expense changed primarily due to lower credit facility and commercial paper average borrowings and interest rates partially offset by higher interest on senior note issuances net of maturities 

equity in losses changed primarily due to 2020 impairment losses 77 million and the ongoing recovery in lodging demand from the impacts of covid19 

income taxes 



our tax provision in 2021 compared to our tax benefit in 2020 primarily reflected the increase in operating income 256 million lower tax benefit from impairment charges 64 million and the prior year tax benefit from the sheraton grand chicago put option reserve 61 million the change was partially offset by the current year release of tax reserves due to favorable audit resolutions during 2021 43 million and a current year tax benefit from the loss on extinguishment of debt 42 million 

business segments 

our segment results in 2021 continued to be impacted by covid19 see the “impact of covid19” section above for more information about the impact to our business during 2021 and the discussion below for additional analysis of the operating results of our reportable business segments 





us  canada 

us  canada segment profit increased primarily due to the following

see note 5 for more information 

new accounting standards 

we do not expect that accounting standard updates issued to date and that are effective after december 31 2021 will have a material effect on our financial statements 

    

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2021 our longterm debt had a weighted average interest rate of 34 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 65 years including the effect of interest rate swaps the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 08 to 10 at yearend 2021 

in response to the negative impact covid19 had on our cash from operations in 2021 and 2020 which we expect to continue to be negatively impacted we remain focused on preserving our financial flexibility and managing our debt maturities we also remain focused on managing our corporate general and administrative costs and our capital expenditures and other investment spending share repurchases and dividends remain suspended until our leverage ratios further improve although assuming there is no meaningful setback in the global recovery from covid19 we could restart some level of capital returns in the second half of 2022 and more meaningful levels of capital returns in 2023 and beyond in 2021 we issued 18 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes redeemed all 400 million aggregate principal amount of our series n notes and repurchased and retired 1 billion aggregate principal amount of our series ee notes maturing in 2025 which we discuss further under the “sources of liquidity  senior notes issuances redemptions and repurchases” section below and in note 9 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs we currently believe the credit facility our cash on hand and our access to capital markets remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements 

sources of liquidity 

our credit facility 

our credit facility provides for up to 45 billion of aggregate borrowings for general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures letters of credit acquisitions and to support our commercial paper program if and when we resume issuing commercial paper borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating we classify outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings if any as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a longterm basis the credit facility expires on june 28 2024 as of december 31 2021 we had total outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of 11 billion and remaining borrowing capacity of 34 billion 

we entered into amendments to the credit facility in april 2020 and january 2021 the “credit facility amendments” as described in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 as amended the debt leverage covenant in the credit facility which is tested each quarter and was waived pursuant to the credit facility amendments through and including the fourth quarter of 2021 resumes beginning with the quarter ending march 31 2022 the credit facility amendments adjusted the required leverage levels for this covenant when it is reimposed starting at 550 to 100 for the test period ending on march 31 2022 and gradually stepping down to 400 to 100 over the succeeding five fiscal quarters as further described in the credit facility the credit facility amendments also amended certain other terms of the credit facility including reducing the rate floor for the libor daily floating rate and the eurocurrency rate 

our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility 

senior notes issuances redemptions and repurchases 

in january 2022 we made a 404 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire at maturity all of our outstanding series q notes 

in september 2021 we completed a tender offer the “tender offer” and purchased and retired 1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5750 percent series ee notes maturing may 1 2025 we used the net proceeds from our series ii notes offering described below and cash on hand to complete the repurchase of such series ee notes including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred as a result of the tender offer in the 2021 third quarter we recorded a loss of 164 million in the “loss on extinguishment of debt” caption of our income statements 

in september 2021 we issued 700 million aggregate principal amount of 2750 percent series ii notes due october 15 2033 the “series ii notes” we will pay interest on the series ii notes in april and october of each year commencing in april 2022 we received net proceeds of approximately 693 million from the offering of the series ii notes after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses we used the net proceeds to fund the tender offer as further described above 

    

in august 2021 we redeemed all 400 million aggregate principal amount of our series n notes due in october 2021 

in march 2021 we issued 11 billion aggregate principal amount of 2850 percent series hh notes due april 15 2031 the “series hh notes” we pay interest on the series hh notes in april and october of each year we received net proceeds of approximately 1089 million from the offering of the series hh notes after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses which were made available for general corporate purposes including the repayment of a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  

commercial paper 

due to changes to our credit ratings as a result of the impact of covid19 on our business we currently are not issuing commercial paper as a result we have had to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility and issuance of senior notes which carry higher interest costs than commercial paper 

uses of cash 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 1421 million at december 31 2021 an increase of 527 million from yearend 2020 primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities 1177 million and credit facility borrowings net of repayments 150 million partially offset by senior notes repayments net of issuances 368 million capital and technology expenditures 183 million cash paid for debt extinguishment costs associated with the tender offer 155 million and financing outflows for employee stockbased compensation withholding taxes 90 million 

cash from operations 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 462 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to net cash inflow from our loyalty program in 2020 and higher cash paid for income taxes partially offset by higher net income recorded in 2021 adjusted for noncash items and the loss on extinguishment of debt cash inflow from our loyalty program in 2020 included 920 million of cash received from the prepayment of certain future revenues under the amendments to our existing usissued cobrand credit card agreements which reduced in 2021 and will in the future reduce the amount of cash we receive from these card issuers 

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 06 to 10 at yearend 2021 and 05 to 10 at yearend 2020 we have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital and technology expenditures of 183 million in 2021 and 135 million in 2020 capital expenditures in 2021 increased by 48 million compared to 2020 primarily reflecting higher spending on our new headquarters 

we expect capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately 600 million to 700 million for 2022 including capital and technology expenditures loan advances contract acquisition costs and other investing activities including approximately 250 million for maintenance capital spending and our new headquarters 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations we have made and expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include property acquisitions and renovations new construction loans guarantees and equity investments over time we seek to minimize capital invested in our business through asset sales subject to longterm management or franchise agreements 

dispositions property and asset sales generated 12 million cash proceeds in 2021 and 260 million in 2020 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan collections net of loan advances amounted to 27 million in 2021 compared to net advances of 33 million in 2020 at yearend 2021 we had 153 million of senior mezzanine and other loans outstanding compared to 163 million outstanding at yearend 2020 

    

financing activities cash flows 

debt debt decreased by 238 million in 2021 to 10138 million at yearend 2021 from 10376 million at yearend 2020 see “sources of liquidity” caption in this “liquidity and capital resources” section and note 9 for additional information on the senior note and credit facility transactions in 2021 

share repurchases and dividends we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2021 at yearend 2021 174 million shares remained available for repurchase under board approved authorizations we also did not declare any cash dividends in 2021 we do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares or declaring cash dividends until our leverage ratios further improve assuming there is no meaningful setback in the global recovery from covid19 we could restart some level of capital returns in the second half of 2022 and more meaningful levels of capital returns in 2023 and beyond 

material cash requirements 

our material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

• at yearend 2021 we had 12169 million of debt including principal and future interest payments of which 1134 million is payable within the next 12 months from yearend 2021 see note 9 for further information about our longterm debt 

• we enter into operating and finance leases primarily for hotels offices and equipment which are discussed in note 8 

• at december 31 2021 projected deemed repatriation transition tax payments under the us tax legislation enacted on december 22 2017 commonly referred to as the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act totaled 349 million of which 43 million is payable within the next 12 months from yearend 2021 

• the company also had guarantees a contingent purchase obligation commitments and letters of credit as of yearend 2021 which are discussed in note 7 the majority of our guarantee commitments are not expected to be funded within the next 12 months from yearend 2021 in addition to the purchase obligations discussed in note 7 in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments and incur other obligations to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage since our contracts with owners require reimbursement for these amounts these obligations are expected to have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if 1 we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

while we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made actual results may differ significantly additionally changes in our assumptions estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

see note 2 for further information related to our critical accounting policies and estimates which are as follows 

loyalty program  including how we estimate the breakage of hotel points credit card points and free night certificates the volume of points and free night certificates that will be issued under our cobrand credit card agreements the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled under our cobrand credit card agreements and the standalone selling prices of goods and services provided under our cobrand credit card agreements changes in these estimates could result in material changes to our liability for guest loyalty program and loyalty program revenue based on the conditions existing at december 31 2021 and holding other factors constant a one percent decrease in our estimate of the breakage of points could result in an increase in the liability for guest loyalty program of approximately 40 million the breakage impact may vary significantly depending on the specific loyalty program points for which the anticipated breakage changes 

    

goodwill  including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill during the 2021 fourth quarter we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test and no impairment charges were recorded the estimated fair values of all our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination 

intangibles and longlived assets  including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and longlived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and longlived assets during 2021 we evaluated our intangibles and longlived asset groups for impairment and did not record any material impairment charges the estimated fair values of all our indefinitelived intangible assets significantly exceeded their carrying values at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination 

investments  including information on how we evaluate the fair value of investments and when we record impairment losses on investments during 2021 we evaluated our investments for impairment and did not record any material impairment charges 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates stock prices currency exchange rates and debt prices we manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives through the development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floatingrate notes receivable and floatingrate debt changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixedrate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt 

we use derivative instruments including cash flow hedges fair value hedges net investment in nonus operations hedges and other derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates as a matter of policy we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes see note 2 for more information on derivative instruments 

the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of yearend 2021 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks

covid19 has had an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and the company as the virus and efforts to contain it spread around the world demand at our hotels dropped significantly while 2020 generally got off to a great start we saw sudden sharp declines in hotel occupancy beginning in greater china in january 2020 and then extending around the world in april 2020 comparable systemwide constant dollar revpar experienced a record decline decreasing 90 percent worldwide compared to the prior year period and 27 percent of our hotels were temporarily closed although business at our hotels improved throughout the remainder of 2020 as compared to the extremely low levels in april 2020 covid19 continues to constrain recovery and to have a significant negative impact on demand covid19 also resulted in significantly lower new room additions than we had budgeted for 2020 and historically high levels of cancellations by group and other travelers for future periods as a result our revenues and profitability declined dramatically in 2020 compared to 2019 

we continue to take substantial measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts of covid19 for our hotel owners and our own business and we remain focused on taking care of our guests and associates we have made significant changes to our business and enhanced our liquidity position while remaining focused on how to best position ourselves for recovery and for growth over the longer term at the property level we implemented plans to help our hotel owners and franchisees reduce their cash outlays and mitigate costs and we implemented a multipronged platform to elevate cleanliness standards and hospitality norms for the health and safety of our guests and associates at the corporate level we made significant cuts in general and administrative costs and spending on capital and other investments we have substantially completed our aboveproperty restructuring program and we have implemented and are continuing to develop restructuring plans to achieve cost savings specific to each of our companyoperated properties with the steps we have taken and any additional measures we may take to adapt our operations and plans to the evolving situation along with the power of our marriott bonvoy loyalty program our strengthened liquidity position and our incredible team of associates around the world we believe that our business is well positioned now and for the future

acquisition of starwood hotels  resorts worldwide 

on september 23 2016 the “merger date” we completed the acquisition of starwood hotels  resorts worldwide llc formerly known as starwood hotels  resorts worldwide inc “starwood” through a series of transactions the “starwood combination” after which starwood became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of the company we refer to the starwood business and brands that we acquired as “legacystarwood” 

    

companyoperated properties

terms of our management agreements vary but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 15 to 30 years with options for us to renew for up to 10 or more additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a specified percentage of annual revenues that exceed a fixed amount many of our operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners many of our operating agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured those deficiencies in certain circumstances some of our management agreements allow owners to convert companyoperated properties to franchised properties under our brands 

for the lodging facilities we operate we generally are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs we provide centralized reservation services and advertising marketing and promotional services as well as various accounting and data processing services and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs 

franchised and licensed properties 

we have franchising and licensing arrangements that permit hotel owners and operators to use many of our lodging brand names and systems under our hotel franchising arrangements we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees which typically range from four to seven percent of room revenues for all brands plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain fullservice brands franchisees contribute to our marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems 

we also receive royalty fees under license agreements with marriott vacations worldwide corporation “mvw” our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011 and its affiliates for certain brands including marriott vacation club grand residences by marriott the ritzcarlton destination club westin sheraton and for certain existing properties st regis and the luxury collection we receive license fees from mvw consisting of a fixed annual fee adjusted for inflation plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes

loyalty and credit card programs 

marriott bonvoy tm is our customer loyalty program through which members have access to our diverse brand portfolio rich benefits and travel experiences we refer to marriott bonvoy throughout this report as our “loyalty program” 

our loyalty program rewards members with points toward free hotel stays access to travel experiences through our marriott bonvoy tours  activities program miles with participating airline programs and other benefits we believe that our loyalty program generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in each of 2019 and 2020 approximately 50 percent of our room nights were booked by loyalty program members we strategically market to this large and growing guest base to generate revenue see the “loyalty program” caption in note 2 for more information 

we have multiyear agreements with jpmorgan chase and american express for our usissued cobrand credit cards associated with our loyalty program we also license credit card programs internationally including in canada the united kingdom united arab emirates and japan we earn fixed amounts that are generally payable at contract inception and variable amounts that are paid to us monthly over the term of the agreements primarily based on card usage and we believe that our cobrand credit cards contribute to the success of our loyalty program and reflect the quality and value of our portfolio of brands in 2020 we signed amendments to the existing agreements for our usissued cobrand credit cards associated with our loyalty program these amendments provided the company with 920 million of cash from the prepayment of certain future revenues the early payment of a previously committed signing bonus and the prepurchase of marriott bonvoy points and other consideration 

sales and marketing and reservation systems 

marriottcom our international websites and our mobile application allow for a seamless booking experience and easy enrollment in our loyalty program to book our exclusive member rates and participate in program benefits the company responded quickly and flexibly during the covid19 crisis to meet the needs of our guests by launching new programs such as work anywhere with marriott bonvoy as well as new marriott web content focused on providing current hotel and travel information regarding covid19 our look no further ® best rate guarantee ensures best rate integrity strengthening consumer confidence in our brand and giving guests access to the best rates when they book hotel rooms through our direct channels we also remain focused on growing engagement levels with millions of guests by interacting with them through a 

    

variety of channels including our mobile application and digital guest services – contactless checkin and checkout chat service requests mobile key and more  across our hotel portfolio our digital strategy continues to focus on driving bookings to our direct channels which generally deliver more profitable business to hotels in our system compared to bookings made through intermediary channels through our direct channels we aim to create a simple and efficient digital shopping and booking experience while elevating our service through digitallyenabled guest services to generate superior guest satisfaction and enable more frictionless and memorable stays at our properties 

at yearend 2020 we operated 20 hotel reservation centers seven in the us and 13 in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own two of the us facilities and either lease the others or share space with a companyoperated property our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize thirdparty agents where cost effective economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room 

we believe our global sales and revenue management organizations are a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people processes and systems our aboveproperty sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around how the customer wants to buy reducing duplication of efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts we also utilize innovative and sophisticated revenue management systems many of which are proprietary which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increasing efficiency and optimizing propertylevel revenue for hotels in our portfolio most of the hotels in our portfolio utilize webbased programs to effectively manage the rate setup and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor other lodging management companies are primarily private management firms but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels operate hotels on behalf of thirdparty owners and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria 

our direct digital channels also compete for guests with large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as expediacom pricelinecom bookingcom travelocitycom and orbitzcom and search engines such as google bing yahoo and baidu our hotels compete for guests with other hotels and online platforms including airbnb and vrbo that allow travelers to book shortterm rentals of homes and apartments as an alternative to hotel rooms we compete for guests in many areas including brand recognition and reputation location guest satisfaction room rates quality of service amenities quality of accommodations safety and security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points 

affiliation with a brand is common in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2020 approximately 72 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the owner pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system in the franchising business we face many competitors that have strong brands and guest appeal including hilton intercontinental hotels group hyatt wyndham accor choice radisson best western and others 

outside the us branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will become more attractive in many overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers decline international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the benefits of centralized reservation systems marketing programs and our loyalty program 

based on lodging industry data we have an approximately 16 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a four percent share of the hotel market outside the us we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher revpar than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong guest preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems our loyalty program and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to guest preference across all our brands 

seasonality 

in general business at companyoperated and franchised properties fluctuates moderately with the seasons business at some resort properties may be more seasonal depending on location 

    

human capital management 

marriott’s long history of service innovation and growth was built on a commitment to take care of people today that commitment is known as takecare through our takecare commitment we are dedicated to providing opportunity community and purpose for all associates 

at yearend 2020 marriott employed approximately 121000 associates at properties customer care centers and aboveproperty operations approximately 98000 of these associates are located in the us of which approximately 20000 belong to labor unions outside the us some of our associates are represented by trade unions works councils or employee associations these numbers do not include associates employed by our hotel owners which is common outside the us or hotel personnel employed by our franchisees or other management companies hired by our franchisees marriott manages over 200000 associates who are employed by hotel owners 

as a result of covid19’s impact on our industry and the significant decline in demand for hotel rooms we had to take substantial measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts for our hotel owners and our business these measures included furloughing a substantial number of our associates and implementing reduced work weeks for other associates these furlough and reduced work week arrangements have ended at our aboveproperty locations but continue for a significant number of our onproperty associates in addition to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency we implemented restructuring plans impacting both onproperty and aboveproperty associates which included a voluntary transition program for certain associates and the elimination of a significant number of positions our propertylevel restructuring plans are ongoing as a result of covid19 and the uncertainty regarding when lodging demand and revpar levels will recover the size of our global workforce remains in transition 

during this period of disruption for our industry we continue to be focused on the needs of our associates we made a temporary policy change to offer companysubsidized health care coverage for eligible us associates on furlough and to reduce the required hours worked to allow eligible us associates to continue to qualify for companysubsidized health care coverage additionally we implemented new policies and protocols designed to help minimize the spread of covid19 at our hotels and protect our onproperty associates such as requiring all associates to wear face coverings in indoor public areas enhancing our already rigorous cleaning procedures and maintaining social distancing protocols 

we have a comprehensive compensation and benefits program designed to reward our associates and enrich their wellbeing our policies and practices are designed to avoid pay inequities throughout an associate’s career in the us salary history inquiries are prohibited during our hiring process and pay equity audits are conducted periodically in addition marriott is focused on the health and wellbeing of not only our associates but their families as well in the us we provide our associates with access to health care coverage worklife support benefits and other benefits that support families including paid parental leave and financial assistance to help with adoption fees we also offer comprehensive benefits programs for associates outside the us the terms of which vary based on the geographic market beginning in 2020 we offered associates free access to a digital tool designed to help with stress management and resiliency 

at marriott our associates’ career wellbeing is a top priority and we offer programs and resources to support our associates’ career goals from entry level to management positions through skills training programs professional development opportunities and other learning experiences we provide associates with a multitude of choices for career and personal growth we recently launched the digital learning zone focused on providing associates personalized unique learning paths 

our companywide diversity equity and inclusion program includes a range of initiatives and programs to support our efforts to make all stakeholders – associates guests owners and suppliers – feel welcome we have oversight and accountability measures in place to support our focus on equal employment diversity and inclusion the inclusion and social impact committee of our board of directors the “isi committee” helps drive accountability across the company established in 2003 the isi committee is chaired by a member of our board of directors and comprised of certain other members of the board and the company’s senior management team the isi committee assists the board in carrying out its commitment and responsibilities relating to marriott’s peoplefirst culture and the company’s efforts to foster associate wellbeing and inclusion 

    

sustainability and social impact 

guided by our 2025 sustainability and social impact goals as well as the united nations sustainable development goals we believe we have an opportunity to create a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business our sustainability and social impact platform serve 360 doing good in every direction is built around four focus areas nurture our world sustain responsible operations empower through opportunity and welcome all and advance human rights  each with targets to drive our efforts through 2025 these targets reflect our goals to protect and invest in the vitality of the communities and natural environments in which we operate build and operate sustainable hotels source responsibly advance human rights and mitigate climaterelated risk in 2020 many of our programs and initiatives including the switch from singleuse toiletry bottles to larger pumptopped bottles were slowed due to the impact of covid19 on our business nevertheless hotels across the globe supported their local communities in need by donating food cleaning supplies and other essential items and opening their doors to nonprofits that needed large event spaces in order to adhere to social distancing protocols and still meet an increase in demand for their communitysupporting services additionally together with american express and jpmorgan chase we provided 10 million worth of free hotel stays for frontline healthcare workers we deployed our marriott disaster relief fund to provide essential items such as food vouchers to marriott associates in need notwithstanding the pandemic we made progress toward our goal to train 100 percent of onproperty personnel in human trafficking awareness by 2025 and in collaboration with a leading antitrafficking organization we made our training opensourced for free access to our industry and beyond in 2021 we expect to revise and implement sustainability and social impact programming that is most pertinent to the current operating environment while helping us to address the growing expectations of our stakeholders increase our operational efficiency and excellence and enhance our reputation while mitigating risk and supporting the resiliency of our business

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to various risks that make an investment in our securities risky the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations in addition these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report or in other company communications these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations 

risks relating to covid19 

covid19 has had a material detrimental impact on our business and financial results and such impact could continue and may worsen for an unknown period of time 

covid19 has been and continues to be a complex and evolving situation with governments public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending and businesses and individuals implementing at various times and to varying degrees restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation limitations on the size of inperson gatherings closures of or occupancy or other operating limitations on work facilities lodging facilities food and beverage establishments schools public buildings and businesses cancellation of events including sporting events conferences and meetings and quarantines and lockdowns covid19 and its consequences have dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms which has and will continue to impact our business operations and financial results the extent to which covid19 impacts our business operations and financial results will depend on the 

    

factors described above and numerous other evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess including the duration and scope of covid19 the availability and distribution of effective vaccines or treatments covid19’s impact on global and regional economies and economic activity including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending its short and longerterm impact on the demand for travel transient and group business and levels of consumer confidence the ability of our owners and franchisees to successfully navigate the impacts of covid19 and how quickly economies travel activity and demand for lodging recovers after the pandemic subsides 

covid19 has subjected our business operations and financial condition to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

• risks related to revenue  covid19 has negatively impacted and will in the future negatively impact to an extent we are unable to predict our revenues from managed and franchised hotels which are primarily based on hotels’ revenues or profits in addition covid19 and its impact on global and regional economies and the hospitality industry in particular has made it difficult for hotel owners and franchisees to obtain financing on attractive terms or at all and increased the probability that hotel owners and franchisees will be unable or unwilling to service repay or refinance existing indebtedness this has caused and may in the future continue to cause some lenders to declare a default accelerate the related debt foreclose on the property or exercise other remedies and some hotel owners or franchisees to declare bankruptcy if a significant number of our management or franchise agreements are terminated as a result of bankruptcies sales or foreclosures our results of operations could be materially adversely affected hotel owners or franchisees in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us termination fees or other unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us even if hotel owners or franchisees do not declare bankruptcy the significant decline in revenues for most hotels has impacted the timely payment of amounts owed to us by some hotel owners and franchisees and could in the future materially impact the ability or willingness of hotel owners and franchisees to fund working capital or pay us other amounts that we are entitled to on a timely basis or at all which would adversely affect our liquidity if a significant number of hotels exit our system as a result of covid19 whether as a result of a hotel owner or franchisee bankruptcy failure to pay amounts owed to us a negotiated termination the exercise of contractual termination rights or otherwise our revenues and liquidity could be materially adversely affected covid19 has also materially impacted and could in the future materially impact other nonhotel related sources of revenues for us including for example our fees from our cobrand credit card arrangements which have been and may continue to be affected by covid19’s impact on spending patterns of cobrand cardholders and acquisition of new cobrand cardholders also testing our intangible assets or goodwill for impairments due to reduced revenues or cash flows could result in additional charges which could be material 

• risks related to owned and leased hotels and other real estate investments  covid19 and its impact on travel has reduced demand at nearly all hotels including our owned and leased hotels and properties owned by entities in which we have an equity investment as a result most of our owned and leased hotels and properties in which we have an investment are not generating revenue sufficient to meet expenses which is adversely affecting our income and could in the future more significantly adversely affect the value of our owned and leased properties or investments in addition we have seen and could continue to see entities in which we have an investment experience challenges securing additional or replacement financing to satisfy maturing indebtedness as a result of the foregoing we have recognized and may in the future be required to recognize significant noncash impairment charges to our results of operations 

• risks related to operations  because of the significant decline in the demand for hotel rooms we have taken steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency including furloughing a substantial number of our associates and implementing reduced work weeks for other associates implementing a voluntary transition program for certain associates eliminating a significant number of aboveproperty and onproperty positions and modifying food and beverage offerings and other services and amenities such steps and further changes we could make in the future to reduce costs for us or our hotel owners or franchisees including ongoing propertylevel restructuring plans may negatively impact guest loyalty owner preference or our ability to attract and retain associates and our reputation and market share may suffer as a result for example loss of our personnel may cause us to experience operational challenges that impact guest loyalty owner preference and our market share which could limit our ability to maintain or expand our business and could reduce our profits further reputational damage from and the financial impact of position eliminations furloughs or reduced work weeks could lead associates to depart the company and could make it harder for us or the managers of our franchised properties to recruit new associates in the future in addition if we or our hotel owners or franchisees are unable to access capital to make physical improvements to our hotels the quality of our hotels may suffer which may negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty and our revenue and market share may suffer as a result we have received demands or requests from labor unions that represent our associates and may face additional demands whether in the course of our periodic renegotiation of our collective bargaining agreements or otherwise for additional compensation healthcare benefits or other terms as a result of covid19 that 

    

could increase costs and we could experience labor disputes or disruptions as we continue to operate under our covid19 mitigation and recovery plans covid19 could also negatively affect our internal control over financial and other reporting as many of our personnel have departed the company as a result of our voluntary transition program and position eliminations and our remaining personnel are often working from home in addition new processes procedures and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment 

• risks related to expenses  covid19 has caused us to incur additional expenses and will continue to cause us to incur additional expenses in the future which are not fully reimbursed or offset by revenues for example we have already incurred certain expenses related to furloughs our voluntary transition program and position eliminations and we expect additional charges related to our propertylevel restructuring activities discussed in note 3 in future periods also if a hotel closes and has employees covered by an underfunded multiemployer pension plan we may need to pay withdrawal liability to the plan as result of such closure if it is determined that there has been a complete or partial withdrawal from the plan and we may be unable to collect reimbursement from the hotel owner in addition covid19 could make it more likely that we have to fund shortfalls in operating profit under our agreements with some hotel owners or fund financial guarantees we have made to thirdparty lenders for the timely repayment of all or a portion of certain hotel owners’ or franchisees’ debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise beyond the amounts funded or the additional guarantee reserves recorded in 2020 covid19 also makes it more likely our hotel owners or franchisees will default on loans we have made to them or will fail to reimburse us for guarantee advances our ability to recover loans and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from hotel owners or franchisees through the proceeds of hotel sales refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital even in situations where we are not obligated to provide funding to hotel owners franchisees or entities in which we have a noncontrolling interest we may choose to provide financial or other types of support to certain of these parties which could materially increase our expenses while governments have and may continue to implement various stimulus and relief programs it is uncertain whether existing programs will be effective in mitigating the impacts of covid19 and with respect to future programs to what extent we or our hotel owners or franchisees will be eligible to participate and whether conditions or restrictions imposed under such programs will be acceptable as a result of covid19 we and our hotel owners and franchisees have experienced and could continue to experience other short or longerterm impacts on costs for example related to enhanced health and hygiene requirements these effects have and could continue to impact our ability to generate profits even after revenues improve 

• risks related to growth  our growth has been and may continue to be harmed by covid19 and its various impacts as discussed above many current and prospective hotel owners and franchisees are finding it difficult or impossible to obtain hotel financing on commercially viable terms covid19 has caused and may continue to cause some projects that are in construction or development to be unable to draw on existing financing commitments or secure additional or replacement financing to complete construction and additional or replacement financing that is available may be on less favorable terms covid19 has caused and may continue to cause construction delays due to government restrictions and shortages of workers or supplies as a result some of the properties in our development pipeline will not enter our system when we anticipated or at all we have seen and may continue to see opening delays and a decrease in the rate at which new projects enter our pipeline and we may see an increase in the number of projects that fall out of our pipeline as a result of project cancellations or other factors these effects on our pipeline have reduced and will continue to reduce our ability to realize fees or realize returns on equity investments from such projects we expect we could potentially see more existing hotels exit our system as a result of covid19 and a significant number of such exits could negatively impact the overall growth of our system and our business prospects 

• risks related to liquidity  in 2020 we made significant borrowings under our 45 billion credit facility and completed offerings of 36 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes to preserve financial flexibility in light of the impact on global markets resulting from covid19 we may be required to raise additional capital again in the future to fund our operating expenses and repay maturing debt in 2020 we raised 920 million of cash through amendments to agreements with the us issuers of our cobrand credit cards associated with our loyalty program and this option to raise capital will likely not be available again to us in the near future and will reduce the amount of cash we will receive in the future from these card issuers which may increase the need for us to raise additional capital from other sources in addition we have seen increases in our cost of borrowing as a result of covid19 and such costs may increase even further for a time we are unable to determine if we are required to raise additional capital our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing our prospects our credit ratings and the outlook for the hotel industry as a whole as a result of covid19 credit agencies have downgraded our credit ratings if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our credit rating levels our industry or our company our access to capital and the cost of debt financing will be further negatively impacted the interest rate we pay on many of our existing debt instruments including the credit facility and some of our senior 

    

notes is affected by our credit ratings accordingly a downgrade may cause our cost of borrowing to further increase additionally certain of our existing commercial agreements may require us to post or increase collateral in the event of further downgrades in addition our latest amendments to our credit facility increase the minimum liquidity we are required to maintain for the duration of the waiver period as discussed in note 10 and the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations or cause future financing to be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect also if we are unable to comply with the covenants under our credit facility the lenders under our credit facility will have the right to terminate their commitments thereunder and declare the outstanding loans thereunder to be immediately due and payable a default under our credit facility could trigger a crossdefault acceleration or other consequences under other indebtedness financial instruments or agreements to which we are a party there is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations additionally the impact of covid19 on the financial markets is expected to adversely impact our ability to raise funds through equity financings 

covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from covid19 as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of covid19 could also give rise to aggravate and impact our ability to allocate resources to mitigate the other risks that we identify below which in turn could materially adversely affect our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations further covid19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations 

risks relating to our industry 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully for guests with other hotel properties and home sharing or rental services we operate in markets that contain many competitors each of our hotel brands and our home rental offering competes with major hotel chains regional hotel chains independent hotels and home sharing and rental services across national and international venues our ability to remain competitive and attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty program direct booking channels and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline further new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets 

economic downturns and other global national and regional conditions could further impact our financial results and growth because we conduct our business on a global platform changes in global national or regional economies governmental policies including in areas such as trade travel immigration healthcare and related issues and geopolitical and social conditions impact our activities our business is impacted by decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions changes in energy prices and currency values political instability heightened travel security measures travel advisories disruptions in air travel and concerns over disease violence war or terrorism 

as discussed in “risks relating to covid19” our performance has been materially affected by some of these conditions and could be further materially affected if these conditions worsen arise in the future or extend longer than anticipated or in other circumstances that we are not able to predict or mitigate even after covid19 subsides or effective vaccines or treatments become widely available our business markets growth prospects and business model could continue to be materially impacted or altered

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee the failure of the hotel owner or franchisee to comply with its payment or other obligations under the agreement a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which we fail or elect not to cure or in certain limited cases other negotiated contractual termination rights some courts have also applied agency law principles and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have interpreted hotel management agreements to be “personal services contracts” property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future when terminations occur for these or other reasons we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses we may have difficulty collecting damages from the hotel owner or franchisee and any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and 

    

other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management or franchise agreement a significant loss of these agreements could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or delay implementation of product or service initiatives consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product service or systems initiatives the timing and amount of capital investments and reimbursement for operating costs system costs or other amounts such disagreements may become more likely in the current environment and during other periods when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners franchisees and real estate investment partners but we cannot always do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in an adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom pricelinecom bookingcom travelocitycom and orbitzcom as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although our best rate guarantee and member rate programs have helped limit guest preference shift to intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract guests including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google bing yahoo and baidu to steer guests toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court our business and profitability could be harmed to the extent that online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from our direct online channels or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels in addition if we are not able to negotiate new agreements on satisfactory terms when our existing contracts with intermediaries which generally have 2 to 3 year terms come up for renewal our business and prospects could be negatively impacted in a number of ways for example if newly negotiated agreements are on terms less favorable to our hotels than the expiring agreements or if we are not able to negotiate new agreements and our hotels no longer appear on intermediary websites our bookings could decline our profits and the operating profits of hotels in our system could decline and customers and owners may be less attracted to our brands we may not be able to recapture or offset any such loss of business through actions we take to enhance our direct marketing and reservation channels or to rely on other channels or other intermediary websites 

our growth strategy depends upon attracting thirdparty owners and franchisees to our platform and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable to us depending on the terms offered by our competitors our growth strategy for adding lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements and franchise agreements for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future arrangements renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the us makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation a significant number of rooms in our system are located outside of the us and its territories to the extent that our international operations continue to grow this increasingly exposes us to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the us many of which are outside of our control and which could materially reduce our revenues or profits materially increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions significantly disrupt our business or significantly damage our reputation these challenges and risks include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and government policies that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls trade restrictions and health and safety requirements 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as competition laws cybersecurity and privacy laws data localization requirements currency regulations national security laws trade and economic sanctions and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 4 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws and 5 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism war pandemics or other health emergencies border control measures or other travel restrictions or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation 

    

any failure by our international operations to comply with anticorruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs reduce our profits limit our growth harm our reputation or subject us to broader liability we are subject to restrictions imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and anticorruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations such as the uk bribery act anticorruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain payments to government officials or other persons in order to influence official acts or decisions or to obtain or retain business these laws also require us to maintain adequate internal controls and accurate books and records we have properties in many parts of the world where corruption is common and our compliance with anticorruption laws may potentially conflict with local customs and practices the compliance programs internal controls and policies we maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws may not prevent our associates contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations we are also subject to trade sanctions and regulations administered by the us office of foreign assets control the us department of commerce and other us government agencies and authorities in other countries where we do business our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules the us or other countries may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in or with which or persons or entities with whom we do business depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed our operations in the relevant country or with the relevant individual or entity could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected any violations of anticorruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties reduce our profits disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation or result in lawsuits or regulatory actions being brought against the company or its officers or directors in addition the operation of these laws and regulations or an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities cease operations in certain countries or limit certain business operations that would otherwise support growth 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us accordingly fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues we are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our nonus business are generally reported in local currency which we then translate to us dollars for inclusion in our financial statements as a result exchange rate changes between foreign currencies and the us dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results we expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our nonus operations increases we enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to mitigate exposure to some of the foreign currency fluctuations but these efforts may not be successful these hedging agreements also do not cover all currencies in which we do business do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our company and our brands and any deterioration could adversely impact our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations many factors can affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or brands and the value of our brands including service food quality and safety safety of our guests and associates our approach to health and cleanliness our approach to managing and reducing our carbon footprint availability and management of scarce natural resources supply chain management ability to protect and use our brands and trademarks diversity human rights and support for local communities reputational value is also based on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us our brands and our hotels and it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or penalties or litigation negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including lost sales boycotts reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program loss of development opportunities adverse government attention or associate retention and recruiting difficulties any material decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our brands or corporate image could affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

actions by our franchisees and licensees or others could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties for lodging timeshare and residential properties and with respect to our credit card programs under the terms of their agreements with us these third parties interact directly with guests and others under our brand and trade names if these third parties fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems including any data or privacy incident involving guest information or a circumstance involving guest or associate health or safety or project a brand image inconsistent with ours then our image and reputation could suffer although our agreements with these parties provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances it could be expensive or time consuming for us to 

    

pursue such remedies  we also cannot assure you that in every instance a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights or that we could collect any awarded damages from the defaulting party 

collective bargaining activity and strikes could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs and interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies  a significant number of associates at our managed leased and owned hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements if relationships with our organized associates or the unions that represent them become adverse then the properties we operate could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations numerous collective bargaining agreements are typically subject to negotiation each year and our ability in the past to resolve such negotiations does not mean that we will be able to resolve future negotiations without strikes disruptions or on terms that we consider reasonable labor disputes and disruptions have in the past and could in the future result in adverse publicity and adversely affect operations and revenues at affected hotels in addition labor disputes and disruptions could harm our relationship with our associates result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities harm our relationships with our guests and customers divert management attention and reduce customer demand for our services all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses and legal costs and could impose limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by the operators of our franchised properties increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

our business could suffer as the result of the loss of the services of our senior executives or if we cannot attract and retain talented associates we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses a shortage of skilled labor could also result in higher wages that would increase our labor costs which could reduce our profits in addition the efforts and abilities of our senior executives are important elements of maintaining our competitive position and driving future growth and the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives could result in challenges executing our business strategies or other adverse effects on our business the impact of covid19 on the hospitality industry and actions that we and others in the hospitality industry have taken and may take in the future with respect to our associates and executives in response to covid19 may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain associates and executives in the future 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease violence or war have reduced the demand for lodging which has adversely affected our revenues we have seen a decline in travel and reduced demand for lodging due to so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods volcanic activity wildfires and other natural disasters as well as manmade disasters and the spread of contagious diseases in locations where we own manage or franchise properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of guests and these circumstances could continue or worsen in the future to an extent and for durations that we are not able to predict actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest civil or geopolitical strife and other acts of violence could have a similar effect as with the effects we have already experienced from the covid19 pandemic any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for lodging limit the room rates that can be charged andor increase our operating costs all of which could adversely affect our profits if a terrorist event or other incident of violence were to involve one or more of our branded properties demand for our properties in particular could suffer disproportionately which could further hurt our revenues and profits 

insurance may not cover damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise or other aspects of our business and the cost of such insurance could increase we require comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed leased and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary we also require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we our hotel owners or our franchisees can obtain or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods terrorist acts pandemics or liabilities that result from incidents involving the security of information systems may result in high deductibles low limits or may be uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance may be unacceptably high as a result we our hotel owners and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels or may not be successful in obtaining insurance at all for example over the past several years following the severe and widespread damage caused by the 2017 atlantic hurricane season and other natural disasters coupled with continued large global losses the property liability and other insurance markets have seen significant cost increases also 

    

due to the data security incident involving unauthorized access to the starwood reservations database which we initially reported in november 2018 the “data security incident” and the state of the cyber insurance market generally the costs for our cyber insurance increased with both our 2019 and 2020 renewals and the cost of such insurance could continue to increase for future policy periods further in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we our hotel owners or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result our revenues and profits could be adversely affected and for properties we own or lease we could lose some or all of the capital that we have invested in the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations 

if our brands goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record significant noncash charges to earnings as of december 31 2020 we had 182 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred estimated fair values of our brands or reporting units could change if for example there are changes in the business climate unanticipated changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in guests’ perception and the reputation of our brands or changes in interest rates operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations 

development and financing risks 

while we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners and franchisees depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and they may be unable to access capital when necessary both we and current and potential hotel owners and franchisees must periodically spend money to fund new hotel investments as well as to refurbish and improve existing hotels the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners and franchisees depends in large measure on their ability to access the capital markets over which we have little control obtaining financing on attractive terms has been and may in the future be further constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing availability planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy and rate changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction demand for construction resources and other disruptive conditions in global regional or local markets 

our renovation activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks we occasionally acquire and renovate hotel properties both directly and through partnerships and other business structures with third parties this presents a number of risks including that 1 weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we partner to raise capital for completion of projects 2 properties that we renovate could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or time we anticipate or we may be required to record additional impairment charges and 3 construction delays or cost overruns including those due to shortages or increased costs of skilled labor andor materials lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase project costs we could face similar risks to the extent we undertake development activities again in the future 

our owned properties and other real estate investments subject us to numerous risks  we have a number of owned and leased properties which are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property we may seek to sell some of these properties over time however equity real estate investments can be difficult to sell quickly and covid19 has disrupted the transaction markets for hospitality assets we may not be able to complete asset sales at prices we find acceptable or at all moreover the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated if any by the related properties and the expenses incurred a variety of other factors also affect income from properties and real estate values including local market conditions and new supply of hotels availability and costs of staffing governmental regulations insurance zoning tax and eminent domain laws interest rate levels and the availability of financing our real estate properties have been and could in the future be impacted by any of these factors resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition if our properties continue to not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses including needed capital expenditures our income could be further 

    

adversely affected and we could be required to record additional significant noncash impairment charges to our results of operations 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits we participate through licensing agreements in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under many of our luxury and premium brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including risks that 1 weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future project developers of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or the tax benefits of mortgage financing or residential ownership generally or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims or claims related to purchaser deposits and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

more hotel projects in our development pipeline may be cancelled or delayed in opening which could adversely affect our growth prospects we report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline including hotels under construction hotels subject to signed contracts and hotels approved for development but not yet under contract the eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and in particular the approved hotels that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including the risks described above in the risk factors entitled “ our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments” and “covid19 has had a material detrimental impact on our business and financial results and such impact could continue and may worsen for an unknown period of time risks related to growth” we have seen construction timelines for pipeline hotels lengthen due to competition for skilled construction labor disruption in the supply chain for materials and the impact of covid19 generally and these circumstances could continue or worsen in the future accordingly we cannot assure you that all of our development pipeline will result in new hotels entering our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties impact our profits at times we make loans for hotel development acquisition or renovation expenditures when we enter into or amend management or franchise agreements from time to time we also provide thirdparty lenders with financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings we have suffered losses and could suffer losses in the future when hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded 

if owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed the owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced if those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all the lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and foreclose on the property or the owners could declare bankruptcy as we have seen in the past and could see in the future such foreclosures or bankruptcies have in the past and could in the future in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows which could have a significant negative effect our results of operations 

changes affecting the availability of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may have consequences that we cannot yet reasonably predict we are a party to various agreements and other instruments where obligations by or to us are calculated based on or otherwise dependent on libor in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor as early as the end of 2021 as a result libor may perform differently than in the past and may ultimately cease to be utilized or to exist either during or after 2021 alternative benchmark rates may replace libor and could affect our agreements that reference libor not all of which contain alternative rate provisions certain of our agreements reference libor including for example our credit facility and certain other financial agreements like loans guaranties and derivatives at this time it is difficult for us to predict the effect of any changes to libor any phase out of libor or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates to replace libor there is uncertainty about how we the financial markets applicable law and the courts will address the replacement of libor with alternative benchmark rates for contracts that do not include fallback provisions to provide for such alternative benchmark rates in addition any changes from libor to an alternative benchmark rate may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds our receipts or payments under agreements that reference libor and the valuation of derivative or other contracts to which we are a party any of which could impact our results of operations and cash flows 

    

technology information protection and privacy risks 

any disruption in the functioning of our reservation systems could adversely affect our performance and results we manage global reservation systems that communicate reservations to our hotels from individuals who book reservations directly with us online through our mobile apps through our telephone call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed accuracy and efficiency of our reservation systems are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands our business may suffer if we fail to maintain upgrade or prevent disruption to our reservation systems disruptions in or changes to our reservation systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management property management human resources and payroll systems our loyalty program and technologies we make available to our guests and for our associates these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and our business could suffer if we cannot do that as quickly or effectively as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of company associate and guest data in the operation of our business we collect store use and transmit large volumes of data regarding associates guests customers owners licensees franchisees and our own business operations including credit card numbers reservation and loyalty data and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in systems maintained by third parties including our owners franchisees licensees and service providers the integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business our guests and associates also have a high expectation that we as well as our owners franchisees licensees and service providers will adequately protect and appropriately use their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by laws and governmental regulation our contractual obligations and the requirements of the payment card industry are also becoming more stringent in many jurisdictions in which we operate our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners franchisees licensees and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing legal and regulatory requirements and associate and guest expectations or may require significant additional investments or time to do so we may incur significant additional costs to meet these requirements obligations and expectations and in the event of alleged or actual noncompliance we may experience increased operating costs increased exposure to fines and litigation and increased risk of damage to our reputation and brand 

the data security incident and other information security incidents could have numerous adverse effects on our business as a result of the data security incident we are a party to or have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits primarily putative class actions brought by consumers and others in the us and canada one securities class action lawsuit in the us three shareholder derivative lawsuits in the us and one purported representative action brought by a purported consumer class in the uk we may be named as a party in additional lawsuits and other claims may be asserted by or on behalf of guests customers hotel owners stockholders or others seeking monetary damages or other relief related to the data security incident a number of federal state and foreign governmental authorities have also made inquiries opened investigations or requested information andor documents related to the data security incident including under various data protection and privacy regulations responding to and resolving these lawsuits claims andor investigations has resulted in fines such as the fine imposed by the information commissioner’s office in the united kingdom the “ico” as discussed in note 8 and could result in material additional fines or remedial or other expenses these fines and other expenses may not be covered by insurance governmental authorities investigating or seeking information about the data security incident also may seek to impose undertakings injunctive relief consent decrees or other civil or criminal penalties which could among other things materially increase our data security costs or otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business significant management time and company resources have been and will continue to be devoted to the data security incident future publicity or developments related to the data security incident including as a result of subsequent reports or regulatory actions or developments could have a range of other adverse effects on our business or prospects including causing or contributing to loss of consumer confidence reduced consumer demand reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program loss of development opportunities and associate retention and recruiting difficulties insurance coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data security incident may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses including the final fine imposed by the ico and any other fines or penalties related to the data security incident in addition following our march 31 2020 announcement of an incident involving information for approximately 55 million guests that we believe may have been improperly accessed through an application using the login credentials of two franchise employees at a franchise property the “unauthorized application access incident” various governmental authorities opened investigations or requested information about the incident and two lawsuits were filed against 

    

us related to the incident the unauthorized application access incident or publicity related to it could negatively affect our business or reputation 

additional cybersecurity incidents could have adverse effects on our business we have implemented security measures to safeguard our systems and data and we intend to continue implementing additional measures in the future but as we have seen in the past our measures may not be sufficient to maintain the confidentiality security or availability of the data we collect store and use to operate our business measures taken by our service providers or our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or their service providers also may not be sufficient efforts to hack or circumvent security measures efforts to gain unauthorized access to exploit or disrupt the operation or integrity of our data or systems failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses “ransomware” or other malware “supply chain” attacks “phishing” or other types of business communications compromises operator error or inadvertent releases of data have impacted and may in the future impact our information systems and records or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by third parties to gain unauthorized access or prevent authorized access to such systems have greatly increased in recent years our increased reliance on cloudbased services and on remote access to information systems in response to covid19 increases the company’s exposure to potential cybersecurity incidents we have experienced cyberattacks attempts to disrupt access to our systems and data and attempts to affect the operation or integrity of our data or systems and the frequency and sophistication of such efforts could continue to increase any additional significant theft of unauthorized access to compromise or loss of loss of access to or fraudulent use of guest associate owner franchisee licensee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in legal regulatory and other consequences including remedial and other expenses fines or litigation depending on the nature and scope of the event future compromises in the security of our information systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers or other future disruptions or compromises of data or systems could lead to an interruption in or other adverse effects on the operation of our systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits and could result in negative publicity and other adverse effects on our business including lost sales loss of consumer confidence boycotts reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program litigation loss of development opportunities or associate satisfaction retention and recruiting difficulties all of which could materially affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

because we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past additional incidents or the failure to detect and appropriately respond to additional incidents could magnify the severity of the adverse effects on our business the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage information systems change frequently can be difficult to detect for long periods of time and can involve difficult or prolonged assessment or remediation periods even once detected which could also magnify the severity of these adverse effects we cannot assure you that all potential causes of past significant incidents have been identified and remediated additional measures may be needed to prevent significant incidents in the future the steps we take may not be sufficient to prevent future significant incidents and as a result such incidents may occur again although we carry cyber insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks that insurance coverage may not be sufficient or available to cover all expenses or other losses including fines or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyberattacks security compromises and other related incidents furthermore in the future such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

changes in privacy and data security laws could increase our operating costs and increase our exposure to fines and litigation we are subject to numerous complex and frequently changing laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information nonus data privacy and data security laws various us federal and state laws payment card industry security standards and other information privacy and security standards are all applicable to us significant legislative judicial or regulatory changes could be issued in the future compliance with changes in applicable data privacy laws and regulations and contractual obligations including responding to investigations into our compliance may restrict our business operations increase our operating costs increase our exposure to fines and litigation in the event of alleged noncompliance and adversely affect our reputation following the data security incident certain regulators also opened investigations into our privacy and security policies and practices as a result of these investigations we could be exposed to significant fines and remediation costs in addition to those imposed as a result of the data security incident and adverse publicity related to the investigations could adversely affect our reputation 

changes in laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal or state laws on marketing and solicitation or international privacy eprivacy and antispam laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential guests and customers from travel service providers or other companies with 

    

whom we have substantial relationships and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were to be prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new guests and customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

governance risk 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of directors consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder rights plan 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we describe our companyoperated properties in part i item 1 “business” earlier in this report and under the “properties and rooms” caption in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we believe our owned and leased properties are in generally good physical condition with the need for only routine repairs and maintenance and periodic capital improvements most of our regional offices reservation centers and sales offices as well as our corporate headquarters are in leased facilities both domestically and internationally 

as of december 31 2020 we owned or leased the following hotel properties 



    






 item 3 legal proceedings 

see the information under the “litigation claims and government investigations” caption in note 8 which we incorporate here by reference within this section we use a threshold of 1 million in disclosing material environmental proceedings involving a governmental authority 

in may 2020 we received a notice from the district attorneys of the counties of placer riverside san francisco and san mateo in california asserting that nine properties in california have failed to comply with certain state statutes regulating hazardous and other waste handling and disposal we are cooperating with the district attorneys’ requests for information and have entered into a tolling agreement with the district attorneys we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter however management does not believe that the outcome will have a material adverse effect on the company 

from time to time we are also subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including adjustments proposed during governmental examinations of the various tax returns we file while management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these other proceedings individually and in aggregate will not materially harm our 

    

financial position cash flows or overall trends in results of operations legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and unfavorable rulings could individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results

business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotel residential and timeshare properties in 133 countries and territories under 30 brand names under our assetlight business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them we discuss our operations in the following three reportable business segments us  canada asia pacific and europe middle east and africa “emea” our caribbean and latin america “cala” operating segment does not meet the applicable accounting criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment and we include its results in “unallocated corporate and other” in january 2021 we modified our reportable segment structure as a result of a change in the way management intends to evaluate results and allocate resources within the company beginning with the 2021 first quarter we will report the following two operating segments us  canada and international 

    

we earn base management fees and under many agreements incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us in most markets base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue or certain propertylevel revenue in the case of franchise fees while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return for our hotels in the middle east and africa and in the asia pacific region incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit also referred to as “house profit” less noncontrollable expenses such as property insurance real estate taxes and capital spending reserves additionally we earn franchise fees for use of our intellectual property including fees from our cobrand credit card timeshare and residential programs 

starwood data security incident 

on november 30 2018 we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the starwood reservations database the “data security incident” the starwood reservations database is no longer used for business operations 

in july 2019 the ico issued a formal notice of intent under the uk data protection act 2018 the “uk dpa” proposing a fine in the amount of £99 million against the company in relation to the data security incident in october 2020 the ico issued a final decision under the uk dpa which includes a fine of £184 million the company did not appeal the ico’s decision but has made no admission of liability in relation to the decision or the underlying allegations in 2019 we expensed 65 million for this loss contingency in the “restructuring and mergerrelated charges” caption of our income statements based on the fine initially proposed by the ico in july 2019 and the ongoing proceeding in 2020 we recorded a 39 million reversal of expense based on the ico’s issuance of the final decision we paid a portion of the ico fine in the 2020 fourth quarter and the remainder is payable over the next two years our accrual for this loss contingency which we present in the “accrued expenses and other” and “other noncurrent liabilities” captions of our balance sheets was 65 million at yearend 2019 and 17 million at yearend 2020 see note 8 for additional information 

we are currently unable to estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the company from the data security incident in excess of the expenses already incurred however we do not believe this incident will impact our longterm financial health although our insurance program includes coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data security incident that insurance may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses including fines and penalties related to the data security incident as we expected the cost of such insurance again increased for our current policy period and the cost of such insurance could continue to increase for future policy periods we expect to incur significant expenses associated with the data security incident in future periods primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations including possible additional fines and penalties increased expenses and capital investments for information technology and information security and data privacy and increased expenses for compliance activities and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements see note 8 for additional information related to expenses incurred in 2020 and 2019 insurance recoveries and legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the data security incident 

performance measures 

we believe revenue per available room “revpar” which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which are components of calculating revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available including rooms in hotels temporarily closed due to issues related to covid19 measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we define our comparable properties as our properties that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year since january 1 2019 for the current period and have not in either the current or previous year 1 undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions 2 been converted between companyoperated and franchised or 3 sustained substantial property damage or business interruption with the exception of properties closed or otherwise experiencing interruptions related to covid19 which we continue to classify as comparable for 2020 compared to 2019 we had 4641 comparable us  canada properties and 1340 comparable international properties 

    

impact of covid19 

covid19 continues to have a material impact on our business our company and our industry covid19 first impacted our business in greater china beginning in january 2020 moved quickly into the rest of asia pacific and the european markets and spread globally by march 2020 as the pandemic accelerated around the world worldwide comparable systemwide constant dollar revpar fell sharply global occupancy levels and revpar have since improved compared to the extremely low levels reached in april 2020 but the pace of recovery generally slowed in most regions in the 2020 fourth quarter and into january 2021 due to the sharp rise in covid19 cases as a result our fee revenue and revenue from owned and leased properties declined significantly during 2020 and we expect that there will not be a significant rebound in travel and lodging demand until there is widespread distribution of effective vaccines 

worldwide comparable systemwide constant dollar revpar declined 23 percent in the 2020 first quarter 84 percent in the 2020 second quarter 66 percent in the 2020 third quarter and 64 percent in the 2020 fourth quarter compared to the same periods in 2019 worldwide approximately six percent of our hotels were closed as of february 15 2021 compared to the peak of more than 25 percent closed on april 26 2020 however the progress of recovery is uneven the spread of covid19 has constrained and continues to constrain the speed of recovery and will continue to have a dampening impact on demand demand is still being primarily driven by leisure travelers and we have not seen meaningful demand return from business and group travelers 

of our geographic regions greater china experienced the greatest improvement in demand compared to the 2020 second quarter driven initially by domestic leisure travel with business transient and group business improving through the year while demand in the rest of asia pacific has generally improved at a much slower pace in our europe middle east and africa region leisure demand drove revpar improvements in the 2020 third quarter compared to the 2020 second quarter though increases in covid19 cases in europe and resulting increases in government restrictions began anew in september 2020 which negatively impacted the recovery in the 2020 fourth quarter in us  canada demand improved during the remainder of 2020 from the lows seen in april 2020 primarily driven by leisure travel and by travelers within driving range of their destinations 

we continue to take substantial measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts for our hotel owners and our own business business contingency plans have been implemented around the world and we continue to adjust these in response to the global situation at the corporate level our actions to date have substantially reduced the monthly run rate of corporate general and administrative costs compared to the monthly costs initially budgeted for 2020 excluding our provision for credit losses we reduced spending on capital expenditures and other investments and as previously announced we suspended share repurchases and cash dividends 

we have taken a number of steps to reorganize the company in response to the decline in lodging demand caused by covid19 we implemented temporary furloughs and reduced work week schedules for both aboveproperty and onproperty associates most of which ended in september 2020 for aboveproperty associates as part of the realignment of our organization we implemented a voluntary transition program for certain associates and we eliminated a significant number of positions while we have substantially completed the programs related to our aboveproperty organization we are continuing to develop restructuring plans which could result in additional onproperty position eliminations to achieve cost savings specific to each of our companyoperated properties see note 3 for more information about our restructuring activities 

at the property level we continue to work with owners and franchisees to lower their cash outlays the steps we have taken to date include deferring renovations certain hotel initiatives and brand standard audits for hotel owners and franchisees reducing the amount of certain charges for systemwide programs and services offering a delay in payment terms for certain charges in the 2020 second quarter supporting owners and franchisees who are working with their lenders to utilize furniture fixtures and equipment ffe reserves to meet working capital needs and waiving required ffe funding through 2021 we have significantly lowered the reimbursed expenses we incur on behalf of our owners and franchisees to provide centralized programs and services such as the loyalty program reservations marketing and sales which we generally collect through cost reimbursement revenue on the basis of hotel revenue or program usage in 2020 we applied for employee retention tax credit refunds from the us treasury under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” totaling 164 million in the 2020 fourth quarter we received 119 million 94 million of which we passed through to the related hotels that we manage on behalf of owners we expect to receive the remaining refund in 2021 the majority of which we expect will inure to the benefit of our hotel owners we continue to evaluate the availability of credits and benefits under the cares act and other legislation 

the impact of covid19 on the company remains fluid as does our corporate and propertylevel response and we expect to continue to assess and may implement additional measures to adapt our operations and plans as we continue to evaluate the implications of covid19 on our business the overall operational and financial impact is highly dependent on 

    

the breadth and duration of covid19 including the availability and distribution of effective vaccines or treatments and could be affected by other factors we are not currently able to predict 

system growth and pipeline 

in 2020 our system grew from 7349 properties 1380921 rooms at yearend 2019 to 7642 properties 1423044 rooms at yearend 2020 reflecting the addition of 399 properties 62776 rooms and the exit of 106 properties 20416 rooms approximately 45 percent of added rooms are located outside us  canada and 13 percent are conversions from competitor brands 

at yearend 2020 we had more than 498000 rooms in our development pipeline which includes hotel rooms under construction hotel rooms under signed contracts and roughly 20000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts over 229000 rooms in our development pipeline were under construction at yearend 2020 over half of the rooms in our development pipeline are outside us  canada in 2020 we signed management and franchise agreements for 1575 properties 248660 rooms 

in 2021 we expect gross rooms growth of approximately 60 percent 30 to 35 percent net of deletions 

properties and rooms 

at yearend 2020 we operated franchised and licensed the following properties and rooms 



    

lodging statistics 

the following tables present revpar occupancy and adr statistics for comparable properties for 2020 and 2020 compared to 2019 systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties in addition to our companyoperated properties

2 includes asia pacific cala and emea 

3 includes us  canada and international  all 

consolidated results 

our results declined in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impact of covid19 see the “impact of covid19” section above for more information about the impact to our business during 2020 and the discussion below for additional analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2020 and 2019 

fee revenues 



the decrease in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected lower revpar and lower cobrand credit card fees of 84 million primarily due to covid19 as well as lower fees from properties that left the system of 32 million the decrease in franchise fees was partially offset by unit growth 37 million 

the decrease in incentive management fees was primarily due to covid19 in 2020 we earned incentive management fees from 37 percent of our managed properties worldwide compared to 72 percent in 2019 we earned incentive management fees from 3 percent of managed properties in us  canada and 56 percent of managed properties outside us  canada in 2020 compared to 57 percent in us  canada and 81 percent outside us  canada in 2019 in addition 92 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2020 came from our managed properties outside us  canada primarily in asia pacific versus 65 percent in 2019 

    

contract investment amortization increased primarily due to higher impairments of investments in management and franchise contracts primarily due to covid19 

owned leased and other 



owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased primarily due to lower demand at and the temporary closure of certain of our owned and leased hotels due to covid19 as well as net lower owned and leased profits attributable to hotels sold in the 2019 fourth and 2020 first quarters 19 million 

cost reimbursements 



cost reimbursements net cost reimbursement revenue net of reimbursed expenses varies due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized programs and services and the related reimbursements we receive from hotel owners and franchisees primarily driven by our loyalty program over the long term our centralized programs and services are not designed to impact our economics either positively or negatively see note 2 for more information about the accounting for our loyalty program 

the increase in cost reimbursements net in 2020 primarily reflects the performance of the loyalty program which had lower program expenses and redemptions 

other operating expenses 



depreciation amortization and other expenses increased primarily due to higher operating lease impairment charges 16 million see note 9 for more information about the operating lease impairment charges 

general administrative and other expenses decreased primarily due to lower administrative costs due to our cost reduction measures and 20 million of lower legal expenses the decrease was partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and higher guarantee reserves primarily due to the negative current and expected economic impact of covid19 105 million 

restructuring and mergerrelated charges increased primarily due to the increased put option liability discussed in note 8 243 million and 2020 restructuring charges 56 million partially offset by the ico fine discussed in note 8 104 million representing the 2019 accrual and the 2020 reversal the 2019 impairment charge of a legacystarwood office building 34 million and lower integration costs 19 million 

nonoperating income expense 



    

gains and other income net decreased primarily due to the 2019 gains on our property sales 134 million 

interest expense increased primarily due to higher interest on senior note issuances net of maturities 93 million partially offset by lower commercial paper and credit facility interest rates and aggregate average borrowings 24 million and net lower interest rates on floating rate debt 22 million 

equity in losses earnings decreased due to losses recorded by the investees and impairment charges 77 million primarily as a result of covid19 

income taxes 



our tax benefit in 2020 compared to our tax provision in 2019 primarily reflected the decrease in operating income 336 million the tax benefit from the release of tax reserves due to audit closures during 2020 100 million the tax benefit from the sheraton grand chicago put option reserve 61 million the yearoveryear tax benefit from impairment charges 39 million and the prior year tax expense incurred for us tax on global intangible lowtaxed income 35 million the decrease was partially offset by a shift in earnings to jurisdictions with higher tax rates 36 million 

business segments 

our segment results declined in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impact of covid19 see the “impact of covid19” section above for more information about the impact to our business during 2020 and the discussion below for additional analysis of the operating results of our reportable business segments segment revenues and profits for emea a new reportable segment in 2020 did not change significantly in 2019 compared to 2018

liquidity and capital resources 

our longterm financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2020 our longterm debt had a weighted average interest rate of 37 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 60 years including the effect of interest rate swaps the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 08 to 10 at yearend 2020 

in response to the negative impact covid19 had on our cash from operations in 2020 which we expect to continue to be negatively impacted as discussed above we have taken numerous actions to preserve our financial flexibility and manage our debt maturities which include 

• substantially reducing our corporate general and administrative costs reimbursed expenses we incur on behalf of our owners and franchisees and our capital expenditures and other investment spending and implementing restructuring plans as we discuss under the “impact of covid19” section above 

• suspending share repurchases and dividends until conditions improve and until permitted under our credit facility 

• drawing under the credit facility as we discuss under the “sources of liquidityour credit facility” section below 

• amending the credit facility to among other things waive the quarterlytested leverage covenant in the credit facility through and including the fourth quarter of 2021 as we discuss under the “sources of liquidityour credit facility” section below 

• issuing 36 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and repurchasing and retiring approximately 853 million aggregate principal amount of the company’s outstanding senior notes maturing in 2022 which we discuss under the “sources of liquidity  senior notes issuances and repurchases” section below and 

• raising 920 million of cash by entering into amendments to the existing agreements for our usissued cobrand credit cards which we discuss under the “cobrand credit card agreements” section below 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs we currently believe the credit facility our cash on hand and our access to capital markets remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements 

sources of liquidity 

our credit facility 

our credit facility provides for up to 45 billion of aggregate borrowings for general corporate needs including to support our commercial paper program if and when we resume issuing commercial paper borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating we classify outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a longterm basis the credit facility expires on june 28 2024 in 2020 we made borrowings of 45 billion and repayments of 36 billion resulting in total outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of 09 billion as of december 31 2020 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility and generally consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to ebitda each as defined in the credit facility and subject to additional adjustments as described therein on april 13 2020 we entered into an amendment to the credit facility the “first credit facility amendment” under which the covenant governing the permitted leverage ratio is waived through and including the first quarter of 2021 the “covenant waiver period” which waiver period may end sooner at our election and the required leverage levels for such covenant are adjusted once reimposed at the end of the covenant waiver period starting at 550 to 100 when the leverage test is first reimposed and gradually stepping down to 400 to 100 over the succeeding seven fiscal quarters as further described in the credit facility the first credit facility amendment also imposes a monthlytested minimum liquidity covenant for the duration of the covenant waiver period and makes certain other amendments to the terms of the credit facility including increasing the interest and fees payable on the credit facility for the duration of the covenant waiver period tightening certain existing covenants and imposing additional covenants for the duration of the covenant waiver period including restricting dividends and share repurchases 

on january 26 2021 we entered into two more amendments to the credit facility the “new credit facility amendments” and together with the first credit facility amendment the “credit facility amendments” which extend the 

    

covenant waiver period through and including the fourth quarter of 2021 which waiver period may end sooner at our election revise the required leverage levels for such covenant when it is reimposed at the end of the covenant waiver period starting at 550 to 100 when the leverage test is first reimposed and gradually stepping down to 400 to 100 over the succeeding five fiscal quarters as further described in the credit facility and increase the minimum liquidity amount under the liquidity covenant that is tested monthly for the duration of the covenant waiver period the new credit facility amendments also make certain other amendments to the terms of the credit facility including reducing the rate floor for the libor daily floating rate and the eurocurrency rate 

our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility including the liquidity covenant under the credit facility 

senior notes issuances and repurchases 

on april 16 2020 we issued 16 billion aggregate principal amount of 5750 percent series ee notes due may 1 2025 the “series ee notes”  we pay interest on the series ee notes in may and november of each year commencing in november 2020 we received net proceeds of approximately 1581 billion from the offering of the series ee notes after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses which were made available for general corporate purposes 

on june 1 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 4625 percent series ff notes due june 15 2030 the “series ff notes” we pay interest on the series ff notes in june and december of each year commencing in december 2020 we received net proceeds of approximately 985 million from the offering of the series ff notes after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses we used the majority of these proceeds to repurchase senior notes with near term maturities as discussed below and in note 10 

in june 2020 we completed a tender offer the “tender offer” and retired 853 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes consisting of 

• 351 million of our 23 series q notes maturing january 15 2022 

• 176 million of our 33 series l notes maturing september 15 2022 and 

• 326 million of our 21 series dd notes maturing october 3 2022 

we used proceeds from our series ff notes offering to complete the repurchase of such notes including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred 

on august 14 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 3500 percent series gg notes due october 15 2032 the “series gg notes” we will pay interest on the series gg notes in april and october of each year commencing in april 2021 we received net proceeds of approximately 984 million from the offering of the series gg notes after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses which were made available for general corporate purposes including the repayment of a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 

commercial paper 

due to changes to our credit ratings as a result of the impact of covid19 on our business we currently are not issuing commercial paper as a result we have had to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility and issuance of senior notes which carry higher interest costs than our commercial paper 

cobrand credit card agreements 

in may 2020 we signed amendments to the existing agreements for our usissued cobrand credit cards associated with our loyalty program these amendments provided the company with 920 million of cash from the prepayment of certain future revenues the early payment of a previously committed signing bonus and the prepurchase of marriott bonvoy points and other consideration we recorded the amount of cash received primarily in the deferred revenue caption and the remainder in the liability for guest loyalty program captions on our balance sheet 

uses of cash 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 894 million at december 31 2020 an increase of 641 million from yearend 2019 primarily reflecting senior notes issuances net of repayments 1797 million credit facility borrowings net of repayments 900 million net cash provided by operating activities 1639 million and dispositions 260 million the following cash outflows partially offset these cash inflows commercial paper repayments net of borrowings 3190 million 

    

dividend payments 156 million purchase of treasury stock 150 million capital and technology expenditures 135 million other debt repayments net of borrowings 123 million and financing outflows for employee stockbased compensation withholding taxes 103 million 

cash from operations 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 46 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the net loss that we recorded in 2020 adjusted for noncash items due to covid19 partially offset by net cash inflows from our loyalty program including the onetime cash payments as a result of the amendments to our cobrand credit card agreements discussed in note 2 a cash benefit from working capital changes and lower cash paid for income taxes working capital changes primarily reflect lower accounts receivable due to lower fee and cost reimbursement revenues and a higher allowance for credit losses lower accounts payable due to lower purchasing activity and lower bonus accruals 

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 05 to 10 at both yearend 2020 and yearend 2019 we have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures including expenditures on technology of 135 million in 2020 and 653 million in 2019 capital expenditures in 2020 decreased by 518 million compared to 2019 primarily reflecting the net lower spending on owned and leased properties and our worldwide systems and the 2019 acquisitions of a us  canada property and elegant hotels group plc “elegant” 

we expect spending on capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately 575 million to 650 million for 2021 including contract acquisition costs equity and other investments loan advances and various capital expenditures including approximately 220 million for maintenance capital spending and our new headquarters 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations in the starwood combination we acquired various hotels and equity interests in various hotels many of which we have sold or are seeking to sell we have made and expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include property acquisitions and renovations such as our 2019 acquisitions of the w new york  union square and elegant new construction loans guarantees and noncontrolling equity investments over time we seek to minimize capital invested in our business through asset sales subject to longterm management or franchise agreements 

dispositions property and asset sales generated 260 million cash proceeds in 2020 and 395 million in 2019 see note 4 for more information on dispositions 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan advances net of loan collections amounted to 33 million in 2020 compared to net collections of 21 million in 2019 at yearend 2020 we had 163 million of senior mezzanine and other loans outstanding compared to 126 million outstanding at yearend 2019 

financing activities cash flows 

debt debt decreased by 564 million in 2020 to 10376 million at yearend 2020 from 10940 million at yearend 2019 see “sources of liquidity” caption in this “liquidity and capital resources” section and note 10 for additional information on the senior note and credit facility transactions in 2020

in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by entities in which we have an equity investment we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or the actions of the entity 

additionally in 2017 we granted a hotel owner a onetime right exercisable in 2022 to require us to purchase the leasehold interest in the land and hotel for 300 million in cash the “put option” if the owner exercises the put option we have the option to purchase at the same time the put transaction closes the fee simple interest in the underlying land for an additional 200 million in cash the “call option” we also have the right to defer the closing on the put and call options if exercised to december 2024 we account for the put option as a guarantee and as of december 31 2020 believe it is probable the hotel owner will exercise the put option and we will exercise the call option

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if 1 we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

while we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made actual results may differ significantly additionally changes in our assumptions estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

see note 2 for further information related to our critical accounting policies and estimates which are as follows 

loyalty program  including how we estimate the breakage of hotel points credit card points and free night certificates the volume of points and free night certificates that will be issued under our cobrand credit card agreements the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled under our cobrand credit card agreements and the standalone selling prices of goods and services provided under our cobrand credit card agreements

business combinations  including the assumptions that we make to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to discount rates royalty rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates stock prices currency exchange rates and debt prices we manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floatingrate notes receivable and floatingrate debt changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixedrate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt 

we are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investments in publicly traded companies changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment 

we use derivative instruments including cash flow hedges fair value hedges net investment in nonus operations hedges and other derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates as a matter of policy we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes see note 2 for more information on derivative instruments 

    

the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value as of yearend 2020 for our financial instruments that are impacted by market risks

terms of our management agreements vary but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a specified percentage of annual revenues that exceed a fixed amount many of our operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners many of our operating agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured those deficiencies in certain circumstances some of our management agreements allow owners to convert companyoperated properties to franchised properties under our brands 

for the lodging facilities we operate we generally are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs we provide centralized reservation services and advertising marketing and promotional services as well as various accounting and data processing services and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs 

franchised licensed and unconsolidated joint venture properties 

we have franchising licensing and joint venture programs that permit hotel owners and operators to use many of our lodging brand names and systems under our hotel franchising programs we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees which typically range from four to seven percent of room revenues for all brands plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain fullservice brands franchisees and certain joint ventures contribute to our marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems 

we also receive royalty fees under license agreements with marriott vacations worldwide corporation “mvw” our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011 and its affiliates for certain brands including marriott vacation club grand residences by marriott the ritzcarlton destination club westin sheraton and for certain existing properties st regis and the luxury collection we receive license fees from mvw consisting of a fixed annual fee adjusted for inflation plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes 

at yearend 2019  we had 5205 franchised and licensed properties  796042 rooms 

residential 

we use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate often in conjunction with hotel development and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others thirdparty owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk we have used or licensed our jw marriott the ritzcarlton ritzcarlton reserve w the luxury collection st regis edition bulgari marriott sheraton westin four points delta and autograph collection brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales 

seasonality 

in general business at companyoperated and franchised properties fluctuates moderately with the seasons and is relatively stable business at some resort properties may be more seasonal depending on location 

    

relationship with major customer 

we operate or franchise properties that are owned or leased by host hotels  resorts inc “host” in addition host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties that we operate under longterm management agreements see note 17 for more information 

intellectual property 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names trademarks service marks trade names and logos are very important to the sales and marketing of our properties and services we believe that our brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality care service and value to our customers guests and the traveling public accordingly we register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise protect against its unauthorized use

 other activities 

loyalty program  sales and marketing and reservation systems  on february 13 2019 we completed the integration of our three legacy loyalty programs  marriott rewards the ritzcarlton rewards and starwood preferred guest  under one name marriott bonvoy tm  members have access to marriott bonvoy’s diverse brand portfolio rich benefits and travel experiences we refer to marriott bonvoy throughout this report as our “ loyalty program ” 

our loyalty program rewards members with points toward free hotel stays access to travel experiences through our marriott bonvoy tours  activities program miles with participating airline programs and other benefits we believe that our loyalty program generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2019  over 50 percent of our room nights were booked by loyalty program members we strategically market to this large and growing guest base to generate revenue see the “ loyalty program ” caption in note 2 for more information 

marriottcom our international websites and our mobile apps continued to grow significantly in 2019 our web and mobile products allow for a seamless booking experience and easy enrollment in our loyalty program to book our exclusive member rates our look no further ® best rate guarantee ensures best rate integrity strengthening consumer confidence in our brand and gives guests greater access to the same rates when they book hotel rooms through our various direct channels we also continue to grow engagement levels with millions of guests through our digital guest services  checkin checkout service requests mobile key and more  across our hotel portfolio our digital strategy continues to focus on creating a simple and efficient digital booking experience while elevating the service experience through digital guest services and generating superior guest satisfaction and more memorable stays at our properties 

at yearend 2019  we operated 22 hotel reservation centers eight in the us and 14 in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own two of the us facilities and either lease the others or share space with a companyoperated property our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize thirdparty agents where cost effective economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and franchisees and enhance our fee revenue 

we believe our global sales and revenue management organizations are a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people processes and systems our aboveproperty sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around how the customer wants to buy reducing duplication of efforts by individual hotels and 

    

allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts we also utilize innovative and sophisticated revenue management systems many of which are proprietary which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increasing efficiency and producing higher propertylevel revenue for hotels in our portfolio most of the hotels in our portfolio utilize webbased programs to effectively manage the rate setup and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

credit card programs  we have multiyear agreements with jp morgan chase and american express for our usissued cobrand credit cards associated with our loyalty program  we also license credit card programs internationally including in canada the united kingdom united arab emirates and japan we earn fixed amounts that are generally payable at contract inception and variable amounts that are paid to us monthly over the term of the agreements primarily based on card usage and we believe that our cobrand credit cards contribute to the success of our loyalty program and reflect the quality and value of our portfolio of brands 

sustainability and social impact  guided by our 2025 sustainability and social impact goals as well as the united nations sustainable development goals we believe we have an opportunity to create a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business our sustainability and social impact platform serve 360 doing good in every direction is built around four focus areas nurture our world sustain responsible operations empower through opportunity and welcome all and advance human rights  each with targets to drive our efforts through 2025 these targets reflect our goals to protect and invest in the vitality of the communities and natural environments in which we operate build and operate sustainable hotels source responsibly advance human rights and mitigate climaterelated risk in 2019 we continued to implement programs designed to help reduce our carbon water and waste footprints with programming such as the switch from singleuse toiletry bottles to larger pumptopped bottles at many properties when implemented globally our expanded toiletry program is expected to help reduce our current amenity plastic usage by approximately 30 percent we also made significant progress toward our goal to train 100 of onproperty associates in human trafficking awareness by 2025 with over 675000 associates trained as of yearend 2019 these and other sustainability and social impact efforts help us to address the growing expectations of our stakeholders increase our operational efficiency and excellence and enhance our reputation while mitigating risk and supporting the continued growth and resiliency of our business 

global design division  our global design division provides design development refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts like thirdparty contractors global design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor according to lodging industry data in the us alone there are over 1800 lodging management companies including approximately 18 that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels operate hotels on behalf of thirdparty owners and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria 

we also compete for guests with large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model search engines such as google and bing and online services including airbnb and homeaway that allow travelers to book shortterm rentals of homes and apartments as an alternative to hotel rooms we compete against lodging operators franchisors and other competitors for guests in many areas including brand recognition and reputation location guest satisfaction room rates quality of service amenities quality of accommodations security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2019  approximately 72 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the owner pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system in the franchising business we face many competitors that have strong brands and guest appeal including hilton intercontinental hotels group hyatt wyndham accor choice radisson best western and others 

outside the us branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers decline international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the benefits of centralized reservation systems marketing programs and our loyalty program 

    

based on lodging industry data we have an approximately 16 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a four percent share of the hotel market outside the us we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong guest preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems our loyalty program and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to guest preference across all our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic refurbishment and replacement of furnishings fixtures and equipment these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

employee relations 

at yearend 2019  we had approximately 174000 employees approximately 22000 of whom were represented by labor unions in the united states the country with our most significant union representation these numbers do not include hotel personnel employed by our owners franchisees and management companies hired by our franchisees we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national regional state or provincial and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation and development of properties complies in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future 

internet address and company sec filings 

our primary internet address is marriottcom on the investor relations portion of our website marriottcominvestor we provide a link to our electronic filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” including our annual report on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we make all such filings available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing the information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the captions “business and overview” “ liquidity and capital resources ” and other statements throughout this annual report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statement the forwardlooking statements in this annual report speak only as of the date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether due to new information future developments or otherwise 

    

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that make an investment in our securities risky the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results cash flows liquidity and stock price in addition these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report or in other company communications these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully for guests with other hotel properties and home sharing or rental services we operate in markets that contain many competitors each of our hotel brands and our home rental offering competes with major hotel chains regional hotel chains independent hotels and home sharing and rental services across national and international venues our ability to remain competitive and attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty program  direct booking channels and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline further new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets 

economic downturns and other global national and regional conditions could impact our financial results and growth because we conduct our business on a global platform changes in global national or regional economies governmental policies including in areas such as trade travel immigration healthcare and related issues and geopolitical conditions impact our activities our business is impacted by decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions changes in energy prices and currency values political instability heightened travel security measures travel advisories disruptions in air travel and concerns over disease violence war or terrorism our performance could be materially affected if these conditions arise or extend longer than anticipated or in other circumstances that we are not able to predict or mitigate 

during the last recession when demand for hotel rooms declined significantly particularly in 2009 we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency and such cost controls could again become necessary if demand significantly declines our efforts to implement any such changes in a manner designed to maintain guest loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction may not be successful and our market share may suffer as a result 

in addition us government travel and travel associated with us government operations are a significant part of our business which can suffer due to us federal spending cuts government hiring restrictions or other spending limitations that may result from presidential or congressional action or inaction including for example a us federal government shutdown such as the partial shutdown that occurred in december 2018 and january 2019 

risks relating to our integration of starwood 

some of the anticipated benefits of combining starwood and marriott may still not be realized and challenges related to our integration efforts could have adverse effects on our business although we have achieved substantial benefits from the starwood combination we cannot assure you when or that we will be able to fully realize additional benefits that we anticipated when we decided to acquire starwood including enhancing revenues or achieving other operating efficiencies or cost savings we also cannot assure you that challenges we encountered with the harmonization of our systems our loyalty program and other business practices some of which still place a significant burden on our management and internal resources will not have significant adverse effects on our business or reputation 

program changes associated with our integration efforts could have a negative effect on guest preference or behavior our integration efforts involved significant changes to certain of our guest programs and services including our loyalty program  cobrand credit card arrangements and consumerfacing technology platforms and services while we believe such changes enhance these programs and services for our guests and will drive guest preference and satisfaction these changes remain subject to various uncertainties including whether the changes could be negatively perceived by certain guests and consumers could affect guest preference or could alter reservation spending or other guest or consumer behavior all of which could adversely affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

    

risks relating to our business 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which we fail or elect not to cure or in certain limited cases other negotiated contractual termination rights some courts have also applied agency law principles and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have interpreted hotel management agreements to be “personal services contracts” property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future when terminations occur for these or other reasons we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management or franchise agreement a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the us makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation more than a third of the rooms in our system are located outside of the us and its territories we expect that our international operations and resulting revenues will continue to grow this increasingly exposes us to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the us many of which are outside of our control and which could materially reduce our revenues or profits materially increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions significantly disrupt our business or significantly damage our reputation these challenges include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and government policies that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as competition laws cybersecurity and privacy laws currency regulations and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 4 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws 5 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism war pandemics or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 6 currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact the results and cash flows of our international operations 

any failure by our international operations to comply with anticorruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs reduce our profits limit our growth harm our reputation or subject us to broader liability we are subject to restrictions imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and anticorruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations such as the uk bribery act anticorruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain payments to government officials or other persons in order to influence official acts or decisions or to obtain or retain business these laws also require us to maintain adequate internal controls and accurate books and records we have properties in many parts of the world where corruption is common and our compliance with anticorruption laws may potentially conflict with local customs and practices the compliance programs internal controls and policies we maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws may not prevent our associates contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations we are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the us office of foreign assets control and the us department of commerce and authorities in other countries where we do business our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules the us or other countries may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected any violations of anticorruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties reduce our profits disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation or result in lawsuits or regulatory actions being brought against the company or its officers or directors in addition the operation of these laws or an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities or cease operations in certain countries that would otherwise support growth 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us accordingly fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues we are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our nonus business are generally reported in local currency which we then translate to us dollars for inclusion in our financial statements as a result changes between the 

    

foreign exchange rates and the us dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results we expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our nonus operations increases we enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in which we receive management and franchise fees but these efforts may not be successful these hedging agreements also do not cover all currencies in which we do business do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

some of our management agreements and related contracts require us to make payments to owners if the hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit some of our contracts with hotel owners require that we fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit we may not be able to recover any fundings of such performance guarantees which could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful we cannot assure you that new or newly acquired brands or any other new programs or products we have recently launched or may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other guests we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products or that those brands programs or products will be successful 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease violence and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues we have seen a decline in travel and reduced demand for lodging due to so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods volcanic activity wildfires and other natural disasters as well as manmade disasters and the spread of contagious diseases in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of guests and these circumstances could continue or worsen in the future to an extent and for durations that we are not able to predict actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest civil or geopolitical strife and other acts of violence could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for lodging limit the prices that we can obtain or increase our operating costs all of which could adversely affect our profits if a terrorist event or other incident of violence were to involve one or more of our branded properties demand for our properties in particular could suffer which could further hurt our revenues and profits 

disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or delay implementation of product or service initiatives consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product service or systems initiatives the timing and amount of capital investments and reimbursement for certain system initiatives and costs such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners franchisees and joint venture partners but we cannot always do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in an adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our company and our brands and any deterioration could adversely impact our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations certain events including those that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands many other factors also can influence our reputation and the value of our brands including service food quality and safety safety of our guests and associates availability and management of scarce natural resources supply chain management diversity human rights and support for local communities reputational value is also based on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us our brands and our hotels and it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or penalties or litigation negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including lost sales boycotts reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program  disruption of access to our websites and reservation systems loss of development opportunities or associate retention and recruiting difficulties any material decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our brands or corporate image could affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

if our brands goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record significant noncash charges to earnings as of december 31 2019  we had 177 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate 

    

impairment may have occurred estimated fair values of our brands or reporting units could change if for example there are changes in the business climate unanticipated changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in guests’ perception and the reputation of our brands or changes in interest rates operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

actions by our franchisees and licensees or others could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties for lodging timeshare residential and our credit card programs under the terms of their agreements with us these parties interact directly with guests and others under our brand and trade names if these third parties fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems including any data incident involving guest information or a circumstance involving guest or associate health or safety or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our agreements with these parties provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances it could be expensive or time consuming for us to pursue such remedies  we also cannot assure you that in every instance a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights or that we could collect any awarded damages from the defaulting party 

collective bargaining activity and strikes could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs and interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies  a significant number of associates at our managed leased and owned hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements if relationships with our organized associates or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we operate could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations as we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018  numerous collective bargaining agreements are typically subject to negotiation each year and our past ability to resolve such negotiations does not mean that we will resolve future negotiations without strikes disruptions or on terms that we consider reasonable labor disputes and disruptions have in the past and could in the future result in adverse publicity and adversely affect operations and revenues at affected hotels in addition labor disputes and disruptions could harm our relationship with our associates result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities harm our relationships with our guests and customers divert management attention and reduce customer demand for our services all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by our thirdparty property owners and franchisees increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates or if we lose the services of senior executives our business could suffer we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses a shortage of skilled labor could also result in higher wages that would increase our labor costs which could reduce our profits in addition the efforts and abilities of our senior executives are important elements of maintaining our competitive position and driving future growth and if we lose the services of one or more of our senior executives we could experience challenges executing our business strategies or other adverse effects on our business 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance or the cost of such insurance could increase we require comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed leased and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary we require managed hotel owners to procure such coverage or we procure such coverage on their behalf we also require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we our hotel owners or our franchisees can obtain or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of information systems may result in high deductibles low limits or may be uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance may be unacceptably high as a result we our hotel owners and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels or may not be successful in obtaining insurance at all for example in 2018 and 2019 substantial increases in property insurance costs occurred due to the severe and widespread 

    

damage caused by the 2017 atlantic hurricane season and other natural disasters coupled with continued large global losses in the property market in 2018 also due to the data security incident and the state of the cyber insurance market generally the costs for our cyber insurance increased for our policy period beginning in the 2019 third quarter and the cost of such insurance could continue to increase in future years further in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we our hotel owners or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result our revenues and profits could be adversely affected and for properties we own or lease we could lose some or all of the capital that we have invested in the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations 

development and financing risks 

while we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money to fund new hotel investments as well as to refurbish and improve existing hotels the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert little control obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable our growth strategy for adding lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements and franchise agreements for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy and rate changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and demand for construction resources 

our development and renovation activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks we occasionally develop or acquire and renovate hotel and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in 2014 and 2015 in connection with our development and construction of three edition hotels and residences our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 any future weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop or renovate could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays or cost overruns including those due to shortages or increased costs of skilled labor andor materials lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion 

our owned properties and other real estate investments subject us to numerous risks  we have a number of owned and leased properties which are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property we are actively pursuing sales of some of these properties but equity real estate investments can be difficult to sell quickly and we may not be able to do so at prices we find acceptable or at all moreover the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated if any by the related properties and the expenses incurred a variety of other factors also affect income from properties and real estate values including local market conditions and new supply of hotels availability and costs of staffing governmental regulations insurance zoning tax and eminent domain laws interest rate levels and the availability of financing for example new or existing real estate or tax laws can make it more expensive to acquire develop or operate andor expand modify or renovate hotels when interest rates increase the cost of acquiring developing expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases similarly as financing becomes less available it becomes more difficult 

    

both to acquire and to sell real property finally under eminent domain laws governments can take real property sometimes for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth despite our assetlight strategy our real estate properties could be impacted by any of these factors resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition if our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses including needed capital expenditures our income could be adversely affected or we could be required to record significant noncash impairment charges to our results of operations 

development and other investing activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes and may decrease our ability to manage risk we have from time to time invested and may continue to invest in partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties these investments generally include some form of shared control over the development of the asset or operations of the business and create added risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours could take action without our approval or conversely prevent us from taking action without our partner’s approval or could make requests contrary to our policies or objectives should a venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partner’s share of the venture’s liabilities actions by a coventurer might subject the assets owned by the venture or partnership to additional risk such as increased project costs project delays or operational difficulties following project completion disagreements with our venture partners may result in litigation these risks may be more likely to occur in difficult business environments we cannot assure you that our investments through partnerships or joint ventures will be successful in light of these risks 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits we participate through licensing agreements or directly or through noncontrolling interests in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under many of our luxury and premium brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including risks that 1 weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future development partners of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or the tax benefits of mortgage financing or residential ownership generally or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims or claims related to purchaser deposits and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

some hotel openings in our development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels which could adversely affect our growth prospects we report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline including hotels under construction and under signed contracts as well as hotels approved for development but not yet under contract the eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and in particular the approved hotels that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals increased construction costs changes in lodging supply dynamics in individual markets or disruptive conditions in global regional or local markets we have seen construction timelines for pipeline hotels lengthen due to competition for skilled construction labor and disruption in the supply chain for materials and these circumstances could continue or worsen in the future accordingly we cannot assure you that all of our development pipeline will result in new hotels entering our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties impact our profits at times we make loans for hotel development acquisition or renovation expenditures when we enter into or amend management or franchise agreements from time to time we also provide thirdparty lenders with financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings we could suffer losses if hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded 

if owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed the owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced if those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all the lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property such sales or repossessions could in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows which could negatively affect our results of operations 

    

changes affecting the availability of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may have consequences that we cannot yet reasonably predict we are a party to various agreements and other instruments where obligations by or to us are calculated based on or otherwise dependent on libor in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after 2021 as a result libor may perform differently than in the past and may ultimately cease to be utilized or to exist either before or after 2021 alternative benchmark rates may replace libor and could affect our agreements that rely on libor not all of which contain alternative rate provisions we are still in the process of investigating which of our agreements rely on libor and at this time it is not possible for us to predict the effect of any changes to libor any phase out of libor or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates there is uncertainty about how we the financial markets applicable law and the courts will address the replacement of libor with alternative rates on contracts that do not include alternative rate provisions in addition any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds our receipts or payments under agreements that rely on libor and the valuation of derivative or other contracts to which we are a party any of which could impact our results of operations and cash flows 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management property management human resources and payroll systems our loyalty program  and technologies we make available to our guests and for our associates these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and our business could suffer if we cannot do that as quickly or effectively as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  pricelinecom ®  bookingcom™ travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although our best rate guarantee and member rate programs have helped limit guest preference shift to intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract guests including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  yahoo ®  and baidu ® to steer guests toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court our business and profitability could be harmed to the extent that online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from our direct online channels or through their fees increase the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels in addition if we are not able to negotiate new agreements on satisfactory terms when our existing contracts with intermediaries which generally have 2 to 3 year terms come up for renewal our business and prospects could be negatively impacted in a number of ways for example if newly negotiated agreements are on terms less favorable to our hotels than the expiring agreements or if we are not able to negotiate new agreements and our hotels no longer appear on intermediary websites our bookings could decline our profits and the operating profits of hotels in our system could decline and customers and owners may be less attracted to our brands we may not be able to recapture or offset any such loss of business through actions we take to enhance our direct marketing and reservation channels or to rely on other channels or other intermediary websites 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of company associate and guest data in the operation of our business we collect store use and transmit large volumes of data regarding associates guests customers owners licensees franchisees and our own business operations including credit card numbers reservation and loyalty data and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in systems maintained by third parties including our owners franchisees licensees and service providers the integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business if this data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions 

our guests and associates also have a high expectation that we as well as our owners franchisees licensees and service providers will adequately protect and appropriately use their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by laws and governmental regulation our contractual obligations and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding in the us the european union asia and other jurisdictions where we operate our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners franchisees licensees and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing legal and regulatory requirements and associate and guest expectations or may require significant additional investments or time to do so we may incur significant additional costs to meet these requirements obligations and 

    

expectations and in the event of alleged or actual noncompliance we may experience increased operating costs increased exposure to fines and litigation and increased risk of damage to our reputation and brand 

the data security incident could have numerous adverse effects on our business as a result of the data security incident we are a party to numerous lawsuits primarily putative class actions brought by consumers and others in the us and canada one securities class action lawsuit in the us and three shareholder derivative lawsuits in the us we may be named as a party in additional lawsuits and other claims may be asserted by or on behalf of guests customers hotel owners shareholders or others seeking monetary damages or other relief a number of federal state and foreign governmental authorities have also made inquiries opened investigations or requested information andor documents related to the data security incident including under various data protection and privacy regulations such as the european union’s general data protection regulation responding to and resolving these lawsuits claims and investigations could result in material remedial and other expenses which may not be covered by insurance including any fines imposed by the information commissioner’s office in the united kingdom the “ico” as discussed in note 7  or by regulatory authorities in various other jurisdictions governmental authorities investigating the data security incident also may seek to impose undertakings injunctive relief consent decrees or other civil or criminal penalties which could among other things materially increase our data security costs or otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business significant management time and company resources have been and may continue to be devoted to the data security incident future publicity or developments related to the data security incident including as a result of subsequent reports or regulatory actions or developments could have a range of other adverse effects on our business or prospects including causing or contributing to loss of consumer confidence reduced consumer demand reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program  loss of development opportunities and associate retention and recruiting difficulties insurance coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data security incident may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses including the final amount of the proposed ico fine and any other fines or penalties related to the data security incident 

additional cybersecurity incidents could have adverse effects on our business we have implemented security measures to safeguard our systems and data and we intend to continue implementing additional measures in the future but as we have seen in the past our measures may not be sufficient to maintain the confidentiality security or availability of the data we collect store and use to operate our business measures taken by our service providers or our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or their service providers also may not be sufficient efforts to hack or circumvent security measures efforts to gain unauthorized access to exploit or disrupt the operation or integrity of our data or systems failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses “ransomware” or other malware “phishing” or other types of business communications compromises operator error or inadvertent releases of data have impacted and may in the future impact our information systems and records or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by third parties to gain unauthorized access or prevent authorized access to such systems have greatly increased in recent years we have experienced cyberattacks attempts to disrupt access to our systems and data and attempts to affect the operation or integrity of our data or systems and the frequency and sophistication of such efforts could continue to increase any significant theft of unauthorized access to compromise or loss of loss of access to or fraudulent use of guest associate owner franchisee licensee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in legal regulatory and other consequences including remedial and other expenses fines or litigation depending on the nature and scope of the event compromises in the security of our information systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers or other disruptions or compromises of data or systems could lead to an interruption in or other adverse effects on the operation of our systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees other business partners or service providers resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits and could result in negative publicity and other adverse effects on our business including lost sales loss of consumer confidence boycotts reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program  litigation loss of development opportunities or associate satisfaction retention and recruiting difficulties all of which could materially affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

because we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past additional incidents or the failure to detect and appropriately respond to additional incidents could magnify the severity of the adverse effects on our business the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage information systems change frequently can be difficult to detect for long periods of time and can involve difficult or prolonged assessment or remediation periods even once detected which could also magnify the severity of these adverse effects we cannot assure you that all potential causes of the data security incident have been identified and remediated and will not occur again additional measures may be needed to prevent a similar incident in the future and such measures may not be sufficient to prevent other types of incidents although we carry cyber insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all expenses or other losses including fines or all types of claims that may arise in connection with 

    

cyberattacks security compromises and other related incidents furthermore in the future such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

changes in privacy and data security laws could increase our operating costs increase our exposure to fines and litigation and adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively we are subject to numerous complex and frequently changing laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information including in the us the european union asia and other jurisdictions nonus data privacy and data security laws various us federal and state laws such as the california consumer privacy act and the new york shield act payment card industry security standards and other information privacy and security standards are all applicable to us significant legislative or regulatory changes could be adopted in the future including in reaction to the data security incident or data breaches experienced by other companies compliance with changes in applicable data privacy laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act and the new york shield act and contractual obligations including responding to investigations into our compliance may restrict our business operations increase our operating costs increase our exposure to fines and litigation in the event of alleged noncompliance and adversely affect our reputation following the data security incident the ico and certain other regulators also opened investigations into our privacy practices including the representations in our privacy policies and how we handle individual rights requests as a result of these investigations we could be exposed to significant fines and remediation costs in addition to any imposed as a result of the data security incident and adverse publicity related to the investigations could adversely affect our reputation 

additionally we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws such as the california consumer privacy act and the new york shield act or new federal or state laws on marketing and solicitation or international privacy eprivacy and antispam laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential guests and customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were to be prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new guests and customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

any disruption in the functioning of our reservation systems could adversely affect our performance and results we manage global reservation systems that communicate reservations to our hotels from individuals who book reservations directly with us online through our mobile apps through our telephone call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed accuracy and efficiency of our reservation systems are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands our business may suffer if we fail to maintain upgrade or prevent disruption to our reservation systems disruptions in or changes to our reservation systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data 

other risks 

ineffective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements reduce investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price  as discussed in part ii item 8 “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” later in this report in the 2018 fourth quarter we identified a material weakness in internal control related to our accounting for our loyalty program  which resulted in errors in our previously issued financial statements for the 2018 first second and third quarters internal controls related to the implementation of asu 201409 and the accounting for our loyalty program are important to accurately reflect our financial position and results of operations in our financial reports we are in the process of remediating the material weakness and have responded to requests from the sec for documents and information related to these matters if the additional controls and processes that we have implemented while we work to remediate the material weakness are not sufficient or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses our ability to accurately record process and report financial information and consequently our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected failure to properly remediate the material weakness or the discovery of additional control deficiencies could result in violations of applicable securities laws stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements subject us to litigation and investigations negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets 

    

changes in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world including those for financial reporting taxes healthcare cybersecurity privacy climate change and the environment changes to such laws regulations or policies could reduce our profits we also anticipate that many of the jurisdictions where we do business will continue to review taxes and other revenue raising measures and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices or reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could significantly impact us and other modifications could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our operations or could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured 

we could be subject to additional tax liabilities we are subject to a variety of taxes in the us federal state and local and numerous foreign jurisdictions we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions 

our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example the legislation known as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “ 2017 tax act ” requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 tax act  significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the us internal revenue service and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts under the delaware business combination statute a shareholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the shareholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without shareholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a shareholder rights plan

business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotel residential and timeshare properties in 134 countries and territories under 30 brand names under our assetlight business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them we discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments north american fullservice  north american limitedservice  and asia pacific  our europe middle east and africa and caribbean and latin america operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments  in january 2020 we modified our reportable segment structure as a result of a change in the way management intends to evaluate results and allocate resources within the company beginning with the first quarter of 2020 we will present the following reportable business segments north america  asia pacific  and europe middle east and africa  our caribbean and latin america operating segment will be included in a combined caribbean and latin america and “unallocated corporate” caption 

we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us in most markets base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue or certain propertylevel revenue in the case of franchise fees while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return in our middle east and africa and asia pacific regions incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit also referred to as “house profit” which we discuss under the “performance measures” section below less noncontrollable expenses such as property insurance real estate taxes and capital spending reserves 

our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while adding new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling our investments maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility 

we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control costs both at companyoperated properties and at the corporate level “aboveproperty” we provide our guests new and memorable experiences through our portfolio of brands innovative technology personalized guest recognition and access to travel experiences through our marriott bonvoy tours  activities program our brands remain strong due to our skilled management teams dedicated associates superior guest service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction significant distribution loyalty program  multichannel reservation systems and desirable property amenities we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution we believe that our loyalty program generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels and we strategically market to the program’s large and growing member base to generate revenue 

    

we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities technology offerings and guest experiences we address through various means hotels in our system that do not meet our standards we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse websites and of our associated mobile applications through functionality and service improvements 

our profitability as well as that of owners and franchisees has benefited from our approach to propertylevel and aboveproperty productivity managed properties in our system continue to maintain tight cost controls we also control aboveproperty costs some of which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas 

data security incident 

on november 30 2018 we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the starwood reservations database the starwood reservations database is no longer used for business operations 

to date we have not seen a meaningful impact on demand as a result of the data security incident 

in july 2019 the ico issued a formal notice of intent under the uk data protection act 2018 proposing a fine in the amount of £99 million against the company in relation to the data security incident the “proposed ico fine” we mutually agreed with the ico to an extension of the regulatory process until june 1 2020 and the ico proceeding is ongoing in the 2019 second quarter we recorded an accrual in the full amount of the proposed ico fine for this loss contingency and in the 2019 fourth quarter we reduced the accrual to 65 million based on the ongoing proceeding see note 7 for additional information 

we are currently unable to estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the company from the data security incident in excess of the expenses already incurred however we do not believe this incident will impact our longterm financial health although our insurance program includes coverage designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data security incident that insurance may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses including fines and penalties related to the data security incident as we expected the cost of such insurance increased for our current policy period and the cost of such insurance could continue to increase in future years we expect to incur significant expenses associated with the data security incident in future periods primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations including possible fines and penalties increased expenses and capital investments for information technology and information security and data privacy and increased expenses for compliance activities and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements see note 7 for information related to expenses incurred in 2018 and 2019 insurance recoveries and legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the data security incident 

performance measures 

we believe revpar which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which are components of calculating revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we define our comparable properties as our properties that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year since january 1 2018 for the current period and have not in either the current or previous year i undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions ii been converted between companyoperated and franchised or iii sustained substantial property damage or business interruption for 2019 compared to 2018  we had 4371 comparable north american properties and 1232 comparable international properties for 2018 compared to 2017  we had 4109 comparable north american properties and 1173 comparable international properties 

we also believe companyoperated house profit margin which is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit to total propertylevel revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing 

    

expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

business trends 

our 2019 fullyear results reflected a yearoveryear increase in the number of properties in our system strong demand for our brands in many markets around the world and generally favorable economic conditions comparable worldwide systemwide revpar for 2019 increased 13 percent to 11730  adr increased 08 percent on a constant dollar basis to 16055  and occupancy increased 04 percentage points to 731 percent  compared to 2018  

in north america revpar increased modestly in 2019  driven by higher adr partially constrained by new lodging supply in certain markets in our asia pacific segment in 2019 revpar growth was driven by india and major urban markets in greater china but was partially constrained by lower demand in hong kong our europe region experienced higher demand in 2019 led by strong demand from us travelers in the uk italy and spain in our middle east and africa region revpar remained relatively stable in 2019 due to revpar growth in africa partially offset by ongoing geopolitical and economic instability and supply growth in the middle east revpar grew across our caribbean and latin america region driven by higher adr partially constrained by lower demand in mexico 

for our companyoperated properties we continue to focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins and making productivity improvements north american companyoperated house profit margins decreased by 20 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018 at comparable properties primarily due to wage increases and modest revpar growth partially offset by cost controls and synergy savings from the starwood combination international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 20 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018 at comparable properties primarily due to revpar growth in our asia pacific segment and europe region and cost controls and synergy savings from the starwood combination 

the coronavirus outbreak currently is impacting our operations in china and other parts of our asia pacific segment by necessitating the closure of numerous hotels in mainland china and significantly reducing demand in greater china and certain other asia pacific markets we cannot presently estimate the overall operational and financial impact which could be material to our 2020 results and which is highly dependent on the breadth and duration of the outbreak and could be affected by other factors we are not currently able to predict 

system growth and pipeline 

in 2019  we added 516 properties with 78142 rooms around the world across our portfolio of brands approximately 44 percent of added rooms are located outside north america and 18 percent are conversions from competitor brands in 2019  70 properties  11908 rooms exited our system 

at yearend 2019  our development pipeline grew to a record 515000 rooms with more than half located outside of north america the pipeline includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts and approximately 23000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts in 2019 we signed management and franchise agreements for 815 properties 136000 rooms setting company records for rooms signings in asia pacific europe caribbean and latin america and middle east and africa contracts signed in 2019 also reflected the company’s strength in the luxury tier with 42 properties signed across 27 countries and territories 

in 2020  we expect the number of our open hotel rooms will increase at a rate consistent with our recent experience this growth expectation does not include any potential impact related to the coronavirus outbreak 

    

properties and rooms 

at yearend 2019  we operated franchised and licensed the following properties and rooms

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2019  2018  and 2017  

our 2017 results were favorably impacted by the nonrecurring gain on the disposition of our ownership interest in avendra discussed in note 3  we committed to the owners of the hotels in our system that the benefits derived from avendra including any dividends or sale proceeds above our original investment would be used for the benefit of the hotels in our system accordingly in 2019 we used 118 million 87 million aftertax and in 2018 we used 115 million 85 million aftertax of the net proceeds and we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for the benefit of our system of hotels spending under those plans is and will be expensed in the “reimbursed expenses” caption of our income statements causing a reduction in our profitability in the periods it is expensed

cost reimbursements 



cost reimbursement revenue net of reimbursed expenses varies due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized programs and services and the related reimbursements we receive from hotel owners and franchisees over the long term our centralized programs and services are not designed to impact our economics either positively or negatively 

2019 compared to 2018 

cost reimbursement revenue net of reimbursed expenses decreased 605 million  primarily due to lower loyalty program revenues net of expenses 

2018 compared to 2017

2018 compared to 2017 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 6 million  primarily due to 51 million of companyfunded supplemental retirement savings plan contributions in 2018 and 20 million of higher professional fees partially offset by administrative cost savings largely due to synergies associated with the starwood combination companyfunded supplemental retirement savings plan contributions represent an additional onetime contribution of up to 1000 per eligible associate

interest expense increased by 54 million  primarily due to higher interest on senior note issuances net of maturities

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facility 

in the 2019 second quarter we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement the “credit facility” to extend the maturity date of the credit facility and increase the aggregate amount of available borrowings to up to 45 billion  the available borrowings support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating while any outstanding commercial paper borrowings andor borrowings under our credit facility generally have shortterm maturities we classify the outstanding borrowings as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a longterm basis the credit facility expires on june 28 2024 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 the credit facility defines ebitda as net income less cost reimbursement revenue plus reimbursed expenses plus the sum of interest expense income taxes depreciation amortization nonrecurring noncash charges and extraordinary nonrecurring or unusual cash charges expenses or losses up to a certain amount 

    

our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations remain adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

we issue commercial paper in the us we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2019  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1522 million and reflected borrowing capacity of 1297 million under our credit facility and our cash balance of 225 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 45 billion of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting 3203 million of outstanding commercial paper there being no outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans and fund our liquidity needs we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings issuances of senior notes and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations but which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

cash from operations 

cash from operations for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



the 672 million decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to lower operating income largely due to timing differences between the costs incurred for centralized programs and services including our loyalty program and the related reimbursements we received from hotel owners and franchisees in 2019 as well as changes in working capital 

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 05 to 10 at yearend 2019 and 04 to 10 at yearend 2018  we have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 653 million in 2019  556 million in 2018  and 240 million in 2017  capital expenditures in 2019 increased by 97 million compared to 2018  primarily reflecting the 2019 acquisitions of w new york  union square and elegant and net higher spending on several owned and leased properties partially offset by the 2018 acquisition of the sheraton phoenix downtown capital expenditures in 2018 increased by 316 million compared to 2017  primarily reflecting the 2018 acquisition of the sheraton phoenix downtown improvements to our worldwide systems and net higher spending on several owned properties 

we expect spending on capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately 700 million to 800 million for 2020  including contract acquisition costs equity and other investments loan advances and various capital expenditures including approximately 200 million for maintenance capital spending 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations in the starwood combination we acquired various hotels and joint venture interests in various hotels many of which we have sold or are seeking to sell we have made and expect to continue making selective and 

    

opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include property acquisitions and renovations such as our 2018 acquisition of the sheraton phoenix downtown and our 2019 acquisitions of the w new york  union square and elegant new construction loans guarantees and noncontrolling equity investments over time we seek to minimize capital invested in our business through asset sales subject to longterm management or franchise agreements 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because 1 we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated 395 million cash proceeds in 2019 and 479 million in 2018  see note 3 for more information on dispositions 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan collections net of loan advances amounted to 21 million in 2019  compared to net collections of 35 million in 2018  at yearend 2019  we had 126 million of senior mezzanine and other loans outstanding compared to 131 million outstanding at yearend 2018  

equity method investments cash outflows of 23 million in 2019  72 million in 2018  and 62 million in 2017 for equity method investments primarily reflect our investments in several joint ventures 

financing activities cash flows 

debt debt increased by 1593 million in 2019  to 10940 million at yearend 2019 from 9347 million at yearend 2018  primarily due to the issuance of our series bb cc and dd notes and higher outstanding commercial paper borrowings 951 million partially offset by the maturity of our series k notes 600 million and series t notes 181 million see note 9 for additional information on the debt issuances

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if 1 we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

while we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made actual results may differ significantly additionally changes in our assumptions estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

see note 2 for further information related to our critical accounting policies and estimates which are as follows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates stock prices currency exchange rates and debt prices we manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floatingrate notes receivable and floatingrate debt changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixedrate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt 

we are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment 

we use derivative instruments including cash flow hedges net investment in nonus operations hedges and other derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates as a matter of policy we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes see note 2 for more information on derivative instruments

controls and procedures 

tableend disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report we evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of those controls and procedures which by their nature can provide only reasonable assurance about management’s control objectives you should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote based upon this evaluation our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below in light of the material weakness management performed additional procedures to validate the accuracy and completeness of the financial results impacted by the control deficiencies such procedures included the validation of data underlying key financial models substantive logic inspection fluctuation analyses and detailed testing 

material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

a material weakness as defined in rule 12b2 under the exchange act is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

as we reported in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 in the 2018 fourth quarter we identified the following deficiencies in the design of internal control over financial reporting for our loyalty program 

 these control deficiencies resulted in errors in the calculation of cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses in our previously issued financial statements for the 2018 first second and third quarters although the errors were not material to those financial statements we concluded that the combination of control deficiencies represented a material weakness ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has independently assessed our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included in part ii item 8 of this report 

remediation of material weakness 

we are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated as soon as possible we have made progress towards remediation and continue to implement our remediation plan for the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above which includes steps to increase dedicated personnel improve reporting processes design and implement new controls and enhance related supporting technology we will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that the controls are operating effectively 

internal control over financial reporting 

we have set forth management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and we incorporate those reports here by reference 

as outlined above we are in the process of taking steps to remediate the material weakness we made no other changes in internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2019 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

corporate structure and business 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotel residential and timeshare properties under numerous brand names at different price and service points consistent with our focus on management franchising and licensing we own very few of our lodging properties we were organized as a corporation in delaware in 1997 and became a public company in 1998 when we were “spun off” as a separate entity by the company formerly named “marriott international inc” 

we believe that our portfolio of brands shown in the following table is the largest and most compelling range of brands and properties of any lodging company in the world 

we discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments north american fullservice  north american limitedservice  and asia pacific  our europe middle east and africa and caribbean and latin america operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments  

acquisition of starwood hotels  resorts worldwide 

on september 23 2016 the “merger date” we completed the acquisition of starwood hotels  resorts worldwide llc formerly known as starwood hotels  resorts worldwide inc “starwood” through a series of transactions the “starwood combination” after which starwood became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of marriott our financial statements and related discussions in this report include starwood’s results of operations only from the merger date through yearend 2018  and reflect the financial position of our combined company at december 31 2018  and 2017 except where we specifically state otherwise such as certain statistics described under the caption “ performance measures ” in part ii item 7 we refer to our business associated with brands that were in our portfolio before the starwood combination as “legacymarriott” and to the starwood business and brands that we acquired as “legacystarwood” see footnote 3 dispositions and acquisitions  for more information

companyoperated properties 

at yearend 2018  we had 2020  companyoperated properties  566759  rooms which included properties under longterm management or lease agreements with property owners management and lease agreements together the “operating agreements” properties that we own and home and condominium communities for which we manage the related owners’ associations 

terms of our management agreements vary but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a specified percentage of annual revenues that exceed a fixed amount many of our operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners many of our operating agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured those deficiencies in certain circumstances some of our management agreements allow owners to convert companyoperated properties to franchised properties under our brands 

for the lodging facilities we operate we generally are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs we provide centralized reservation services and advertising marketing and promotional services as well as various accounting and data processing services and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs 

franchised licensed and unconsolidated joint venture properties 

we have franchising licensing and joint venture programs that permit hotel owners and operators and marriott vacations worldwide corporation “mvw” our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011 to use many of our lodging brand names and systems under our hotel franchising programs we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees which typically range from four to six percent of room revenues for all brands plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain fullservice hotels we are a partner in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage and in some cases own hotels some of these joint ventures also provide services to franchised hotels we recognize our share of these joint ventures’ net income or loss in the “ equity in earnings ” caption of our income statements franchisees and certain joint ventures contribute to our marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems 

we also receive royalty fees under license agreements with mvw and its affiliates for certain brands including marriott vacation club grand residences by marriott the ritzcarlton destination club westin sheraton and for certain existing properties st regis and the luxury collection we receive license fees from mvw consisting of a fixed annual fee adjusted for inflation plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes 

at yearend 2018  we had 4735  franchised and licensed properties  729413  rooms and 151  unconsolidated joint venture properties  21196  rooms 

residential 

we use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate often in conjunction with hotel development and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others thirdparty owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk we have used or licensed our jw marriott the ritzcarlton ritzcarlton reserve w the luxury collection st regis edition bulgari marriott sheraton westin four points delta and autograph collection  brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales while the worldwide residential market is very large we believe the luxurious nature of our residential properties the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands and the hospitality services that we provide all serve to make residential properties bearing our trademarks distinctive 

seasonality 

in general business at companyoperated and franchised properties fluctuates only moderately with the seasons and is relatively stable business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location 

relationship with major customer 

we operate or franchise properties that are owned or leased by host hotels  resorts inc “host” in addition host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties that we operate under longterm management agreements see footnote 19 relationship with major customer  for more information

intellectual property 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names trademarks service marks trade names and logos are very important to the sales and marketing of our properties and services we believe that our brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality care service and value to our customers guests and the traveling public accordingly we register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise protect against its unauthorized use 

brand portfolio 

we believe that our brand portfolio offers the largest and most compelling range of brands and properties in hospitality with two overall styles of hotels  classic offering timehonored hospitality for the modern traveler and distinctive offering memorable experiences with a unique perspective  each of which we group into three quality tiers luxury premium and select

 other activities 

loyalty program  sales and marketing and reservation systems  on august 18 2018 marriott launched one loyalty program with unified benefits under its three legacy loyalty brands — marriott rewards the ritzcarlton rewards and starwood preferred guest “spg” on february 13 2019 the combined program completed its integration under one name marriott bonvoy tm  members have access to marriott bonvoy’s diverse brand portfolio rich benefits and travel experiences we refer to marriott bonvoy throughout this report as our “ loyalty program ” 

our loyalty program  is a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts it rewards members with points toward free hotel stays experiences and other benefits or miles with participating airline programs we believe that our loyalty program generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2018  loyalty program  members purchased approximately 50 percent of our room nights we continually enhance our loyalty program  offerings and strategically market to this large and growing guest base to generate revenue see the “ loyalty program ” caption in footnote 2 summary of significant accounting policies  for more information 

marriottcom our international website and our mobile apps continued to grow significantly in 2018 our web and mobile platforms allow for a seamless booking experience and easy enrollment in our loyalty program  to book our exclusive member rates our look no further ®  best rate guarantee ensures best rate integrity strengthening consumer confidence in our brand and gives guests greater access to the same rates when they book hotel rooms through our various direct channels we also continue to grow engagement levels with millions of guests through our mobile guest services  checkin checkout service requests mobile key and more  across our hotel portfolio in 2018 we significantly expanded the number of hotels across our portfolio that offer mobile key enabling guests to use their mobile devices as a keycard for room entry and amenity access we also expanded our mobile food ordering at selected properties enabling guests to order food and beverages ondemand from hotel outlets our digital strategy continues to focus on creating a simple and efficient digital booking experience while elevating the service experience through mobile guest services and generating superior guest satisfaction and more memorable stays at our properties 

at yearend 2018  we operated 22  hotel reservation centers eight  in the us and 14  in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own two  of the us facilities and either lease the others or share space with a companyoperated property while pricing is set by our hotels our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and franchisees and enhance our fee revenue 

 7 

we believe our global sales and revenue management organizations are a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people processes and systems our aboveproperty sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around how the customer wants to buy reducing duplication of efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts we also utilize innovative and sophisticated revenue management systems many of which are proprietary which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increasing efficiency and producing higher propertylevel revenue for hotels in our portfolio most of the hotels in our portfolio utilize webbased programs to effectively manage the rate setup and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

as we further discuss in part i item 1a “risk factors” later in this report we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation revenue management and property management systems in our loyalty program  and in other aspects of our business we also make certain technologies available to our guests keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position furthermore the integrity and protection of customer guest employee and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency 

credit card programs    we have multiyear agreements with jp morgan chase and american express for our usissued cobrand credit cards associated with our loyalty program  we also license credit card programs in canada the united kingdom united arab emirates and japan we earn license fees based on card usage and we believe that our cobrand credit cards contribute to the success of our loyalty program  and reflect the quality and value of our portfolio of brands 

sustainability and social impact  guided by our 2025 sustainability and social impact goals as well as the united nations sustainable development goals we believe we have an opportunity to create a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business our sustainability and social impact platform serve 360 doing good in every direction is built around four focus areas nurture our world sustain responsible operations empower through opportunity and welcome all and advance human rights within each of these areas we have identified a series of 2025 goals that we believe will help us to address the expectations of our stakeholders increase our operational efficiency and excellence and enhance our reputation while supporting the continued growth and resiliency of our business examples of these goals include commitments to volunteerism building sustainably and striving to source responsibly while reducing carbon water and waste footprints investing in our communities and advancing human rights 

global design division  our global design division provides design development refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts like thirdparty contractors global design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor according to lodging industry data there are over 1400 lodging management companies in the us including approximately 21 that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels operate hotels on behalf of thirdparty owners and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria 

we also compete for guests with large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model search engines such as google and bing and online services including airbnb and homeaway that allow travelers to book shortterm rentals of homes and apartments as an alternative to hotel rooms we compete against lodging operators and other competitors for guests in many areas including brand recognition and reputation location guest satisfaction room rates quality of service amenities quality of accommodations security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program  points 

during the last recession demand for hotel rooms declined significantly particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally have improved since 2009 cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain guest loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2018  approximately 71 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the owner pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system in the franchising business we face many competitors that have strong 

 8 

brands and guest appeal including hilton intercontinental hotels group hyatt wyndham accor choice radisson best western and others 

outside the us branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers decline international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have an approximately   15 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a four percent share of the hotel market outside the us we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong guest preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to guest preference across all our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic refurbishment and replacement of furnishings fixtures and equipment these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

employee relations 

at yearend 2018  we had approximately 176000 employees approximately 22000 of whom were represented by labor unions these numbers do not include hotel personnel employed by our owners franchisees and management companies hired by our franchisees although we experienced labor disruptions in certain us markets in 2018 in connection with our contract negotiations with unions representing certain of our organized associates in those markets those contract negotiations and labor disruptions have been resolved and we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national regional state or provincial and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation and development of properties complies in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties and home and apartment sharing services for guests  we operate in markets that contain many competitors each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains and home and apartment sharing services in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty program  direct booking channels and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline further new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets 

economic downturns could impact our financial results and growth  weak economic conditions in one or more parts of the world changes in oil prices and currency values disruptions in national regional or global economies generally and the travel business in particular that might result from changing governmental policies in areas such as trade travel immigration healthcare and related issues political instability in some areas and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions could continue could have a negative impact on the lodging industry because of such uncertainty we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if economic or these other conditions worsen us government travel and travel associated with us government operations are also a significant part of our business and this aspect of our business has suffered and could in the future suffer due to us federal spending cuts or government hiring restrictions and any further limitations that may result from presidential or congressional action or inaction including for example a us federal government shutdown such as the partial shutdown that occurred in december 2018 and january 2019 

risks relating to our integration of starwood 

the continued diversion of resources and management’s attention to the integration of starwood could still adversely affect our daytoday business  while the integration of starwood is largely complete integration related matters still place a significant burden on our management and internal resources and may continue to do so for some time which could have adverse effects on our business or financial results 

some of the anticipated benefits of combining starwood and marriott may still not be realized we decided to acquire starwood with the expectation that the starwood combination would result in various benefits although we have already achieved substantial benefits others remain subject to several uncertainties including whether we can achieve certain revenue synergies 

integration could also involve unexpected costs disruptions of each legacy company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems could adversely affect the combined company we have encountered challenges in harmonizing our different reservations and other systems our loyalty program  and other business practices and we may encounter additional or increased challenges related to integration because of these or other factors we cannot assure you when or that we will be able to fully realize additional benefits from the starwood combination in the form of enhancing revenues or achieving other operating efficiencies cost savings or benefits or that challenges encountered with our harmonization efforts will not have adverse effects on our business or reputation 

program changes associated with our integration efforts could have a negative effect on guest preference or behavior  our integration efforts involved significant changes to certain of our guest programs and services including our loyalty program  cobranded credit card arrangements and consumerfacing technology platforms and services while we believe such changes enhance these programs and services for our guests and will drive guest preference and satisfaction these changes remain subject to various uncertainties including whether the changes could be negatively perceived by certain guests and consumers could affect guest preference or could alter reservation spending or other guest or consumer behavior all of which could adversely affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations

risks relating to our business 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which we fail or elect not to cure some courts have also applied agency law principles and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have interpreted hotel management agreements to be “personal services contracts” property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future if terminations occur for these or other reasons we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management or franchise agreement a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

our lodging operations are subject to global national and regional conditions  because we conduct our business on a global platform changes in global and regional economies and governmental policies impact our activities in recent years decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures resulting from the threat of further terrorism have hurt our business our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic and political environment in each of our operating regions the resulting unknown pace of both business and leisure travel and any future incidents or changes in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the us makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation   more than a third of the rooms in our system are located outside of the us and its territories we expect that our international operations and resulting revenues will continue to grow this increasingly exposes us to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the us many of which are outside of our control and which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions disrupt our business or damage our reputation these challenges include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and government policies that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as competition laws cybersecurity and privacy laws currency regulations and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 4 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws 5 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 6 currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact the results and cash flows of our international operations 

any failure by our international operations to comply with anticorruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs reduce our profits limit our growth harm our reputation or subject us to broader liability we are subject to restrictions imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and anticorruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations such as the uk bribery act anticorruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons to receive or retain business these laws also require us to maintain adequate internal controls and accurate books and records we have properties in many parts of the world where corruption is common and our compliance with anticorruption laws may potentially conflict with local customs and practices the compliance programs internal controls and policies we maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws may not prevent our associates contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations we are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and the us department of commerce our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules the us may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected any violations of anticorruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties reduce our profits disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation or result in lawsuits being brought against the company or its officers or directors in addition the operation of these laws or an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities or cease operations in certain countries that would otherwise support growth

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us accordingly fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues we are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our nonus business are generally reported in local currency which we then translate to us dollars for inclusion in our financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results we expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our nonus operations increases we enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in which we receive management and franchise fees but these efforts may not be successful these hedging agreements also do not cover all currencies in which we do business do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

some of our management agreements and related contracts require us to make payments to owners if the hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit  some of our contracts with hotel owners require that we fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit we may not be able to recover any fundings of such performance guarantees which could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful  we cannot assure you that new or newly acquired brands such as those we acquired as a result of the starwood combination our investments in placepass and the joint venture with alibaba our pilot of a homesharing offering in certain european cities or any other new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other guests we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products or that those brands programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new or newly acquired brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods volcanic activity wildfires and other natural disasters as well as manmade disasters and the potential spread of contagious diseases in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of guests have in the past caused and could in the future cause a decline in business or leisure travel and reduce demand for lodging to an extent and for durations that we are not able to predict actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest or civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits if a terrorist event were to involve one or more of our branded properties demand for our hotels in particular could suffer which could further hurt our revenues and profits 

disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product service or systems initiatives the timing and amount of capital investments and reimbursement for certain system initiatives and costs such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but we cannot always do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in an adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our company and our brands and any deterioration could adversely impact our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations  certain events including those that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands many other factors also can influence our reputation and the value of our brands including service food quality and safety availability and management of scarce natural resources supply chain management diversity human rights and support for local communities reputational value is also based on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us our brands and our hotels and it may 

 12 

be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or penalties or litigation negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including lost sales boycotts reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program  disruption of access to our websites and reservation systems loss of development opportunities or associate retention and recruiting difficulties any decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our brands or corporate image could affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations the data security incident could have a negative impact on our reputation our corporate image and our relationship with our guests 

if our brands goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record significant noncash charges to earnings  as of december 31 2018  we had 174 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred estimated fair values of our brands or reporting units could change if for example there are changes in the business climate unanticipated changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in guests’ perception and the reputation of our brands or changes in interest rates operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties for lodging timeshare residential and our credit card programs under the terms of their agreements with us our franchisees and licensees interact directly with guests and other third parties under our brand and trade names if these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems including any data breach involving guest information or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances it could be expensive or time consuming for us to pursue such remedies  we also cannot assure you that in every instance a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights or that we could collect any awarded damages from the defaulting franchisee or licensee 

collective bargaining activity and strikes could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs and interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies  a significant number of associates at our managed leased and owned hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements if relationships with our organized associates or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we operate could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations as we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 although we recently completed contract negotiations for 43 unionized hotels following multiweek strikes by our associates at 29 of those hotels a number of collective bargaining agreements are expected to be negotiated in 2019 labor disputes and disruptions have in the past and could in the future result in adverse publicity and adversely affect operations and revenues at affected hotels in addition labor disputes and disruptions could harm our relationship with our associates result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities harm our relationships with our guests and customers divert management attention and reduce customer demand for our services all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by our thirdparty property owners and franchisees increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses a shortage of skilled labor could also result in higher wages that would increase our labor costs which could reduce our profits 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance or the cost of such insurance could increase  marriott requires comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our 

 13 

managed leased and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary we require managed hotel owners to procure such coverage or we procure such coverage on their behalf we also require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we or our franchisees can obtain or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems may result in high deductibles low limits or may be uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance may be unacceptably high as a result we and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels or may not be successful in obtaining insurance at all for example in 2018 substantial increases in property insurance costs occurred due to the severe and widespread damage caused by the 2017 atlantic hurricane season and other natural disasters in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of any capital that we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations for the property 

development and financing risks 

while we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary  both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money to fund new hotel investments as well as to refurbish and improve existing hotels the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert little control obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our growth strategy for adding lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements and franchise agreements for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy and rate changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and demand for construction resources 

our development and renovation activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we occasionally develop or acquire and renovate hotel and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in 2014 and 2015 in connection with our development and construction of three edition hotels and residences our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 any future weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop or renovate could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays or cost overruns including those due to a shortage of skilled labor lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion 

our owned properties and other real estate investments subject us to numerous risks  although we had relatively few owned and leased properties at the end of 2018  such properties are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property although we have sold many properties in recent years and we are actively pursuing additional sales equity real estate investments can be difficult to sell quickly and we may not be able to do so at prices we find acceptable or at all moreover the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income 

 14 

earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties and the expenses incurred a variety of other factors also affect income from properties and real estate values including governmental regulations insurance zoning tax and eminent domain laws interest rate levels and the availability of financing for example new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive andor timeconsuming to develop real property or expand modify or renovate hotels when interest rates increase the cost of acquiring developing expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases similarly as financing becomes less available it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property finally under eminent domain laws governments can take real property sometimes for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth despite our assetlight strategy our real estate properties could be impacted by any of these factors resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition if our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses including needed capital expenditures our income could be adversely affected 

development and other investing activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes and may decrease our ability to manage risk  we have from time to time invested and may continue to invest in partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties these investments generally include some form of shared control over the development of the asset or operations of the business and create added risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours could take action without our approval or conversely prevent us from taking action without our partner’s approval or could make requests contrary to our policies or objectives should a venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partner’s share of the venture’s liabilities actions by a coventurer might subject the assets owned by the venture or partnership to additional risk such as increased project costs project delays or operational difficulties following project completion these risks may be more likely to occur in difficult business environments we cannot assure you that our investments through partnerships or joint ventures will be successful despite these risks 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  we participate through licensing agreements or directly or through noncontrolling interests in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under many of our luxury and premium brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including risks that 1 weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future development partners of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or the tax benefits of mortgage financing or residential ownership generally or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims or claims related to purchaser deposits and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

some hotel openings in our development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels which could adversely affect our growth prospects we report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline including hotels under construction and under signed contracts as well as hotels approved for development but not yet under contract the eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and in particular the approved hotels that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals competition for skilled construction labor and disruption in the supply chain for materials could cause construction timelines for pipeline hotels to lengthen accordingly we cannot assure you that all of our development pipeline will result in new hotels entering our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

if we incur losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties our profits could decline at times we make loans for hotel development or renovation expenditures when we enter into or amend management or franchise agreements from time to time we also provide thirdparty lenders with financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings we could suffer losses if hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded 

if owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed the owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced if those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all the lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property such sales or repossessions could in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows which could negatively affect our results of operations 

 15 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management property management human resources and payroll systems our loyalty program  and technologies we make available to our guests and for our associates these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and our business could suffer if we cannot do that as quickly or effectively as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  pricelinecom ®  bookingcom™ travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although our best rate guarantee and member rate programs have helped limit guest preference shift to intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract guests including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  yahoo ®  and baidu ®  to steer guests toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although we have successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from our direct online channels or through their fees increase the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels in addition if we are not able to negotiate new agreements on satisfactory terms when our existing contracts with intermediaries which generally have 2 to 3 year terms come up for renewal our business and prospects could be negatively impacted in a number of ways for example if newly negotiated agreements are on terms less favorable to our hotels than the expiring agreements or if we are not able to negotiate new agreements and our hotels no longer appear on intermediary websites our bookings could decline our profits and the operating profits of hotels in our system could decline and customers and owners may be less attracted to our brands we may not be able to recapture or offset any such loss of business through actions we take to enhance our direct marketing and reservation channels or to rely on other channels or other intermediary websites 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of company associate and guest data   in the operation of our business we collect store use and transmit large volumes of data regarding associates guests customers owners licensees franchisees and our own business operations including credit card numbers reservation and loyalty data and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in systems maintained by third parties including our owners franchisees licensees and service providers the integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business if this data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions 

our guests and associates also have a high expectation that we as well as our owners franchisees licensees and service providers will adequately protect and appropriately use their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by laws and governmental regulation our contractual obligations and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding in the us the european union asia and other jurisdictions where we operate our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners franchisees licensees and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing legal and regulatory requirements and associate and guest expectations or may require significant additional investments or time to do so we may incur significant additional costs to meet these requirements obligations and expectations and in the event of alleged or actual noncompliance we may experience increased operating costs increased exposure to fines and litigation and increased risk of damage to our reputation and brand 

the data security incident could have numerous adverse effects on our business as a result of the data security incident we are a party to numerous class action lawsuits brought by consumers and others in the us and canada one securities class action lawsuit in the us and one shareholder derivative lawsuit in the us we may be named as a party in additional lawsuits and other claims may be asserted by or on behalf of guests customers hotel owners shareholders or others seeking monetary damages or other relief a number of federal state and foreign governmental authorities   have also made inquiries or opened investigations related to the data security incident including under various data protection and privacy regulations such as the european union’s general data protection regulation in addition the major payment card networks require the completion of a forensic investigation by a certified investigative firm which is underway   responding to and resolving these lawsuits claims and investigations may result in material remedial and other expenses which may not be covered by insurance including fines governmental authorities investigating the data security incident also may seek to 

 16 

impose undertakings injunctive relief consent decrees or other civil or criminal penalties which could among other things materially increase our data security costs or otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business card issuers or payment card networks may seek to attribute losses or other expenses to the data security incident and we cannot currently determine to what extent those losses and expenses may be our legal responsibility significant management time and company resources have been and may continue to be devoted to the data security incident the data security incident and publicity related to it could have a range of other adverse effects on our business or prospects including causing or contributing to loss of consumer confidence reduced consumer demand reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program  loss of development opportunities and associate retention and recruiting difficulties these expenses and other adverse effects could have a material effect on our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations although we maintain insurance designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data security incident that insurance may not be sufficient or available to cover all of our expenses or other losses including fines related to the data security incident further as a result of the data security incident and market forces beyond our control relevant insurance coverage may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

our remediation efforts related to the data security incident will be costly and may not be effective following the data security incident we implemented additional technical measures on our network designed to contain and remove the threats identified during our investigation secure the starwood reservations database and monitor for any further unauthorized activity we also accelerated ongoing security enhancements to our network we have incurred costs in connection with these remediation efforts to date and we could incur additional significant costs as we take further steps designed to prevent unauthorized access to our network the technical measures we have taken are based on our investigation of the causes of the data security incident but additional measures may be needed to prevent a similar incident in the future and such measures may not be sufficient to prevent other types of incidents we cannot assure you that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and remediated and will not occur again 

additional cybersecurity incidents could have adverse effects on our business  the data security incident was significant went undetected for a long period of time and could have numerous adverse effects on our business as discussed above if we experience additional cyber security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to additional cyber security incidents the severity of the adverse effects on our business could be magnified we have implemented security measures to safeguard our systems and data and we intend to continue implementing additional measures in the future but as with the data security incident our measures may not be sufficient to maintain the confidentiality security or availability of the data we collect store and use to operate our business measures taken by our service providers or our owners franchisees licensees and their service providers also may not be sufficient efforts to hack or circumvent security measures efforts to gain unauthorized access to data failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses “ransomware” or other malware “phishing” or other types of business email compromises operator error or inadvertent releases of data have impacted and may in the future impact our information systems and records or those of our owners franchisees licensees or service providers our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by third parties to gain unauthorized access or prevent authorized access to such systems have greatly increased in recent years we have experienced cyberattacks attempts to disrupt access to our systems and data and attempts to affect the integrity of our data and the frequency and sophistication of such efforts could continue to increase in addition to the consequences of the data security incident discussed above any significant theft of unauthorized access to loss of loss of access to or fraudulent use of guest associate owner franchisee licensee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in legal regulatory and other consequences including remedial and other expenses fines or litigation depending on the nature and scope of the event compromises in the security of our information systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits negative publicity and other adverse effects on our business including lost sales boycotts reduced enrollment andor participation in our loyalty program  litigation loss of development opportunities or associate retention and recruiting difficulties all of which could affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage information systems change frequently can be difficult to detect for long periods of time and can involve difficult or prolonged assessment or remediation periods even once detected which could magnify the severity of these adverse effects in addition although we carry cyberprivacy liability insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all expenses or other losses including fines or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyberattacks security compromises and other related incidents and until we renew our current policy and a new policy period begins our policy coverage limits will be reduced by the amount of claims paid related to the data security incident furthermore in the future such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

changes in privacy and data security laws could increase our operating costs increase our exposure to fines and litigation and adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we are subject to numerous complex and

frequently changing laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information including in the us the european union asia and other jurisdictions nonus data privacy and data security laws various us federal and state laws payment card industry security standards and other information privacy and security standards are all applicable to us significant legislative or regulatory changes could be adopted in the future including in reaction to the data security incident or data breaches experienced by other companies compliance with changes in applicable data privacy laws and regulations and contractual obligations including responding to investigations into our compliance may restrict our business operations increase our operating costs increase our exposure to fines and litigation in the event of alleged noncompliance and adversely affect our reputation following the data security incident the information commissioner’s office in the united kingdom “ico” notified us that it had opened an investigation into our online privacy policy and related practices this investigation is separate from the ico’s investigation specifically related to the data security incident as a result of this investigation we could be exposed to significant fines and remediation costs in addition to any imposed as a result of the data security incident and adverse publicity related to the investigation could adversely affect our reputation 

additionally we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international privacy eprivacy and antispam laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential guests and customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists were to be prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new guests and customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

any disruption in the functioning of our reservation systems could adversely affect our performance and results we manage global reservation systems that communicate reservations to our branded hotels that individuals make directly with us online through our mobile apps through our telephone call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed accuracy and efficiency of our reservation systems are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands our business may suffer if we fail to maintain upgrade or prevent disruption to our reservation systems in addition the risk of disruption in the functioning of our global reservation systems could increase with the ongoing systems integration that is part of our integration of starwood disruptions in or changes to our reservation systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data 

other risks 

ineffective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements reduce investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price  as discussed in part ii item 8 “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” later in this report in the 2018 fourth quarter we identified a material weakness in internal control related to our accounting for our loyalty program  which resulted in errors in our previously issued financial statements for the 2018 first second and third quarters internal controls related to the implementation of asu 201409 and the accounting for our loyalty program  are important to accurately reflect our financial position and results of operations in our financial reports we are in the process of remediating the material weakness but our efforts may not be successful if we are unable to remediate the material weakness in an appropriate and timely manner or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses our ability to accurately record process and report financial information and consequently our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in violations of applicable securities laws stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements subject us to litigation and investigations negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets 

changes in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs  we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world including those for financial reporting taxes healthcare cybersecurity privacy climate change and the environment changes to such laws regulations or policies could reduce our profits we also anticipate that many of the jurisdictions where we do business will continue to review taxes and other revenue raising measures and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices or reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could significantly impact us and other modifications could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our operations or could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured 

 18 

we could be subject to additional tax liabilities we are subject to a variety of taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions 

our tax expense and liabilities may also be affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example the legislation known as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “ 2017 tax act ” requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 tax act  significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the us internal revenue service and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act  will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made 

we are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  under the delaware business combination statute a shareholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the shareholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without shareholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a shareholder rights plan

business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotel residential and timeshare properties in 130  countries and territories under 30  brand names under our assetlight business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them we discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments north american fullservice  north american limitedservice  and asia pacific  our europe middle east and africa and caribbean and latin america operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments  

we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us in most markets base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue or certain propertylevel revenue in the case of franchise fees while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return in our middle east and africa and asia pacific regions incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit also referred to as “house profit” which we discuss under the “performance measures” section below less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance real estate taxes and capital spending reserves 

our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while adding new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling our investments maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility 

we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control costs both at companyoperated properties and at the corporate level “aboveproperty” we provide our guests new and memorable experiences through our portfolio of brands innovative technology personalized guest recognition and access to travel experiences through our marriott bonvoy moments program our brands remain strong due to our skilled management teams dedicated associates superior guest service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction significant distribution our loyalty program  multichannel reservation systems and desirable property amenities we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution 

we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities technology offerings and guest experiences we address through various means hotels in our system that do not meet our standards we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse websites and of our associated mobile smartphone applications through functionality and service improvements 

our profitability as well as that of owners and franchisees has benefited from our approach to propertylevel and aboveproperty productivity managed properties in our system continue to maintain tight cost controls we also control aboveproperty costs some of which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas

data security incident 

on november 30 2018 we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the starwood reservations database the “data security incident” working with leading security experts we determined that there was unauthorized access to the starwood network since 2014 and that an unauthorized party had copied information from the starwood reservations database and taken steps towards removing it the information copied from the starwood reservations database over time included information about guests who made a reservation at a starwood property including names mailing addresses phone numbers email addresses passport numbers payment card numbers and expiration dates starwood preferred guest account information dates of birth gender arrival and departure information reservation dates and communication preferences the combination of information varied by guest based on our analysis as of the date of this filing w e believe that the upper limit for the total number of guest records involved in this incident is approximately 383 million records in many instances there appear to be multiple records for the same guest so we have concluded with a fair degree of certainty that information for fewer than 383 million unique guests was involved although we are currently unable to quantify that lower number because of the nature of the data in the database based on our analysis as of the date of this filing w e believe that the information accessed by an unauthorized third party included approximately 525 million unencrypted passport numbers approximately 185 million encrypted passport numbers and approximately 91 million encrypted payment card numbers approximately 385000 of which cards were unexpired as of september 2018 certain data analytics work continues including by the investigative firm engaged on behalf of the payment card networks and based on the preliminary information we have as of the date of this filing we believe that the information accessed by an unauthorized third party could include several thousand unencrypted payment card numbers 

upon receiving information that an alert from an internal security tool was related to an attempt to access the starwood reservations database we quickly engaged leading security experts to conduct a comprehensive forensic review to determine the scope of the intrusion including the specific data impacted and assist with containment measures while that forensic review of the incident is now complete certain data analytics work continues we reported this incident to law enforcement and continue to support their investigation we have completed the planned phase out of the operation of the starwood reservations database effective as of the end of 2018 

following the data security incident we began a guest outreach effort and offered certain services to help guests monitor and protect their information promptly following our announcement of the incident we began sending emails on a rolling basis directly to various starwood guests whose email addresses were in the starwood reservations database and we completed sending these emails on december 21 2018  w e also established a multilanguage dedicated website and multilanguage call center to answer guests’ questions about the incident  the dedicated website provides guests details of the incident the information affected the steps being taken to investigate faqs and information about how guests can monitor and protect their information we are offering free web monitoring solutions for affected guests in certain jurisdictions where the monitoring services are available 

to date we have not seen a meaningful impact on demand as a result of the data security incident 

we are currently unable to estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the company from the data security incident however we do not believe this incident will impact our longterm financial health we maintain insurance designed to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data security incident we expect that the cost of such insurance will increase significantly in 2019 and future years we expect to incur significant expenses associated with the data security incident in future periods primarily related to legal proceedings and regulatory investigations increased expenses and capital investments for it and information security incident response and customer care and increased expenses for insurance compliance activities and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements see footnote 7 commitments and contingencies  for information related to expenses incurred in 2018 insurance recoveries and legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the data security incident 

performance measures   

we believe revpar which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which are components of calculating revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels 

our revpar statistics for 2018  2017  and 2016  include legacystarwood comparable properties for each of the full years even though marriott did not own the legacystarwood brands before the merger date therefore our revpar statistics 

 25 

include legacystarwood properties for periods during which fees from the legacystarwood properties are not included in our income statements we provide these revpar statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we define our comparable properties as our properties including those that we acquired through the starwood combination that were open and operating under one of our legacymarriott or legacystarwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year since january 1 2017  for the current period and have not in either the current or previous year i undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions ii been converted between companyoperated and franchised or iii sustained substantial property damage or business interruption for 2018  compared to 2017  we had 4109 comparable north american properties and 1173 comparable international properties for 2017  compared to 2016  we had 3883 comparable north american properties and 1030 comparable international properties 

we also believe companyoperated house profit margin which is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit to total propertylevel revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

business trends 

our 2018  fullyear results reflected a yearoveryear increase in the number of properties in our system favorable demand for our brands in many markets around the world and generally favorable economic conditions comparable worldwide systemwide revpar for 2018  increased 26 percent  to 11737  adr increased 20 percent  on a constant dollar basis to 16037  and occupancy increased 04  percentage points to 732 percent  compared to 2017  

in north america revpar increased in 2018  driven by both higher transient and group demand revpar growth was partially constrained by new lodging supply in certain markets and comparisons to 2017 natural disasters in our asia pacific  segment in 2018 revpar grew in most markets led by china indonesia and india our europe region experienced higher demand in 2018 led by strong transient business in most countries and demand from the world cup partially constrained by lower revpar in spain in our middle east and africa region revpar decreased due to geopolitical instability and supply growth in the middle east partially offset by strong growth in africa revpar grew across our caribbean and latin america region driven by higher adr partially due to lower supply following 2017 hurricane activity in the caribbean 

for our companyoperated properties we continue to focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins and making productivity improvements in 2018  compared to 2017  at comparable properties worldwide companyoperated house profit margins increased by 40  basis points primarily reflecting revpar growth improved productivity procurement cost savings and synergy savings from the starwood combination international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 70  basis points and north american companyoperated house profit margins increased by 10  basis points 

system growth and pipeline 

in 2018  we added 494  properties with 80255  rooms around the world across our portfolio of brands approximately 45 percent  of the added rooms are located outside north america and 12 percent  are conversions from competitor brands in 2018  107  properties  21176  rooms exited our system 

at yearend 2018  our development pipeline grew to a record 478000  rooms with more than half located outside of north america the pipeline includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts and nearly 23000  hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts in 2018 we signed management and franchise agreements for 816 properties 125000 rooms setting company records for rooms signings in europe and middle east and africa and hotel signings in asia pacific contracts signed in 2018 also reflected the company’s strength in the industry’s highest tier with 29 properties 6200 rooms signed across six luxury brands 

in 2019  we expect the number of our open hotel rooms will increase approximately 55 percent  net reflecting room exits of 10 to 15 percent

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2018  2017  and 2016  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” our income statements include legacystarwood’s results of operations from the merger date all references to the effect of legacystarwood operations on our 2017 results refer to the incremental amounts contributed by legacystarwood operations in 2017 over the effect of legacystarwood operations on our results for the period from the merger date through december 31 2016 

the following discussion also reflects our adoption of several new accounting standards see the “new accounting standards adopted” caption in footnote 2 summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 

our 2017 results were favorably impacted by the nonrecurring gain on the disposition of our ownership interest in avendra discussed in footnote 3 dispositions and acquisitions  we committed to the owners of the hotels in our system that the benefits derived from avendra including any dividends or sale proceeds above our original investment would be used for the benefit of the hotels in our system accordingly in 2018 we used 115 million 85 million aftertax of the net proceeds and we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for the benefit of our system of hotels spending under those plans is and will be expensed in the “reimbursed expenses” caption of our income statements causing a reduction in our profitability in the periods it is expensed 

fee revenues 



2018  compared to 2017   

the 38 million   increase  in base management fees primarily reflected 29 million from unit growth 28 million from revpar growth and 8 million from net favorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower fees of 17 million from properties that converted from managed to franchised and 14 million from properties that were terminated 

the 263 million   increase  in franchise fees primarily reflected 143 million of higher branding fees driven by 138 million of higher fees from our cobrand credit card agreements 82 million from unit growth 21 million from revpar growth 15 million from properties that converted from managed to franchised and 6 million of higher relicensing and application fees partially offset by lower fees of 9 million from properties that were terminated 

the 42 million   increase  in incentive management fees primarily reflected net higher profits at managed hotels and 14 million from unit growth 

in 2018  we earned incentive management fees from 72 percent  of our managed properties worldwide versus 71 percent  in 2017  we earned incentive management fees from 59 percent  of managed properties in north america and 82 percent  of managed properties outside north america in 2018  compared to 60 percent  in north america and 80 percent  outside north america in 2017  in addition 63 percent  of our total incentive management fees in 2018  came from our managed properties outside north america versus 62 percent  in 2017  

2017  compared to 2016 

the 296 million   increase  in base management fees primarily reflected 273 million of higher legacystarwood fees 18 million from stronger sales at legacymarriott comparable properties primarily driven by revpar growth and 14 million from legacymarriott unit growth partially offset by 6 million of lower fees from legacymarriott properties that converted from managed to franchised and 4 million from legacymarriott net unfavorable exchange rates 

the 429 million   increase  in franchise fees primarily reflected 341 million of higher legacystarwood fees 54 million from legacymarriott unit growth 18 million from legacymarriott revpar growth 14 million of higher legacymarriott branding fees and 7 million of higher fees from legacymarriott properties that converted from managed to franchised 

 30 

the 182 million   increase  in incentive management fees primarily reflected 159 million of higher legacystarwood fees and 22 million from higher net house profits at legacymarriott managed hotels 

the 10 million   increase  in contract investment amortization primarily reflected 5 million of higher contract writeoffs related to terminated contracts at legacymarriott hotels 

owned leased and other 



2018  compared to 2017   

owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased  by 12 million  primarily due to 81 million of lower owned and leased profits attributable to properties sold partially offset by 51 million of higher termination fees and 17 million of net stronger results at our remaining owned and leased properties 

2017  compared to 2016   

owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses increased  by 117 million  primarily due to 140 million of higher legacystarwood owned and leased profits partially offset by 15 million of lower global design profits and 7 million of net lower legacymarriott owned and leased profits primarily driven by lower revpar in brazil and properties under renovation   

cost reimbursements 

cost reimbursement revenue net of reimbursed expenses varies due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized programs and services and the related reimbursements we receive from hotel owners and franchisees over the long term our centralized programs and services are not designed to impact our economics either positively or negatively 

2018  compared to 2017   

cost reimbursement revenue net of reimbursed expenses decreased   462 million  primarily due to lower loyalty program  revenues net of expenses spending funded by the proceeds from the 2017 sale of our interest in avendra and higher expenses for reservations and marketing 

2017  compared to 2016   

cost reimbursement revenue net of reimbursed expenses increased   127 million  primarily due to 285 million of higher legacystarwood activity partially offset by 158 million of lower legacymarriott cost reimbursement revenue net of reimbursed expenses primarily driven by higher expenses for reservations and it systems initiatives and lower marriott rewards revenue net of expenses 

other operating expenses 

2018  compared to 2017   

general administrative and other expenses increased  by 6 million  primarily due to 51 million of companyfunded supplemental retirement savings plan contributions in 2018 and 20 million of higher professional fees partially offset by 

 31 

administrative cost savings largely due to synergies associated with the starwood combination companyfunded supplemental retirement savings plan contributions represent an additional onetime contribution of up to 1000 per eligible associate 

mergerrelated costs and charges decreased  by 4 million  primarily due to 17 million of 2017 transaction costs that did not occur in 2018 and 6 million of lower employee termination costs partially offset by 19 million of higher integration costs 

2017  compared to 2016 

depreciation amortization and other expenses increased  by 110 million  primarily reflecting higher depreciation and amortization on legacystarwood assets 

general administrative and other expenses increased  by 178 million  primarily due to the starwood combination 14 million of higher litigation expenses 10 million of higher compensation expenses and 10 million from net unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

mergerrelated costs and charges decreased  by 227 million  primarily due to lower employee termination and transaction costs partially offset by 39 million of higher integration costs 

nonoperating income expense 



2018  compared to 2017   

gains and other income net decreased  by 494 million  primarily due to the 2017 gain on the disposition of our ownership interest in avendra net of a 2018 trueup 653 million and the 2017 gain on the sale of the charlotte marriott city center 24 million partially offset by 2018 gains on our property sales 132 million sales of our interest in four equity method investments 46 million and modification of a ground lease at one of our offices 6 million 

interest expense increased  by 52 million  primarily due to higher commercial paper interest rates and average borrowings and higher interest on senior note issuances net of maturities 6 million

interest expense increased  by 54 million  primarily due to an increase in debt as a result of the starwood combination and higher commercial paper borrowings partially offset by 18 million of lower interest due to senior note maturities and a 13 million favorable variance to the bridge term loan facility commitment costs that we incurred in 2016 

interest income increased  by 3 million  primarily due to issuances of new loans partially offset by 7 million of lower interest income on a repaid loan

 32 

income taxes 



2018  compared to 2017

business segments 

the following discussion presents an analysis of the results of operations of our reportable business segments north american fullservice  north american limitedservice  and asia pacific  our europe middle east and africa and caribbean and latin america operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments  and accordingly we have not included those operations in this discussion of our business segments see footnote 17 business segments  to our financial statements for other information about each segment including revenues and a reconciliation of segment profits to net income 

our 2016 results in this section do not include any legacystarwood results for the period between the merger date and the end of the 2016 third quarter as we did not allocate any legacystarwood results to our segments for the eight days ended september 30 2016 

north american fullservice 



2018  compared to 2017 

in 2018  across our north american fullservice  segment we added 44  properties  10454  rooms and 20  properties  6923  rooms left our system   

north american fullservice  segment profits decreased  by 85 million  primarily due to the following

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facility   

we are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement the “credit facility” that provides for up to 4 billion of aggregate effective borrowings to support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures share repurchases letters of credit and acquisitions borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating while any outstanding commercial paper borrowings andor borrowings under our credit facility generally have shortterm maturities we classify the outstanding borrowings as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a longterm basis the credit facility expires on june 10 2021   

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage the ratio of adjusted total debt to ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 the credit facility defines ebitda as net income less cost reimbursement revenue plus reimbursed expenses plus the sum of interest expense income taxes depreciation amortization and nonrecurring noncash charges 

our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations remain adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

we issue commercial paper in the us we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2018  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 2067 million  and reflected borrowing capacity of 1751 million  under our credit facility and our cash balance of 316 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 4 billion  of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting 2249 million  of outstanding commercial paper there being no  outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility 

 36 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans and fund our liquidity needs we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings issuances of senior notes and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations but which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

cash from operations 

cash from operations and noncash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows   



 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 04  to 10 at yearend 2018  and 05  to 10 at yearend 2017  we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

investing activities cash flows 

acquisition of a business net of cash acquired cash outflows of 2392 million  in 2016 were due to the starwood combination see footnote 3 dispositions and acquisitions  for more information 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 556 million  in 2018  240 million  in 2017  and 199 million  in 2016  capital expenditures in 2018   increased  by 316 million  compared to 2017  primarily reflecting the acquisition of the sheraton grand phoenix improvements to our worldwide systems and net higher spending on several owned properties capital expenditures in 2017   increased  by 41 million  compared to 2016  primarily due to improvements to our worldwide systems and improvements to hotels acquired in the starwood combination 

we expect spending on capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately 500 million  to 700 million  for 2019  including acquisitions loan advances equity and other investments contract acquisition costs and various capital expenditures including approximately 225 million  for maintenance capital spending 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations in the starwood combination we acquired various hotels and joint venture interests in hotels most of which we have sold or are seeking to sell and in 2018 we acquired the sheraton grand phoenix which we expect to renovate and sell subject to a longterm management agreement we also expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include property acquisitions new construction loans guarantees and noncontrolling equity investments over time we seek to minimize capital invested in our business through asset sales subject to long term operating or franchise agreements 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because 1 we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated 479 million  cash proceeds in 2018  and 1418 million  in 2017  see footnote 3 dispositions and acquisitions  for more information on dispositions 

 37 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan collections net of loan advances amounted to 35 million  in 2018  compared to net collections of 94 million  in 2017  at yearend 2018  we had 131 million  of senior mezzanine and other loans outstanding compared to 149 million  outstanding at yearend 2017  

equity method investments cash outflows of 72 million  in 2018  62 million  in 2017  and 13 million  in 2016  for equity method investments primarily reflect our investments in several joint ventures 

financing activities cash flows 

debt debt increased  by 1109 million  in 2018  to 9347 million  at yearend 2018  from 8238 million  at yearend 2017  primarily due to the issuance of our series x y z and aa notes partially offset by the maturity of our series s notes 330 million and lower outstanding commercial paper 126 million see footnote 10 longterm debt  for additional information on the debt issuances 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2018  our longterm debt had a weighted average interest rate of 33 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 48 years the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 07 to 10 at yearend 2018  

see the “ cash requirements and our credit facility ” caption in this “liquidity and capital resources” section for more information on our credit facility 

share repurchases we purchased 215 million shares of our common stock in 2018  at an average price of 13067  per share 292 million  shares in 2017  at an average price of 10366  per share and 80 million  shares in 2016  at an average price of 7155  per share at yearend 2018  107 million  shares remained available for repurchase under board approved authorizations and on february 15 2019 our board of directors further increased our common stock repurchase authorization by 25 million shares  for additional information see “ fourth quarter 2018 issuer purchases of equity securities ” in part ii item 5

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if 1 we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

while we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made actual results may differ significantly additionally changes in our assumptions estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

see footnote 2 summary of significant accounting policies  for further information related to our critical accounting policies and estimates which are as follows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates stock prices currency exchange rates and debt prices we manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floatingrate notes receivable and floatingrate debt changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixedrate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt 

we are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment 

we use derivative instruments including cash flow hedges net investment in nonus operations hedges and other derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates as a matter of policy we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes see footnote 2 summary of significant accounting policies  for more information on derivative instruments

controls and procedures 

tableend disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report we evaluated under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of those controls and procedures which by their nature can provide only reasonable assurance about management’s control objectives you should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote based upon this evaluation our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below in light of the material weakness management performed additional procedures to validate the accuracy and completeness of the financial results impacted by the control deficiencies such procedures included the validation of data underlying key financial models substantive logic inspection fluctuation analyses and detailed testing 

material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

a material weakness as defined in rule 12b2 under the exchange act is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

in the 2018 fourth quarter we identified the following deficiencies in the design of internal control over financial reporting for our loyalty program 

 these control deficiencies resulted in errors in the calculation of cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses in our previously issued financial statements for the 2018 first second and third quarters although the errors were not material to those financial statements we concluded that the combination of control deficiencies represented a material weakness ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has independently assessed our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included in part ii item 8 of this report 

remediation of material weakness 

we have developed a remediation plan that includes steps to increase dedicated personnel improve reporting processes and enhance related supporting technology we are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated as soon as possible 

internal control over financial reporting 

we have set forth management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and we incorporate those reports here by reference 

as outlined above we are in the process of taking steps to remediate the material weakness we made no other changes in internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2018  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

terms of our management agreements vary but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and 

 3 

indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a specified percentage of annual revenues that exceed a fixed amount many of our operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners many of our operating agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured those deficiencies in certain circumstances some of our management agreements allow owners to convert companyoperated properties to franchised properties under our brands 

for the lodging facilities we operate we generally are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs we provide centralized reservation services and national advertising marketing and promotional services as well as various accounting and data processing services and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs 

franchised licensed and unconsolidated joint venture properties 

we have franchising licensing and joint venture programs that permit other hotel owners and operators and two timeshare companies to use many of our lodging brand names and systems under our hotel franchising programs we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees which typically range from four to six percent of room revenues for all brands plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain fullservice hotels we are a partner in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage and in some cases own hotels some of these joint ventures also provide services to franchised hotels we recognize our share of these joint ventures’ net income or loss in the “ equity in earnings ” caption of our income statements franchisees and certain joint ventures contribute to our national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems

at yearend 2017  we operated 23  hotel reservation centers eight  in the us and 15  in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own two  of the us facilities and either lease the others or share space with a companyoperated property while pricing is set by our hotels our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and franchisees and enhance our fee revenue 

we believe our global sales and revenue management organizations are a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people processes and systems our aboveproperty sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around how the customer wants to buy reducing duplication of efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts we also utilize innovative and sophisticated revenue management systems many of which are proprietary which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increasing efficiency and producing higher propertylevel revenue for hotels in our portfolio most of the hotels in our portfolio utilize webbased programs to effectively manage the rate setup and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

as we further discuss in part i item 1a “risk factors” later in this report we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation revenue management and property management systems in our loyalty programs  and in other aspects of our business we also make certain technologies available to our guests keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position furthermore the integrity and protection of customer guest employee and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency 

sustainability and social impact  guided by our 2025 sustainability and social impact goals as well as the united nations sustainable development goals we believe we have an opportunity to create a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business in 2017 we launched our new sustainability and social impact platform serve 360 doing good in every direction the platform is built around four focus areas nurture our world empower through opportunity sustainable operations and welcome all and advance human rights within each of these areas we have identified a series of goals that we have embarked upon to show progress through 2025 examples of these goals include commitments to volunteering investments in our communities reduction of our environmental impact and human rights training 

global design division  our global design division provides design development refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts like thirdparty contractors global design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor according to lodging industry data there are over 1100 lodging management companies in the us including approximately 20 that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels operate hotels on behalf of thirdparty owners and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria 

we also compete for guests with large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model search engines such as google and bing and online services including airbnb and homeaway that allow travelers to book shortterm rentals of homes and apartments as an alternative to hotel rooms we compete against lodging operators and other competitors for guests in many areas including brand recognition and reputation location guest satisfaction room rates quality of service amenities quality of accommodations security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points 

during the last recession demand for hotel rooms declined significantly particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2017 cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain guest loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2017  approximately 71 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the owner pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system in the franchising business we face many competitors that have strong 

 9 

brands and guest appeal including hilton intercontinental hotels group hyatt wyndham accor choice carlson rezidor best western la quinta and others 

outside the us branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers decline international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have an approximately 15 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a four percent share of the hotel market outside the us we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong guest preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to guest preference across all our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic refurbishment and replacement of furnishings fixtures and equipment these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

employee relations 

at yearend 2017  we had approximately 177000 employees approximately 23000 of whom were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national regional state or provincial and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation and development of properties complies in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future 

internet address and company sec filings 

our primary internet address is marriottcom on the investor relations portion of our website marriottcominvestor we provide a link to our electronic filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” including our annual report on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and any amendments to these reports we make all such filings available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing the information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

forwardlooking statements   

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statement the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this 

 10 

report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether due to new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties   

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forwardlooking statements contained in this report or in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties and home and apartment sharing services for guests  we operate in markets that contain many competitors each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains and home and apartment sharing services in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty programs  and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline further new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets 

economic downturns could impact our financial results and growth  weak economic conditions in one or more parts of the world changes in oil prices and currency values potential disruptions in the us economy generally and the travel business in particular that might result from the us administration’s changing policies in such areas as trade travel immigration healthcare and related issues political instability in some areas and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions could continue could have a negative impact on the lodging industry us government travel is also a significant part of our business and this aspect of our business could suffer due to us federal spending cuts or government hiring restrictions and any further limitations that may result from presidential or congressional action or inaction because of such uncertainty we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if economic or these other conditions worsen 

risks relating to our integration of starwood 

the continued diversion of resources and management’s attention to the integration of starwood could still adversely affect our daytoday business  while the integration of starwood is well underway it places a significant burden on our management and internal resources and will continue to do so for some time the diversion of management’s attention away from daytoday business concerns and any difficulties we encounter as the integration process continues could adversely affect our financial results 

some of the anticipated benefits of combining starwood and marriott may still not be realized we decided to acquire starwood with the expectation that the starwood combination will result in various benefits including among other things operating efficiencies although we have already achieved some of those anticipated benefits others remain subject to several uncertainties including whether we can continue to effectively and efficiently integrate the starwood business and whether and on what terms we can reach agreement with the timeshare companies with whom we do business to allow us to move to a single unified reservation system and loyalty platform 

integration could also take longer than we anticipate and involve unexpected costs disruptions of each legacy company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems could adversely affect the combined company we also may still encounter difficulties harmonizing our different reservations and other systems and business practices as the integration process continues because of these or other factors we cannot assure you when or that we will be able to fully realize additional benefits from the starwood combination in the form of eliminating duplicative costs or achieving other operating efficiencies cost savings or benefits 

risks relating to our business 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which we fail or elect not to cure some courts have also applied agency law principles and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have 

 11 

interpreted hotel management agreements to be “personal services contracts” this means among other things that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future if terminations occur for these or other reasons we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

our lodging operations are subject to global regional and national conditions  because we conduct our business on a global platform changes in global and regional economies impact our activities in recent years decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures resulting from the threat of further terrorism have hurt our business our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic and political environment in each of our operating regions the resulting unknown pace of both business and leisure travel and any future incidents or changes in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the us makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation   at yearend 2017  approximately 36  percent of the rooms in our system were located outside of the us and its territories we expect that our international operations and resulting revenues will continue to grow this increasingly exposes us to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the us many of which are outside of our control and which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions disrupt our business or damage our reputation these challenges include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and government policies that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as competition laws cybersecurity and privacy laws currency regulations and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 4 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws 5 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 6 currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact the results and cash flows of our international operations 

any failure by our international operations to comply with anticorruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs reduce our profits limit our growth harm our reputation or subject us to broader liability we are subject to restrictions imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and anticorruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations such as the uk bribery act anticorruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons to receive or retain business these laws also require us to maintain adequate internal controls and accurate books and records due to the starwood combination we now have more properties in countries outside of the us including in many parts of the world where corruption is common and our compliance with anticorruption laws may potentially conflict with local customs and practices the compliance programs internal controls and policies we and prior to the merger date starwood maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws may not prevent our associates contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations we are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and the us department of commerce our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules the us may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected any violations of anticorruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties reduce our profits disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation or result in lawsuits being brought against the company or its officers or directors in addition the operation of these laws or an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities or cease operations in certain countries that would otherwise support growth 

in connection with the starwood combination we are currently assessing various regulatory compliance matters at several foreign legacystarwood locations including compliance with the us fcpa the results of this assessment may give rise to contingencies that could require us to accrue expenses the amounts of which we are not able to currently estimate 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us accordingly fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues we are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our nonus business are generally reported in local 

 12 

currency which we then translate to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results we expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our nonus operations increases we enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in which we receive management and franchise fees but these efforts may not be successful these hedging agreements also do not cover all currencies in which we do business do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

some of our management agreements and related contracts require us to make payments to owners if the hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit  some of our contracts with hotel owners require that we fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit we may not be able to recover any fundings of such performance guarantees which could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful  we cannot assure you that recently launched or newly acquired brands such as edition ac hotels by marriott in the americas protea hotels moxy delta hotels and those we acquired as a result of the starwood combination our recently announced investments in placepass and the joint venture with alibaba or any other new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other guests we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products or that those brands programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new or newly acquired brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other natural disasters such as 2017 hurricanes harvey irma and maria that caused severe damage in houston the florida keys puerto rico the us virgin islands and many other caribbean islands recent earthquakes and manmade disasters in recent years as well as the potential spread of contagious diseases such as mers middle east respiratory syndrome zika virus and ebola in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of guests could cause a decline in business or leisure travel and reduce demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest or civil strife such as recent events in las vegas fort lauderdale orlando barcelona berlin brussels london manchester paris turkey ukraine and russia the middle east and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits if a terrorist event were to involve one or more of our branded properties demand for our hotels in particular could suffer which could further hurt our revenues and profits 

disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product service or systems initiatives the timing and amount of capital investments and reimbursement for certain system initiatives and costs such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but we cannot always do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in an adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our company and our brands and any deterioration could adversely impact our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations  events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands many other factors also can influence our reputation and the value of our brands including service food quality and safety availability and management of scarce natural resources supply chain management diversity human rights and support for local communities reputational value is also based on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us our brands and our hotels and it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social 

 13 

media publicity governmental investigations or penalties or litigation negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts lost sales disruption of access to our websites and reservation systems loss of development opportunities or associate retention and recruiting difficulties any decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our brands or corporate image could affect our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

if our brands goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record significant noncash charges to earnings  as of december 31 2017  we had 180 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred estimated fair values of our brands or reporting units could change if for example there are changes in the business climate unanticipated changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in guests’ perception and the reputation of our brands or changes in interest rates operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties for lodging timeshare residential and our credit card programs under the terms of their agreements with us our franchisees and licensees interact directly with guests and other third parties under our brand and trade names if these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems including any data breach involving guest information or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances it could be expensive or time consuming for us to pursue such remedies  we also cannot assure you that in every instance a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies  a significant number of associates at our managed leased and owned hotels approximately 16 percent in the us and approximately 13 percent worldwide are covered by collective bargaining agreements if relationships with those associates or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we operate could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations collective bargaining agreements representing approximately half of our organized associates in the us are expiring in 2018 and are in the process of being renegotiated labor disputes which are generally more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being renegotiated could harm our relationship with our associates result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services 

labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by our thirdparty property owners and franchisees increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance or the cost of such insurance could increase  marriott requires comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed leased and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary we require managed hotel owners to procure such coverage or we procure such coverage on their behalf we also require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we or our franchisees can obtain or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems may result in high deductibles low limits or may be uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance may be unacceptably high as a result we and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels and we expect substantial increases in property insurance costs in 2018 and possibly future years due to the severe and widespread damage caused by the 2017 atlantic hurricane season in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of any capital that we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated 

 14 

future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations for the property 

development and financing risks 

while we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary  both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money to fund new hotel investments as well as to refurbish and improve existing hotels the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert little control obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our growth strategy for adding lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements and franchise agreements for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we occasionally develop new hotel and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in 2014 and 2015 in connection with our development and construction of three edition hotels and residences our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays or cost overruns including those due to a shortage of skilled labor lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion 

our owned properties and other real estate investments subject us to numerous risks  although we had relatively few owned and leased properties at the end of 2017  we acquired a significant number of those properties as part of the starwood combination and such properties are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property although we have sold several of those properties since the merger date and we are actively pursuing additional sales equity real estate investments can be difficult to sell quickly and we may not be able to do so at prices we find acceptable or at all moreover the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties and the expenses incurred a variety of other factors also affect income from properties and real estate values including governmental regulations insurance zoning tax and eminent domain laws interest rate levels and the availability of financing for example new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive andor timeconsuming to develop real property or expand modify or renovate hotels when interest rates increase the cost of acquiring developing expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases similarly as financing becomes less available it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property finally under eminent domain laws governments can take real property sometimes for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth despite our assetlight strategy our real estate properties could be impacted by any of these factors resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition if our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses including needed capital expenditures our income could be adversely affected 

 15 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks  partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties which we have entered into or acquired as part of the starwood combination generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments 

investing through partnerships or joint ventures decreases our ability to manage risk  in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly starwood and to a lesser extent marriott has from time to time invested and we may continue to invest as a coventurer such arrangements often have shared control over the operation of the assets therefore such investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the coventurer might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations should a venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partner’s share of the venture’s liabilities also our venture partner could have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals take action contrary to our instructions or make requests contrary to our policies or objectives further we may be unable to act without the approval of our venture partners and alternatively our venture partners could take actions binding on the venture or partnership without our consent therefore actions by a coventurer might subject the assets owned by the venture or partnership to additional risk we cannot assure you that our investments through partnerships or joint ventures will be successful despite these risks 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  we participate through licensing agreements or directly or through noncontrolling interests in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under many of our luxury and premium brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including risks that 1 weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or the tax benefits of mortgage financing or residential ownership generally or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims or claims related to purchaser deposits and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

some hotel openings in our development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels which could adversely affect our growth prospects we report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline including hotels under construction and under signed contracts as well as hotels approved for development but not yet under contract the eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and in particular the approved hotels that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals accordingly we cannot assure you that all of our development pipeline will result in new hotels entering our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

if we incur losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties our profits could decline at times we make loans for hotel development or renovation expenditures when we enter into or amend management or franchise agreements from time to time we also provide thirdparty lenders with financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings we could suffer losses if hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded 

if owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed the owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced if those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all the lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property such sales or repossessions could in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows which could negatively affect our results of operations 

 16 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management property management human resources and payroll systems our loyalty programs  and technologies we make available to our guests and for our associates these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and our business could suffer if we cannot do that as quickly or effectively as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  pricelinecom ®  bookingcom™ travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although our best rate guarantee programs have helped limit guest preference shift to intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract guests including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  yahoo ®  and baidu ®  to steer guests toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although we have successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from our direct online channels or through their fees increase the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels in addition if we fail to reach satisfactory agreements as our contracts with intermediaries come up for periodic renewal our hotels might no longer appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of company employee and guest data   our businesses process use and transmit large volumes of employee and guest data including credit card numbers and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in systems maintained by third parties including our owners franchisees and licensees as well as our service providers in areas such as human resources outsourcing website hosting and various forms of electronic communications the integrity and protection of that guest employee and company data is critical to our business if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions 

our guests and employees also have a high expectation that we as well as our owners franchisees licensees and service providers will adequately protect their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by laws and governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding in the us the european union asia and other jurisdictions where we operate our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners franchisees licensees and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing legal and regulatory requirements and employee and guest expectations or may require significant additional investments or time to do so 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business efforts to hack or breach security measures failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses “ransomware” or other malware operator error or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our information systems and records and those of our owners franchisees licensees or service providers our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access or prevent authorized access to such systems have greatly increased in recent years a significant theft loss loss of access to or fraudulent use of guest employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines or litigation breaches in the security of our information systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits in addition although we carry cyberprivacy liability insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyberattacks security breaches and other related breaches furthermore in the future such insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

changes in privacy and data security laws could increase our operating costs increase our exposure to fines and litigation and adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we are subject to numerous laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information including in the european union asia and other jurisdictions nonus data privacy and data security laws various us federal and state laws credit card industry security standards and other information privacy and security standards are all applicable to us compliance with changes in applicable data privacy 

 17 

laws and regulations and contractual obligations may increase our operating costs increase our exposure to fines and litigation in the event of alleged noncompliance and adversely affect our reputation 

additionally we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international privacy eprivacy and antispam laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential guests from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists were to be prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new guests and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

any disruption in the functioning of our reservation systems as part of our integration of starwood or otherwise could adversely affect our performance and results we manage global reservation systems that communicate reservations to our branded hotels that individuals make directly with us online through our mobile apps through our telephone call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed accuracy and efficiency of our reservation systems are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands our business may suffer if we fail to maintain upgrade or prevent disruption to our reservation systems in addition the risk of disruption in the functioning of our global reservation systems could increase with the anticipated systems integration that is part of our integration of starwood disruptions in or changes to our reservation systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data 

other risks 

changes in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs  we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world including those for financial reporting taxes healthcare cybersecurity privacy climate change and the environment changes to these laws regulations or policies including those associated with health care tax or financial reforms climate change and the environment could reduce our profits we also anticipate that many of the jurisdictions where we do business will continue to review taxes and other revenue raising measures and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices or reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could significantly impact us and other modifications could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our operations or could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured 

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “ 2017 tax act ” which significantly affected us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations the 2017 tax act  requires complex computations not previously required by us tax law as such the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain further compliance with the 2017 tax act  and the accounting for such provisions require preparation and analysis of information not previously required or regularly produced in addition the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in future periods accordingly while we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the 2017 tax act  in our financial statements further regulatory or gaap accounting guidance for the 2017 tax act  our further analysis on the application of the law and refinement of our initial estimates and calculations could materially change our current provisional estimates which could in turn materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses a shortage of skilled labor could also result in higher wages that would increase our labor costs which could reduce our profits 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  under the delaware business combination statute a shareholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the shareholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also 

 18 

among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without shareholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a shareholder rights plan

business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotel residential and timeshare properties in 127  countries and territories under 30  brand names under our business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them we discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments north american fullservice  north american limitedservice  and asia pacific  our europe middle east and africa and caribbean and latin america operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments  

we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us in most markets base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue or certain propertylevel revenue in the case of franchise fees while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return in the middle east and asia incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit house profit less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance real estate taxes and capital spending reserves 

our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while adding new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling our investments maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility 

we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control costs both at companyoperated properties and at the corporate level “aboveproperty” our brands remain strong due to our skilled management teams dedicated associates superior guest service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction significant distribution our loyalty programs  multichannel reservation systems and desirable property amenities we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution 

we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we address through various means hotels in our system that do not meet standards we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse websites and of our associated mobile smartphone applications through functionality and service improvements 

our profitability as well as that of owners and franchisees has benefited from our approach to propertylevel and aboveproperty productivity managed properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls we also control aboveproperty costs some of which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas 

 24 

performance measures   

we believe revpar which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which are components of calculating revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels 

our revpar statistics for 2017  2016  and 2015  include legacystarwood comparable properties for each of the full years even though marriott did not own the legacystarwood brands before the merger date therefore our revpar statistics include legacystarwood properties for periods during which fees from the legacystarwood properties are not included in our income statements we provide these revpar statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue for the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the us dollar the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we define our comparable properties as our properties including those that we acquired through the starwood combination that were open and operating under one of our legacymarriott or legacystarwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year since january 1 2016  for the current period and have not in either the current or previous year i undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions ii been converted between companyoperated and franchised or iii sustained substantial property damage or business interruption for 2017  compared to 2016  we had 3883 comparable north american properties and 1030 comparable international properties for 2016  compared to 2015  we had 3698 comparable north american properties including 483 legacystarwood properties and 965 comparable international properties including 506 legacystarwood properties 

we also believe companyoperated house profit margin which is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit to total propertylevel revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

business trends 

our 2017  fullyear results reflected a yearoveryear increase in the number of properties in our system including those from the starwood combination favorable demand for our brands in many markets around the world and slow but steady economic growth comparable worldwide systemwide revpar for 2017  increased 31 percent  to 11502  adr increased 12 percent  on a constant dollar basis to 15712  and occupancy increased 14  percentage points to 732 percent  compared to 2016  

in north america revpar increased in 2017  partially driven by higher demand in washington dc growth in transient leisure business and favorable citywide events and group business in the fourth quarter revpar was somewhat enhanced by increased demand in impacted areas following the september hurricanes in florida and texas revpar growth was constrained in certain markets by new lodging supply and only moderate gdp growth 

in our asia pacific  segment in 2017 revpar growth was strong in greater china reflecting improved performance in key markets as well as in india and thailand our europe region experienced higher demand in 2017 led by strong transient business in most countries in our middle east and africa region demand continued to be impacted by geopolitical instability political sanctions on qatar and lower oil prices offset by favorable results in south africa growth in the caribbean and latin america regions reflected strength in mexico and improving leisure demand in the caribbean but was partially constrained by weak but improving economic conditions in many markets in south america nine managed and franchised caribbean hotels remained closed at yearend 2017 due to significant damage from hurricanes in the region and we anticipate that two to four of these properties will resume operations in 2018 

we monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels generally adjusting room rates as demand changes our hotels modify the mix of business to improve 

 25 

revenue as demand changes for our companyoperated properties we continue to focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins and making productivity improvements 

in 2017  compared to 2016  at comparable properties worldwide companyoperated house profit margins increased by 80  basis points and worldwide companyoperated house profit per available room “hppar” increased by 54 percent  on a constant us dollar basis reflecting higher revpar improved productivity and procurement and synergy savings north american companyoperated house profit margins increased by 40  basis points and hppar increased by 28 percent  international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 130  basis points and hppar increased by 89 percent  

in the 2017 fourth quarter we reached new multiyear agreements to amend our relationships with jp morgan chase and american express for our usissued cobrand credit cards associated with our loyalty programs  we expect that these agreements will have a favorable impact on our total revenues beginning in 2018 

system growth and pipeline 

in 2017  we added 473  properties with 76589  rooms approximately 39 percent  of the added rooms are located outside north america and 14 percent  are conversions from competitor brands in 2017  69  properties  12952  rooms exited our system 

our global pipeline grew to a record 460000 rooms at yearend 2017 with over half located outside of north america the pipeline includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts and nearly 34000  hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts in 2017 we signed more than 750 management and franchise agreements for new hotels representing nearly 125000 rooms of those room signings nearly 80 percent were in the industry’s three highestquality tiers  luxury upper upscale and upscale  which drive significant revenue per available room and fee revenue contracts signed in 2017 also reflected the growing demand for select service hotels worldwide with a record 578 contracts signed for our classic select and distinctive select brands of which 420 are for hotels in north america and 158 are for hotels located outside of north america 

in 2018  we expect the number of our open hotel rooms will increase approximately 7 percent  gross while room exits will total 1 to 15 percent 

properties and rooms 

at yearend 2017  we operated franchised and licensed the following properties and rooms

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the 2017 tax act  which significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the 2017 tax act  requires complex computations that were not previously required by us tax law significant judgments in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 tax act  and significant estimates in calculations and preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act  will be applied or otherwise administered that differs from our interpretation see footnote 7 “ income taxes ” for further information on the impact of the 2017 tax act  on our 2017 results 

as discussed below and in footnote 7 “ income taxes ” our accounting for the 2017 tax act  is not yet complete as we continue to refine our calculations collect necessary information and monitor developing interpretations as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act  collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional regulatory or accounting guidance we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts we have recorded during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment of the 2017 tax act  that could materially impact our provision for income taxes in the periods in which we make such adjustments although we are not yet able to quantify all impacts of the 2017 tax act  on our 2018 and future results we believe that the overall impact of the 2017 tax act  on our future financial results will be positive we discuss the provisional impact on our 2017 results and the potential impact on our future results further in the paragraphs below 

 33 

reduction of us federal corporate tax rate  the 2017 tax act  reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 in 2017 we recorded a provisional estimated net tax benefit of 159 million from remeasurement of our yearend deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower rate at which we expect they will be realized in the future while we have made a reasonable estimate of the impact of the corporate tax rate reduction that estimate could change as we complete our analyses of all impacts of the 2017 tax act  including but not limited to our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences 

deemed repatriation transition tax  the deemed repatriation transition tax “transition tax” is a new tax on previously untaxed earnings and profits “ep” of certain of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated post1986 through yearend 2017 in addition to us federal income taxes deemed repatriation of such ep under the 2017 tax act  may result in additional state income taxes in some of the us states in which we operate we recorded a provisional estimated transition tax expense of 745 million in 2017 we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the transition tax and our estimate could change when we finalize all necessary calculations 

we estimate that cash payments for the transition tax will total 600 million which is lower than our provisional estimated transition tax expense due to our ability to utilize tax credits that we have carried over from prior years and other adjustments the federal portion of the transition tax is payable over eight years and we estimate that we will pay 578 million as follows 8 percent in each of the years from 2018 to 2022 15 percent in 2023 20 percent in 2024 and 25 percent in 2025 our estimate includes payment of an additional 22 million in state income taxes in 2018 as a result of the 2017 tax act  these amounts could change when we finalize our analysis of the taxability of the ep in the states in which we operate 

state net operating losses and valuation allowances  we must assess whether various aspects of the 2017 tax act  affect our state net operating loss valuation allowances as discussed above we have recorded provisional estimates of state income taxes for certain portions of the 2017 tax act  but we have not completed our analysis for the states where we have net operating loss carryovers and valuation allowances because we have not yet completed our determination of the need for or any change in any valuation allowance we have not recorded any change to our valuation allowances as a result of the 2017 tax act  

other provisions  we continue to evaluate other provisions in the 2017 tax act  including 1 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” a new minimum tax 2 elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” 4 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation and 5 limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the us income tax liability because we have not yet completed our analysis of these provisions we do not have a reasonable estimate of their potential impact if any on our future results 

the impact of the 2017 tax act  and other changes affecting our provision for income taxes are discussed below 



2017  compared to 2016 

provision for income taxes increase d by 1060 million  primarily due to the 2017 tax act  586 million the gain on the sale of our interest in avendra 259 million higher earnings due to the inclusion of legacystarwood operations for the full year 2017 244 million lower mergerrelated costs 86 million an unfavorable comparison to the 2016 release of a valuation allowance 15 million the gain on the disposition of a north american fullservice property 9 million and a change in judgment regarding the realizability of certain deferred tax assets in certain states and foreign jurisdictions 7 million the increase was partially offset by tax benefits from the adoption of asu 201609 72 million tax law changes in nonus jurisdictions 22 million change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings 26 million the reversal of tax reserves related to interest accrued for previous periods 15 million and adjustments resulting from finalizing prior years’ returns 10 million 

2016  compared to 2015 

provision for income taxes increased by 8 million  driven by 4 million from the starwood combination and the following legacymarriott drivers tax rate changes in several jurisdictions 12 million higher earnings from foreign operations 6 million and an unfavorable comparison to 2015 us and foreign trueups 5 million partially offset by lower us earnings due to mergerrelated expenses 11 million and the release of a valuation allowance 8 million

new accounting standards 

see footnote 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” for information on our anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facility   

we are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement the “credit facility” that provides for up to 4000 million of aggregate effective borrowings to support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures share repurchases letters of credit and acquisitions borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating while any outstanding commercial paper borrowings andor borrowings under our credit facility generally have shortterm maturities we classify the outstanding borrowings as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a longterm basis the credit facility expires on june 10 2021   

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations remain adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

we issue commercial paper in the us we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings if the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2017  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 2010 million  and reflected borrowing capacity of 1627 million  under our credit facility and our cash balance of 383 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 4000 million  of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting 2373 million  of outstanding commercial paper there being no  outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings issuances of senior notes and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations but which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

 38 

cash from operations 

cash from operations and noncash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 05  to 10 at yearend 2017  and 07  to 10 at yearend 2016  we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which we detail in exhibit 12 to this 2017  annual report on form 10k are as follows 



for 2018 we plan to invest in our workforce by offering an additional onetime contribution to our retirement savings plans structured as a 5to1 company match of up to 1000 we expect the vast majority of participating associates would receive this incremental company contribution this contribution will be available to eligible associates at companyoperated hotels as well as those in corporate and regional offices in the us we also expect to invest in global associate support programs we estimate an overall cost of 140 million for these investments in our workforce with approximately 70 million of that amount coming from proceeds from the 2017 sale of our interest in avendra 

investing activities cash flows 

acquisition of a business net of cash acquired cash outflows of 2412 million  in 2016  were due to the starwood combination see footnote 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 240 million  in 2017  199 million  in 2016  and 305 million  in 2015  capital expenditures in 2017   increased  by 41 million  compared to 2016  primarily due to improvements to our worldwide systems and improvements to hotels acquired in the starwood combination capital expenditures in 2016   decreased  by 106 million  compared to 2015  primarily due to lower spending for our edition hotels 

we expect 2018  investment spending will total approximately 600 million  to 700 million  including approximately 225 million  for maintenance capital spending consolidated investment spending also includes other capital expenditures including property acquisitions loan advances contract acquisition costs and equity and other investments 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations in the starwood combination we acquired various hotels and joint venture interests in hotels many of which we have sold or are seeking to sell we also expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include new construction loans guarantees and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because 1 we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated 1418 million  cash proceeds in 2017  and 218 million  in 2016  see footnote 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan collections net of loan advances amounted to 94 million  in 2017  compared to net collections of 35 million  in 2016  at yearend 2017  we had 149 million  of senior mezzanine and other loans outstanding compared to 248 million  outstanding at yearend 2016  

 39 

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 63 million  in 2017  14 million  in 2016  and 7 million  in 2015  for equity and cost method investments primarily reflect our investments in several joint ventures 

financing activities cash flows 

debt debt decreased  by 268 million  in 2017  to 8238 million  at yearend 2017  from 8506 million  at yearend 2016  primarily due to 293 million in series i notes that matured in the 2017 second quarter partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings see footnote 11  “ longterm debt ” for additional information on the debt issuances 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2017  our longterm debt had a weighted average interest rate of 29 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 50 years the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 07 to 10 at yearend 2017  

see the “ cash requirements and our credit facility ” caption in this “liquidity and capital resources” section for more information on our credit facility 

share repurchases we purchased 292 million shares of our common stock in 2017  at an average price of 10366  per share 80 million  shares in 2016  at an average price of 7155  per share and 257 million  shares in 2015  at an average price of 7548  per share at yearend 2017  322 million  shares remained available for repurchase under board approved authorizations for additional information see “ fourth quarter 2017 issuer purchases of equity securities ” in part ii item 5

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if 1 we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

while we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made actual results may differ significantly additionally changes in our assumptions estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

see footnote 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” for further information related our critical accounting policies and estimates which are as follows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates stock prices currency exchange rates and debt prices we manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floatingrate notes receivable and floatingrate debt changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixedrate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt 

we are also subject to risk from changes in debt prices from our investments in debt securities and fluctuations in stock price from our investment in a publicly traded company changes in the price of the underlying stock can impact the fair value of our investment we account for our investments as availableforsale securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 

we use derivative instruments including cash flow hedges net investment in nonus operations hedges and other derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates as a matter of policy we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes see footnote 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” for more information on derivative instruments

terms of our management agreements vary but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a percentage of annual revenues in excess of a fixed amount many of our operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners a large number of our operating agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies in certain circumstances some of our management agreements allow owners to convert companyoperated properties to franchised properties under our brands 

for lodging facilities that we operate we generally are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees who are needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs we provide centralized reservation services and national advertising marketing and promotional services as well as various accounting and data processing services and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs

we have franchising licensing and joint venture programs that permit other hotel owners and operators and two timeshare companies to use many of our lodging brand names and systems under our hotel franchising programs we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees which typically range from four to six percent of room revenues for all brands plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain fullservice hotels we are a partner in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage and in some cases own hotels some of these joint ventures also provide services to franchised hotels we recognize our share of these joint ventures’ net income or loss in the “equity in earnings” caption of our income statements franchisees and certain joint ventures contribute to our national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems 

we also receive royalty fees under license agreements with marriott vacations worldwide corporation “mvw” our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011 and vistana signature experiences inc “vistana” a subsidiary of interval leisure group inc “ilg” which acquired starwood’s vacation timeshare operations before the merger date mvw is the worldwide developer marketer and seller of vacation ownership and related products under the marriott vacation club grand residences by marriott and the ritzcarlton destination club brands vistana is the worldwide developer marketer seller and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the westin and sheraton brands and under the st regis and the luxury collection brands for certain existing properties we receive license fees from both mvw and vistana consisting of a fixed annual fee adjusted for inflation plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes

residential 

we use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate typically in conjunction with hotel development and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others thirdparty owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk we have used or licensed our jw marriott the ritzcarlton the ritzcarlton reserve w hotels the luxury collection st regis edition bulgari hotels  resorts marriott hotels sheraton westin and autograph collection hotels  brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales while the worldwide residential market is very large we believe the luxurious nature of our residential properties the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands and the hospitality services that we provide all serve to make residential properties bearing our trademarks distinctive

seasonality 

in general business at companyoperated and franchised properties fluctuates only moderately with the seasons and is relatively stable business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location

at yearend 2016  we operated franchised or licensed properties in the following geographical regions

 other activities 

credit card programs    at yearend 2016  we licensed 13 credit card programs in the united states canada united kingdom united arab emirates and japan which include marriott rewards the ritzcarlton rewards and starwood preferred guest “spg” credit cards we earn licensing fees based on card usage and the cards are designed to encourage loyalty to our brands 

loyalty programs sales and marketing and reservation systems  our customer loyalty programs marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards and spg collectively “ loyalty programs ” have 30 participating brands mvw vistana and other program partners also participate in one or more of our loyalty programs  the loyalty programs  yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 49 participating airline programs we believe that our loyalty programs  generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2016  loyalty programs  members purchased over 50 percent of our room nights while we continue to run our loyalty programs  in parallel we encourage the linking of accounts between the loyalty programs  allowing instant elite status match and enabling the transfer of points between the programs we continue to enhance our loyalty program offerings and strategically market to this large and growing customer base our loyalty member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts see the “ loyalty programs ” caption in footnote 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” for more information 

marriottcom starwoodhotelscom spgcom our international sites and our mobile apps continued to grow significantly in 2016 our web and mobile platforms allow for a seamless booking experience and enable our guests to easily enroll in our loyalty programs  and book our exclusive member rates our look no further ®  best rate guarantee ensures best rate integrity strengthening consumer confidence in our brand and gives customers access to the same rates when they book through our various direct channels we also continue to grow engagement levels with millions of customers through our mobile guest services in addition to existing mobile services like mobile checkin and checkout in 2016 we expanded to add mobile service requests now offered at many hotel brands around the globe enabling guests to engage in a twoway chat with the hotel before their arrival and throughout their stay our digital strategy continues to focus on creating a simple and efficient digital booking experience and to create a superior and memorable stay experience for our guests powered by digital guest services across our hotel portfolio 

at yearend 2016  we operated 24  hotel reservation centers nine  in the united states and canada and 15  in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own two  of the us facilities and either lease the others or share space with an existing marriott property while pricing is 

 8 

set by our hotels our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and franchisees and enhance our fee revenue 

we believe our global sales and revenue management organization is a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people processes and systems our aboveproperty sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around the customer reducing duplication of sales efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts we also utilize innovative sophisticated revenue management systems many of which are proprietary which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increase efficiency in analysis and decision making and produce higher propertylevel revenue for the hotels in our system most of the hotels in our system utilize webbased programs to effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

as we further discuss in part i item 1a “risk factors” later in this report we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation revenue management and property management systems in our loyalty programs  and in other aspects of our business we also make certain technologies available to our guests keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position furthermore the integrity and protection of customer employee and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency 

environmental responsibility and sustainable hotels  our sustainability strategy supports business growth conservation of natural resources and protecting our planet through widereaching environmental initiatives marriott’s environmental goals are to 1 reduce energy and water consumption by 20 percent from 2007 to 2020 2 empower our hotel development partners to build sustainable hotels 3 green our multibillion dollar supply chain 4 educate and inspire associates and guests to conserve and preserve and 5 address environmental challenges through innovative conservation initiatives including rainforest protection and water conservation 

we recognize our responsibility to reduce waste as well as water and energy consumption in our hotels and corporate offices our focus remains on continually integrating greater environmental sustainability throughout our business in the year ahead we intend to build upon our progress and launch our next generation of sustainability goals we were the first major hotel chain to calculate our carbon footprint and launch a plan to improve energy efficiency conserve water and support globally significant projects that reduce deforestation we use energy and environmental action plans to help our properties achieve energy and water reduction goals working in partnership with the us green building council’s leadership in energy and environmental design leed® certification marriott is empowering our hotel development partners to build sustainable hotels marriott has one of the largest portfolios of leedcertified buildings in the hospitality industry with 111 certified properties and over 180 more in the development pipeline 

global design division  our global design division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors global design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor according to lodging industry data there are approximately 1044 lodging management companies in the united states including approximately 20 that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria 

during the last recession demand for hotel rooms declined significantly particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2016 cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction in order to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2016  approximately 60 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system in the franchising business we face a number of competitors that have 

 9 

strong brands and customer appeal including hilton intercontinental hotels group hyatt wyndham accor choice carlson rezidor best western la quinta and others 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers decline international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have more than a 14 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a four percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to customer preference across all of our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

employee relations 

at yearend 2016  we had approximately 226500 employees approximately 23000 of whom were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation and development of properties complies in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statement the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forwardlooking statements contained in this report or in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties and home and apartment sharing services for customers  we operate in markets that contain many competitors each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains as well as home and apartment sharing services in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty programs and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline further new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets 

economic uncertainty could continue to impact our financial results and growth  weak economic conditions in some parts of the world the strength or continuation of recovery in countries that have experienced improved economic conditions changes in oil prices and currency values potential disruptions in the us economy that might result from the new us administration’s policies in such areas as trade immigration healthcare and related issues political instability in some areas and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions will continue could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging industry us government travel is also a significant part of our business and this aspect of our business may continue to suffer due to us federal spending cuts or government hiring freezes and any further limitations that may result from presidential or congressional action or inaction as a result of such current economic conditions and uncertainty we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets recent improvements in demand trends in other markets may not continue and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery stalls or conditions worsen 

risks relating to our integration of starwood 

the diversion of resources and management’s attention to the integration of starwood could adversely affect our daytoday business  the integration of starwood places a significant burden on our management and internal resources the diversion of management’s attention away from daytoday business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results 

we may not be able to integrate starwood successfully and many of the anticipated benefits of combining starwood and marriott may not be realized we decided to acquire starwood with the expectation that the starwood combination will result in various benefits including among other things operating efficiencies achieving those anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether we can integrate the business of starwood in an efficient and effective manner and we cannot assure you that those benefits will be realized at all or as quickly as we expect if we do not achieve those benefits our costs could increase our expected net income could decrease and our future business financial condition operating results and prospects could suffer 

 11 

the integration process could take longer than we anticipate and involve unanticipated costs disruptions of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements could adversely affect the combined company we may also have difficulty addressing differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and in harmonizing our different reservations and other systems and business practices although we expect that the elimination of certain duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will over time offset the substantial incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs and charges we incurred in connection with the starwood combination we may not achieve this net benefit in the near term or at all 

our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations with completion of the starwood combination the size of our business has increased significantly our continued success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which poses substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits from the combination that we currently anticipate 

we may not be able to retain legacystarwood personnel successfully the success of the starwood combination will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key legacystarwood employees it remains possible that these employees may decide not to remain with us if key legacystarwood employees who we would like to retain terminate their employment the loss of institutional knowledge and key business relationships could cause our business to suffer 

risks relating to our business 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which we fail or elect not to cure in addition some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have interpreted hotel management agreements as “personal services contracts” this means among other things that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future in addition some management and franchise agreements may be terminated or property owners may attempt to terminate such agreements in connection with the starwood combination if terminations occur for these or other reasons we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

our lodging operations are subject to global regional and national conditions  because we conduct our business on a global platform changes in global and regional economies impact our activities in recent years decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism have hurt our business our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic environment in each of our operating regions the resulting unknown pace of business travel and any future incidents or changes in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the united states including as a result of the starwood combination makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation   at yearend 2016 we operated or franchised hotels and resorts in 122  countries and territories with the acquisition of starwood the hotels we operate or franchise outside of the united states represented more than 36  percent of the rooms in our system at yearend 2016  we expect that our international operations and resulting revenues will continue to grow as a result we are increasingly exposed to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the united states many of which are outside of our control and which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions otherwise disrupt our business or damage our reputation these challenges include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and government policies that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as competition laws currency regulations and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax effective manner or in some cases at all due to foreign exchange restrictions 4 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 5 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and 

 12 

intellectual property rights under local laws 6 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest in the middle east and elsewhere acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 7 currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact the results and cash flows of our international operations 

any failure by our international operations to comply with anticorruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs reduce our profits limit our growth harm our reputation or subject us to broader liability we are subject to restrictions imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and anticorruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations such as the uk bribery act anticorruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons in order to receive or retain business these laws also require us to maintain adequate internal controls and accurate books and records as a result of the starwood combination we now have more properties in countries outside of the us including in many parts of the world where corruption is common and our compliance with anticorruption laws may potentially conflict with local customs and practices the compliance programs internal controls and policies we and prior to the merger date starwood maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws may not prevent our associates contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations we are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and the us department of commerce our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules the united states may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected any violations of anticorruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties reduce our profits disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation or result in lawsuits being brought against the company or its officers or directors in addition the operation of these laws or an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities or cease operations in certain countries that would otherwise support growth 

in connection with the starwood combination we are currently assessing various regulatory compliance matters at several foreign legacystarwood locations including compliance with the fcpa the results of this assessment may give rise to contingencies that could require us to record balance sheet liabilities or accrue expenses the amounts of which we are not able to currently estimate 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the united states accordingly fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues we are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our business outside of the us are generally reported in local currency which we then translate to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results we expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our nonus operations increases our efforts to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in which we receive management and franchise fees may not be successful in this regard these hedging agreements do not cover all currencies in which we do business do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

some of our management agreements and related contracts require us to make payments to owners if the hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit  some of our contracts with hotel owners require that we fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit we may not be able to recover any fundings of such performance guarantees which could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful  we cannot assure you that recently launched newly acquired or recently announced brands such as edition ac hotels by marriott in the americas protea hotels moxy hotels delta hotels and those we acquired as a result of the starwood combination or any other new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other customers we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products or that the brands or any new programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new or newly acquired brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

 13 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other natural disasters such as hurricane sandy in the northeastern united states the earthquake and tsunami in japan and manmade disasters in recent years as well as the potential spread of contagious diseases such as mers middle east respiratory syndrome zika virus and ebola in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers could cause a decline in business or leisure travel and reduce demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest or civil strife such as recent events in fort lauderdale orlando charlotte berlin brussels paris turkey ukraine and russia the middle east and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or may delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product service or systems initiatives the timing and amount of capital investments and reimbursement for certain system initiatives and costs such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but we are not always able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations  events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands if the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be affected 

if our brands goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record significant noncash charges to earnings  as of december 31 2016  we had 169 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets including 65 billion  attributable to the legacystarwood brands based on the preliminary purchase accounting for the starwood combination a significant increase over the 24 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets we had as of december 31 2015  the amount of goodwill acquired in the starwood combination could increase over the year following the acquisition if we determine that the value of physical assets acquired is less than or the amount of liabilities assumed including under starwood’s guest loyalty program is greater than we preliminarily estimated we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred estimated fair values of our brands or reporting units could change if for example there are changes in the business climate unanticipated changes in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in customers’ perception of and the reputation of the legacystarwood brands or changes in interest rates operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties in connection with lodging timeshare residential services and our credit card programs under the terms of their agreements with us our franchisees and licensees interact directly with customers and other third parties under our brand and trade names if these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems including any data breach involving customer information or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances pursuing any such recourse remedy or termination could be expensive and time consuming  in addition we cannot assure you that a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights in every instance 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance  we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed leased and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary and require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we or our franchisees can obtain or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as 

 14 

earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of any capital that we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations for the property 

development and financing risks 

while  w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary  in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control the difficulty of obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we develop new hotel and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in 2015 and 2014 in connection with our development and construction of three edition hotels and residences our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion 

our owned properties and other real estate investments subject us to numerous risks  although we had relatively few owned and leased properties at the end of 2016 we acquired significant numbers of those properties as part of the starwood combination and such properties are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property although we intend to sell most of our owned and leased properties over the next two years equity real estate investments can be difficult to sell quickly and we may not be able to do so at prices we find acceptable or at all moreover the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties and the expenses incurred a variety of other factors also affect income from properties and real estate values including governmental regulations insurance zoning tax and eminent domain laws interest rate levels and the availability of financing for example new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive andor timeconsuming to develop real property or expand modify or renovate hotels when interest rates increase the cost of acquiring developing expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases similarly as financing becomes less available it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property finally under eminent domain laws governments can take real property sometimes this taking is for less 

 15 

compensation than the owner believes the property is worth despite our assetlight strategy our real estate properties could be impacted by any of these factors resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition if our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses including needed capital expenditures our income will be adversely affected 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks  partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties which we have entered into or acquired as part of the starwood combination generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments 

investing through partnerships or joint ventures decreases our ability to manage risk  in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly starwood and to the lesser extent marriott has from time to time invested and we may continue to invest as a coventurer such arrangements often have shared control over the operation of the assets therefore such investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the coventurer might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations should a venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for our partner’s share of venture’s liabilities also our venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or may make requests contrary to our policies or objectives further we may be unable to take action without the approval of our venture partners and alternatively our venture partners could take actions binding on the venture or partnership without our consent therefore actions by a coventurer might subject the assets owned by the venture or partnership to additional risk we cannot assure you that our investments through partnerships or joint ventures will be successful despite these risks 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate directly or through noncontrolling interests andor licensing agreements in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under our jw marriott the ritzcarlton the ritzcarlton reserve w hotels the luxury collection st regis edition bulgari hotels  resorts marriott hotels sheraton westin and autograph collection hotels  brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 1 weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

some hotel openings in our existing development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels which could adversely affect our growth prospects we report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline including hotels under construction and under signed contracts as well as hotels approved for development but not yet under signed contracts the eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and in particular the hotels approved for development that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals accordingly we cannot assure you that our development pipeline and in particular hotels not yet under contract will result in new hotels that enter our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

if we incur losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties our profits could decline at times we make loans for hotel development or renovation expenditures in connection with entering into or amending management or franchise agreements from time to time we also provide thirdparty lenders financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings we could suffer losses if hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded 

if owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed the owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced if those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all the 

 16 

lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property such sales or repossessions could in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows which could negatively affect our results of operations 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our loyalty programs  and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  pricelinecom ®  bookingcom™ travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s and starwood’s respective best rate guarantee programs have helped prevent customer preference shift to the intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  yahoo ®  and baidu ®  to steer customers toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from marriott and starwood direct online channels or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels in addition if we fail to reach satisfactory agreements with intermediaries as our contracts with them come up for periodic renewal our hotels might no longer appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of internal and customer data   our businesses process use and transmit large volumes of internal employee and customer data including credit card numbers and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties including our owners franchisees and licensees as well as our service providers in areas such as human resources outsourcing website hosting and various forms of electronic communications the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to our business if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions 

our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we as well as our owners franchisees licensees and service providers will adequately protect their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding in both the united states and other jurisdictions where we operate our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners franchisees licensees and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and employee and customer expectations or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business efforts to hack or breach security measures failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses operator error or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our including our owners’ franchisees’ licensees’ or service providers’ information systems and records our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to such systems have increased significantly in recent years a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines or litigation breaches in the security of our information systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits in addition although we carry cyberprivacy liability insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyberattacks security breaches and other related breaches furthermore in the future such insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

changes in privacy law could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we are subject to numerous laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information 

 17 

including foreign data protection laws various us federal and state laws and credit card industry security standards and other applicable information privacy and security standards compliance with changes in applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs 

additionally we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

any disruption in the functioning of our reservation system such as in connection with our integration of starwood could adversely affect our performance and results we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels that individuals make directly with us online through our mobile app or through our telephone call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed accuracy and efficiency of our reservation system are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands our business may suffer if we fail to maintain upgrade or prevent disruption to our reservation system in addition the risk of disruption in the functioning of our global reservation system could increase in connection with the system integration that we anticipate undertaking as part of our integration of starwood disruptions in or changes to our reservation system could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data 

other risks 

changes in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs  we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world including those for financial reporting taxes healthcare and the environment changes to these laws regulations or policies including those associated with health care tax or financial reforms could reduce our profits we also anticipate that many of the jurisdictions where we do business will continue to review taxes and other revenue raising measures and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices or reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could significantly impact us including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our nonus operations or that could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured for example most us company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the united states is generally taxed at local rates which are often much lower than us tax rates if changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations significantly increase the tax rates on nonus income our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced if such increases resulted from our status as a us company those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our nonus competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses any shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase our labor costs which could reduce our profits 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  under the delaware business combination statute a shareholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the shareholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without shareholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a shareholder rights plan

business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 122  countries and territories under 30  brand names we also develop operate and market residential properties and provide services to homecondominium owner associations under our business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them we group our operations into three  business segments north american fullservice  north american limitedservice  and international  

we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us in most markets base fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return in the middle east and asia incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit house profit less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance real estate taxes and capital spending reserves 

our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while adding new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility 

we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control costs both at companyoperated properties and at the corporate level “aboveproperty” our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams dedicated associates superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction significant distribution our loyalty programs  a multichannel reservations system and desirable property amenities we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution 

we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we address through various means hotels in our system that do not meet standards we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse websites and of our associated mobile smartphone applications through functionality and service improvements and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of propertylevel reservations via this costefficient channel 

our profitability as well as that of owners and franchisees has benefited from our approach to propertylevel and aboveproperty productivity properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls we also control aboveproperty costs some of which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas

acquisition of starwood hotels  resorts worldwide 

on the merger date we completed the starwood combination our income statements reflect a net loss of 39 million  for starwood’s results of operations for the period from september 23 2016  to december 31 2016  including mergerrelated costs and charges net of tax of 194 million  the combination of our brands creates a more comprehensive portfolio enhances our global market distribution and provides opportunities for cost efficiencies our combined company now operates or franchises over 6000  properties with nearly 12 million  rooms see footnote 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information 

performance measures   

we believe revenue per available room “revpar” which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which are components of calculating revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels 

our revpar statistics for 2016 and for 2016 compared to 2015 include legacystarwood comparable properties for both full years even though marriott did not own the legacystarwood brands before the starwood combination  therefore our revpar statistics include legacystarwood properties for periods during which fees from the legacystarwood properties are not included in our income statements we provide these revpar statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue our revpar statistics for 2015 and for 2015 compared to 2014 are for legacymarriott comparable properties only as marriott did not own the legacystarwood brands at any time during that twoyear period  for the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the us dollar the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we define our comparable properties as our properties including those that we acquired through the starwood combination that were open and operating under one of our legacymarriott or legacystarwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year since january 1 2015 for the current period and have not in either the current or previous year i undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions ii been converted between companyoperated and franchised or iii sustained substantial property damage or business interruption for 2016 compared to 2015 we had 3698 comparable north american properties including 483 legacystarwood properties and 965 comparable international properties including 506 legacystarwood properties for 2015 compared to 2014 we had 3077 comparable north american properties and 367 comparable international properties 

we also believe companyoperated house profit margin which is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit to total propertylevel revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

business trends 

our 2016  results reflected a yearoveryear increase in the number of properties in our system favorable demand for our brands in many markets around the world and slow but steady economic growth comparable worldwide systemwide revpar for 2016  increased 18 percent  to 11350  adr increased 10 percent  on a constant dollar basis to 15653  and occupancy increased 06  percentage points to 725 percent  compared to 2015  

in north america 2016  lodging demand for our brands reflected increased transient business driven by higher retail and government travel but weaker premiumpriced corporate transient demand group business was higher in most of 2016 compared to 2015 revenue growth was constrained in certain markets by new lodging supply weak demand from the oil and gas industries the impact of the strong dollar on international travel to us gateway markets and moderate gdp growth the 2017  group revenue pace for systemwide fullservice hotels in north america was up more than two percent as of yearend 2016  compared to the 2016  group pace measured as of yearend 2015  

 25 

our europe region experienced higher demand in 2016 across most countries led by spain portugal and russia partially constrained by weaker demand in france belgium and turkey following terrorism events in those countries in our asia pacific region in 2016 revpar growth was strong in india and thailand while revpar growth in china was constrained in hong kong and certain southern and tertiary china markets middle east demand continued to be impacted by geopolitical instability oversupply in dubai and qatar and lower oil prices in south africa results were favorable in 2016 reflecting strong local demand and higher international tourism attracted by the weak south african rand in the caribbean and latin america growth from strong demand in mexico and the summer olympic games in rio de janeiro was offset by concerns relating to the zika virus in the caribbean and weak economic conditions in most markets in south america 

we monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels generally adjusting room rates as demand changes our hotels modify the mix of business to improve revenue as demand changes for our companyoperated properties we continue to focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins and making productivity improvements 

compared to 2015  worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins in 2016  increased by 50  basis points and worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit per available room “hppar” increased by 27 percent  on a constant us dollar basis reflecting higher occupancy rate increases improved productivity and solid cost controls primarily at our legacymarriott properties north american companyoperated house profit margins increased by 70  basis points and hppar at those properties increased by 44 percent  international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 20  basis points and hppar at those properties increased by 07 percent  compared to 2015 

system growth and pipeline 

in 2016  we added 348  properties with 55321  rooms in addition to the 1342  properties and 381440  rooms gained with the starwood combination on the merger date approximately 40 percent  of the added rooms are located outside north america and 18 percent   are conversions from competitor brands of the rooms gained with the starwood combination approximately 50 percent  are located outside north america in 2016  34  properties  5691  rooms exited our system 

at the end of 2016 including rooms under legacystarwood brands we had more than 420000  hotel rooms in our development pipeline which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts and nearly 34000  hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts more than half of the rooms in our development pipeline are outside north america 

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of our consolidated revenues operating income and nonoperating income for 2016 2015 and 2014 in accordance with gaap we include the business that we acquired in the starwood combination starting from the merger date through yearend 2016 

revenues 

2016 compared to 2015    the table below presents the impact of the starwood combination starting from the merger date with additional information on the factors attributable to our legacymarriott brands discussed following the table   

the 5 million   increase  in base management fees  for legacymarriott operations  primarily reflected the impact of stronger sales at existing properties 22 million and unit growth across our system 15 million partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 15 million lower deferred fee recognition 11 million and lower fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised 8 million 

 30 

the 48 million   increase  in franchise fees  for legacymarriott operations  reflected the impact of unit growth across our system 48 million stronger sales at existing properties 16 million and higher fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised 11 million partially offset by lower relicensing fees 22 million and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 7 million 

the 34 million   increase  in incentive management fees  for legacymarriott operations  reflected higher net house profit and unit growth higher incentive fees earned from a few limitedservice portfolios 10 million and higher deferred fee recognition 8 million partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 7 million 

in 2016  69 percent  of our legacymarriott managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 68 percent  in 2015  in north america 65 percent  of legacymarriott managed properties paid incentive fees in 2016  compared to 63 percent  in 2015  outside north america 74 percent  of legacymarriott managed properties paid incentive fees in both 2016  and 2015  representing 48 percent  of our total incentive management fees in 2016  from legacymarriott managed properties compared to 51 percent  of our total fees in 2015  

the 25 million   increase  in owned leased and other revenue  for legacymarriott operations  reflected 38 million of higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees partially offset by 13 million of lower owned and leased revenue the decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected lower revenues from properties that converted to managed 60 million and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 15 million partially offset by improved sales from several properties following renovations 29 million stronger sales at other existing properties across our segments 28 million and favorable results at two new owned properties 9 million 

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs such as those associated with our loyalty programs  reservations and marketing programs as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income the 568 million   increase  in cost reimbursements revenue  for legacymarriott operations  reflected the impact of higher property occupancies unit growth across our system and growth in the marriott rewards program membership and activity 

2015 compared to 2014   the following discussion presents our analysis of our revenues for 2015  compared to 2014  

the 26 million increase in base management fees reflected stronger revpar 29 million and the impact of unit growth across our system 25 million   partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 11 million lower fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised 7 million and decreased recognition of previously deferred fees 8 million 

the 108 million increase in total franchise fees reflected the impact of unit growth across our system 55 million stronger revpar due to increased demand 31 million increased relicensing and application fees 22 million and higher fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed 7 million partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 7 million 

the 17 million increase in incentive management fees reflected higher revpar and house profit margins primarily at companymanaged north american properties particularly at a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees higher incentive fees also reflected the addition of hotels included in the delta hotels acquisition partially offset by 15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and 7 million of lower incentive fees from properties under renovation

percentage of north american properties that paid incentive management fees to us increased compared to 2014 primarily due to a few large north american limitedservice portfolios of properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 but did not do so in 2014 in addition in 2015 51 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of north america versus 56 percent in 2014

depreciation amortization and other expense  for legacymarriott operations   decrease d by 14 million  the decrease  primarily reflected a favorable variance to the 2015 impairment charges on the edition hotels 12 million and corporate equipment 4 million 

general administrative and other expenses  for legacymarriott operations   decrease d by 9 million  the decrease  primarily reflected 15 million in lower reserves for guarantee funding and 9 million in lower foreign exchange losses partially offset by 15 million of higher administrative costs to grow our brands globally 4 million of higher bad debt reserves and 3 million net unfavorable impact to our legal expenses associated with 2015 litigation resolutions

the 6 million increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses was largely attributable to 4 million in higher branding fees owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses was unchanged as stronger results at several of our international properties including 4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed franchised or left our system were offset by 10 million of weaker performance due to renovations 

the 9 million decrease in depreciation amortization and other expense reflected a 25 million favorable variance to the 2014 impairment charge on the edition hotels partially offset by the 2015 impairment charges of 6 million for the miami beach edition residences and 6 million for the new york madison square park edition and a 4 million impairment charge on corporate equipment

nonoperating income expense and income taxes 

2016  compared to 2015  the table below presents the impact of the starwood combination starting from the merger date with additional information on the factors attributable to our legacymarriott brands discussed following the table 



gains and other income net  for legacymarriott operations   decrease d by 23 million  primarily due to the net gain that we recorded in the prior year which consisted of a 41 million gain on the redemption of a preferred equity ownership interest partially offset by an 11 million disposal loss for an international property and a 4 million disposal loss for a north american limitedservice segment plot of land 

interest expense  for legacymarriott operations  including interest expense on debt incurred for the starwood combination increase d by 52 million  the increase  was primarily due to a net increase in senior notes interest expense 18 million from the issuances of series q through w notes in 2016 and series o and p notes in 2015 partially offset by the maturities of series h notes in 2016 and series g notes in 2015 the remaining increase is primarily due to the amortization of costs for a bridge term loan facility commitment that we obtained in the 2016 first quarter 13 million net lower capitalized interest primarily as a result of the completion of the new york madison square park edition in 2015 9 million and higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings 7 million 

interest income  for legacymarriott operations   increase d by 4 million  primarily due to higher interest income on a loan that we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for a north american limitedservice property in the 2015 fourth quarter 8 million partially offset by lower interest income on two repaid loans 6 million 

equity in earnings  for legacymarriott operations   decrease d by 11 million  primarily reflecting a net unfavorable variance to three adjustments recorded in 2015 which consisted of a reversal of a litigation reserve 11 million and a 

 33 

reduction of an international investee’s liabilities 5 million partially offset by an impairment charge on an international joint venture 6 million 

provision for income taxes  for legacymarriott operations   increased  by 4 million  primarily due to tax rate changes in several jurisdictions 12 million higher earnings from foreign operations 6 million and an unfavorable comparison to 2015 us and foreign trueups 5 million partially offset by lower us earnings due to mergerrelated expenses 11 million and the release of a valuation allowance 8 million 

2015  compared to 2014  the following discussion presents our analysis of our revenues for 2015  compared to 2014  



gains and other income net increased by 19 million the increase primarily reflects the 41 million gain on the redemption of our preferred equity ownership interest the increase was partially offset by an 11 million disposal loss for an international property and a 4 million expected disposal loss for a north american limitedservice segment plot of land 

interest expense increased by 52 million the increase was due to net lower capitalized interest expense as a result of the completion of the miami beach edition in the 2014 fourth quarter and the new york madison square park edition in the 2015 second quarter 25 million interest on the series o notes and series p notes that we issued in the 2015 third quarter and the series n notes that we issued in the 2014 fourth quarter 17 million and an unfavorable variance to the 2014 debt premium accretion trueup 7 million 

interest income decreased by 1 million this decrease was primarily due to lower interest income on the preferred equity ownership interest that was redeemed in the 2015 second quarter 5 million partially offset by higher interest income on the 85 million mezzanine loan net of a 15 million discount we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property in the 2014 second quarter 5 million 

equity in earnings increased by 10 million the increase reflects a 22 million yearoveryear impact from the reversal in 2015 of an 11 million litigation reserve that was recorded in 2014 and associated with an equity investment and a 5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an international investee’s liabilities the increase was partially offset by a 6 million impairment charge relating to an international joint venture and an unfavorable variance to a 9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our international investments following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate 

our provision for income taxes increased by 61 million the increase was primarily due to higher pretax earnings and unfavorable comparisons to the 2014 resolution of a us federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program the 2014 release of an international valuation allowance and the 2014 resolution of an international financing activity tax issue the increase was partially offset by a favorable irs settlement relating to sharebased compensation 12 million a tax benefit from an international property disposition 7 million and a favorable comparison to the 2014 tax on unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction 5 million

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

in the 2016 second quarter we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement the “credit facility” to extend the maturity date of the credit facility and increase the aggregate amount of available borrowings to up to 4000 million up to 2500 million of which was initially available with the full 4000 million becoming available to us with the closing of the starwood combination the availability of the credit facility supports our commercial paper program and general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures share repurchases letters of credit and acquisitions in addition we used borrowings under the credit facility all of which we later repaid to finance part of the cash component of the consideration we paid to starwood shareholders and certain fees and expenses we incurred in connection with the starwood combination borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating the term of the facility expires on june 10 2021 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” giving pro forma effect for certain material acquisitions each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 in connection with the starwood combination we exercised our option to temporarily increase the maximum permitted leverage under the credit facility to 45 to 1 for the 2016 third and fourth quarters and the 2017 first quarter our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility expect to continue to do so once the temporary increase in permitted leverage ends and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations remain adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

we issue commercial paper in the united states we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2016  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 2545 million  and reflected borrowing capacity of 1687 million  under our credit facility and our cash balance of 858 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 4000 million  of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting 2313 million  of outstanding commercial paper there being no  outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings issuances of senior notes and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly

cash from operations 

cash from operations and noncash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 07  to 10 at yearend 2016  and 04 to 10 at yearend 2015  we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which we detail in exhibit 12 to this 2016  annual report on form 10k are as follows 



investing activities cash flows 

acquisition of a business net of cash acquired cash outflows of 2412 million  in 2016  reflect cash consideration to starwood shareholders net of cash acquired in the starwood combination cash outflows of 137 million  in 2015  primarily reflect the acquisition of delta hotels see footnote 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 199 million  in 2016  305 million  in 2015  and 411 million  in 2014  these included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives capital expenditures in 2016  decreased by 106 million  compared to 2015  primarily due to lower spending for our edition hotels capital expenditures in 2015  decreased by 106 million  compared to 2014  primarily related to the 2014 development of two edition hotels partially offset by 2015 renovations at a north american fullservice property and investments in our reservations system 

we expect 2017  investment spending will total approximately 500 million  to 700 million  including approximately 175 million  for maintenance capital spending consolidated investment spending also includes other capital expenditures loan advances contract acquisition costs acquisitions and equity and other investments 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations in the starwood combination we acquired various hotels and joint venture interests in hotels which we have sold or may seek to sell we also expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include new construction loans and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because 1 we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated 218 million  cash proceeds in 2016  and 673 million  in 2015  see footnote 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions

debt debt increased by 4399 million  in 2016  to 8506 million  at yearend 2016  from 4107 million  at yearend 2015  and primarily reflected 1875 million  from the starwood combination much of which was subsequently canceled in exchange for our series s through w notes 1485 million   1500 million  face amount in series q and r notes issuances and 1373 million  increase in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by 289 million in series h notes that matured in the 2016 second quarter and 24 million of repurchased starwood senior notes in the 2016 fourth quarter see footnote 11  “ longterm debt ” for additional information on the debt issuances 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2016  our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 29 percent and an average maturity of approximately 59 years the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 07 to 10 at yearend 2016

licensed brands 

in 2011 we spun off our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special taxfree dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our then wholly owned subsidiary mvw before the spinoff we developed operated marketed and sold timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties as part of our former timeshare segment under the brand names discussed below and in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into licensing agreements with mvw for those brands 

under those licensing agreements mvw is the exclusive worldwide developer marketer seller and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the marriott vacation club and grand residences by marriott brands mvw is also the exclusive global developer marketer and seller of vacation ownership and related products under the ritzcarlton destination club brand the ritzcarlton generally provides onsite management for ritzcarlton branded properties we receive license fees under the licensing agreements with mvw for the following brands 

marriott vacation club  is mvw’s signature offering in the upscale tier of the vacation ownership industry marriott vacation club resorts typically combine spacious accommodations with one two and threebedroom options living and dining areas and inunit kitchens and laundry facilities with resort amenities 

grand residences by marriott  is an upscale tier vacation ownership and whole ownership residence brand the ownership structure and physical products for these locations are similar to those mvw offers to marriott vacation club owners although the time period for each grand residences by marriott ownership interest ranges between three and 13 weeks mvw also offers whole ownership residential products under this brand

other activities 

credit card programs    at yearend 2015  we had six credit card programs in the united states canada and the united kingdom which include both marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards credit cards we earn licensing fees based on card usage and the cards are designed to encourage loyalty to our brands

sales and marketing reservation systems and loyalty programs  we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ®  best rate guarantee gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our website or any other marriott reservation channel and ensures best rate integrity strengthening consumer confidence in our brand our strong marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards guest recognition programs and our informationrich and easytouse marriottcom website and mobile app are also integral to our success 

marriottcom and marriott mobile are two of our fastest growing booking channels now averaging over 60 million visitors each month and with updated designs personalized experiences and a new direct booking campaign  it pays to book direct  marriottcom is making it easier and more rewarding for our guests to book directly with us beyond the booking marriott mobile also now gives our guests unprecedented access to services onthego like mobile checkin and checkout one of our most widelyused digital features in 2015 we also launched mobile service requests at all fullservice hotels around the globe where guests can use the marriott mobile app to engage in a twoway chat with the hotel prior to their arrival and throughout their stay marriott rewards members now enjoy a superior stay experience thanks to these memberexclusive digital services we continue to explore and test other digital offerings that could make the hotel booking and the hotel stay experience at any one of our hotels more convenient easy and personalized 

at yearend 2015  we operated 17  hotel reservation centers eight  in the united states and canada and nine  in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and either lease the others or share space with an existing marriott property while pricing is set by our hotels our reservation system manages and controls inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and franchisees and enhance our fee revenue 

we believe our global sales and revenue management organization is a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people processes and systems our aboveproperty sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around the customer reducing duplication of sales efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts we also utilize innovative sophisticated revenue management systems many of which are proprietary which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increase efficiency in analysis and decision making and produce higher propertylevel revenue for the hotels in our system most of the hotels in our system utilize webbased programs to effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

our customer loyalty programs marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards had over 54 million members and 16 participating brands as of yearend 2015  mvw and other program partners also participate in our rewards programs the rewards programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 41 participating airline programs we believe that our rewards programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2015  rewards program members purchased over 50 percent of our room nights we continue to enhance our rewards program offerings and strategically market to this large and growing customer base our loyal rewards member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts see the “rewards programs” caption in footnote no 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” for more information 

as we further discuss in part i item 1a “risk factors” later in this report we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation revenue management and property management systems in our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and in other aspects of our business we also make certain technologies available to our guests keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position furthermore the integrity and protection of customer employee and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency 

environmental responsibility and sustainable hotels  our sustainability strategy supports business growth conservation of natural resources and protecting our planet through widereaching environmental initiatives marriott’s environmental goals are to 1 reduce energy and water consumption by 20 percent by 2020 2 empower our hotel development partners to build sustainable hotels 3 green our multibillion dollar supply chain 4 educate and inspire associates and guests to conserve and preserve and 5 address environmental challenges through innovative conservation initiatives including rainforest protection and water conservation we recently achieved our goal of reducing water consumption by 20 percent by 2020 and are continuing to make progress on our other 2020 goals

ahead we intend to build upon our progress and begin to set the stage for our next generation of sustainability goals we were the first major hotel chain to calculate our carbon footprint and launch a plan to improve energy efficiency conserve water and support globally significant projects that reduce deforestation we use energy and environmental action eeap plans our bestpractice auditing tool to help our properties achieve energy and water reduction goals working in partnership with the us green building council’s usgbc leadership in energy and environmental design leed® certification marriott is empowering our hotel development partners to build sustainable hotels we developed the first leed volume program lvp for the hospitality industry to provide a streamlined path to certification through a precertified hotel prototype the leed volume program can save our owners 25 percent in energy and water consumption for the life of their buildings and should recover their initial investment in two to six years marriott has one of the largest portfolios of leedcertified buildings in the hospitality industry over 50 with dozens more in the development pipeline 

global design division  our global design division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors global design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of our branded properties 

marriott golf  at yearend 2015  marriott golf managed 35  golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners in addition we provide similar services to three facilities operated by others 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor there are approximately 873 lodging management companies in the united states including approximately 11 that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria 

during the last recession demand for hotel rooms declined significantly particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2015 cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction in order to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is common in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2015  approximately 70 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system in the franchising business we face a number of competitors that have strong brands and customer appeal including hilton intercontinental hotels group hyatt starwood wyndham accor choice carlson rezidor best western la quinta and others 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in many overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers decline international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have more than a 10 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a two percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to customer preference across all of our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion

employee relations 

at yearend 2015  we had approximately 127500 employees approximately 11000 of whom were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation and development of properties complies in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statement the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forwardlooking statements contained in this report or in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties and home and apartment sharing services for customers  we operate in markets that contain many competitors each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains as well as home and apartment sharing services in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty programs and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline further new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets 

economic uncertainty could continue to impact our financial results and growth  weak economic conditions in europe and other parts of the world the strength or continuation of recovery in countries that have experienced improved economic conditions changes in oil prices and currency values potential disruptions in the us economy as a result of governmental action or inaction on the federal deficit budget and related issues political instability in some areas and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions will continue could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging industry us government travel is also a significant part of our business and this aspect of our business may continue to suffer due to us federal spending cuts and any further limitations that may result from congressional action or inaction as a result of such current economic conditions and uncertainty we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets recent improvements in demand trends in other markets may not continue and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery stalls or conditions worsen 

risks relating to the starwood combination 

we will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions including the risk of litigation while the starwood combination is pending that could cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees hotel owners hotel franchisees suppliers or customers uncertainty about the effect of the starwood combination on employees hotel owners hotel franchisees suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on our business although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects these uncertainties could impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the starwood combination is completed and for a period of time after that and could cause customers suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change our existing business relationships 

the pursuit of the starwood combination and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources the diversion of management’s attention away from daytoday business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results 

 12 

in addition the merger agreement restricts each company without the other’s consent from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the starwood combination closes or the merger agreement terminates these restrictions could prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business before completion of the starwood combination or termination of the merger agreement 

a number of lawsuits challenging the starwood combination were filed on behalf of purported shareholders of starwood naming various combinations of starwood’s directors starwood marriott and others as defendants although marriott was dismissed from these lawsuits an adverse ruling in any pending or future actions may prevent or delay the starwood combination from being completed starwood’s board of directors has also received demand letters from purported shareholders alleging that starwood’s board of directors breached its fiduciary duties in connection with its approval of the starwood combination and demanding that starwood’s board of directors conduct an investigation and take other actions similar lawsuits could be filed and similar demand letters could in the future be received by starwood marriott and their respective boards of directors one of the conditions to the closing of the starwood combination is the absence of any judgment order law or other legal restraint by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that prevents the consummation of the starwood combination accordingly if any of the plaintiffs is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the starwood combination then such injunction could prevent the starwood combination from becoming effective or delay its becoming effective within the expected time frame 

failure to complete the starwood combination could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results if we do not complete the starwood combination our ongoing business could be adversely affected and we may be subject to several risks including the following 

 if the starwood combination is not completed we cannot assure you that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our business financial results and stock price 

our ability to complete the starwood combination is subject to certain closing conditions and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the starwood combination to be abandoned the merger agreement contains certain closing conditions including among others 

 we cannot assure you that the various closing conditions will be satisfied or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company after the starwood combination closes or will not result in the abandonment or delay of the starwood combination for instance the consummation of the disposition of starwood’s vistana business may be delayed or not occur which could cause the starwood combination to be delayed or abandoned 

in addition before the starwood combination may be completed various approvals and declarations of nonobjection must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental authorities including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscott rodino antitrust improvements act and receipt of consents and approvals from the 

 13 

european commission and various other governmental entities these regulatory and governmental entities could impose conditions on the granting of such approvals such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying closing of the starwood combination or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the closing the regulatory approvals may not be received at all may not be received in a timely fashion or may contain conditions in addition starwood’s and marriott’s respective obligations to complete the starwood combination are conditioned on the receipt of certain regulatory approvals or waiver by the other party of such condition 

any delay in completing the starwood combination could reduce or eliminate the benefits that we expect to achieve as discussed above the starwood combination is subject to a number of conditions beyond starwood’s and our control that could prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the combination we cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied any delay in completing the starwood combination could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the synergies that we expect to achieve if the starwood combination is successfully completed within the expected time frame 

the combined company may not be able to integrate successfully and many of the anticipated benefits of combining starwood and marriott may not be realized we entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the starwood combination will result in various benefits including among other things operating efficiencies achieving those anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether we can integrate the business of starwood in an efficient and effective manner 

the integration process could also take longer than we anticipate and could result in the loss of valuable employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of which could adversely affect the combined company’s ability to achieve the benefits we anticipate the combined company’s resulting portfolio of approximately 30 brands could be challenging for us to maintain and grow and the harmonization of our different reservations and other systems and business practices could be more difficult disruptive and time consuming than we anticipate the combined company’s results of operations could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either company’s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur before the starwood combination closes the combined company may also have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and we cannot assure you that the benefits we anticipate will be realized at all or as quickly as we expect if we don’t achieve those benefits our costs could increase our expected net income could decrease and the combined company’s future business financial condition operating results and prospects could suffer 

we will incur substantial transaction costs in connection with the starwood combination we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring expenses both before and after completing the starwood combination including in obtaining necessary consents and approvals and combining the operations of the two companies these fees and costs will be substantial we may also incur unanticipated costs in the integration of the businesses of starwood and marriott although we expect that the elimination of certain duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the incremental transactionrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all further if the starwood combination is not completed we would have to recognize certain of these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the combination 

our shareholders will be diluted by the starwood combination the starwood combination will dilute the ownership position of our current shareholders we currently estimate that upon completion of the combination our shareholders before the merger will own approximately 61 and former starwood shareholders will own approximately 39 of the combined company’s outstanding common stock because of this our current shareholders may have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on us 

our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of the starwood combination following the completion of the starwood combination the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of our business our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits from the combination that we currently anticipate 

the combined company may not be able to retain marriott andor starwood personnel successfully after the starwood combination is completed the success of the starwood combination will depend in part on the combined company’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees that marriott and starwood currently employ it is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with marriott or starwood as applicable while the starwood combination is pending or 

 14 

with the combined company after the combination is consummated if key employees terminate their employment or if the combined company cannot maintain a sufficient number of employees to maintain effective operations the combined company’s business activities could be adversely affected and management’s attention could be diverted from successfully integrating starwood to hiring suitable replacements all of which may cause the combined company’s business to suffer in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms 

risks relating to our business 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which we fail or elect not to cure in addition some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have interpreted hotel management agreements as “personal services contracts” this means among other things that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future in addition some management and franchise agreements may be terminated or property owners may attempt to terminate such agreements in connection with the starwood combination if terminations occur for these or other reasons we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

our lodging operations are subject to global regional and national conditions  because we conduct our business on a global platform changes in global and regional economies impact our activities in recent years decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism have hurt our business our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic environment in each of our operating regions the resulting unknown pace of business travel and any future incidents in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the united states particularly following the starwood combination makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation  we currently operate or franchise hotels and resorts in 87  countries and our operations outside the united states represented approximately 19  percent of our revenues in 2015  in addition starwood reported that as of september 30 2015 it operated or franchised hotels and resorts in approximately 100 countries and its operations outside the united states including operations associated with starwood’s vistana vacation ownership business which it is to spin off prior to our combination represented a majority of starwood’s revenues in both 2014 and the nine months ending september 30 2015 we expect that our international revenues will continue to grow particularly following the starwood combination as a result we are increasingly exposed to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the united states many of which are outside of our control and which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions otherwise disrupt our business or damage our reputation these challenges include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and government policies that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as competition laws currency regulations and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax effective manner 4 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 5 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws 6 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest in the middle east and elsewhere acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 7 currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact the results and cash flows of our international operations 

any failure by our international operations to comply with anticorruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs reduce our profits limit our growth harm our reputation or subject us to broader liability we are subject to restrictions imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and anticorruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations such as the uk bribery act anticorruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons in order to receive or retain business the compliance programs internal controls and policies we maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws may not prevent our associates contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these 

 15 

laws and regulations we are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and the us department of commerce our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules the united states may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected any violations of anticorruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation in addition an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the united states accordingly fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues we are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our business outside of the us are generally reported in local currency which we then translate to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results we expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our nonus operations increases our efforts to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in which we receive management and franchise fees may not be successful in this regard these hedging agreements do not cover all currencies in which we do business do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

some of our management agreements and related contracts require us to make payments to owners if the hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit  some of our contracts with hotel owners require that we fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit we may not be able to recover any fundings of such performance guarantees which could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful  we cannot assure you that recently launched newly acquired or recently announced brands such as edition ac hotels by marriott in the americas protea hotels moxy hotels and delta hotels and resorts and those expected to be acquired as a result of the starwood combination or any other new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other customers we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products or that the brands or any new programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other natural disasters such as hurricane sandy in the northeastern united states the earthquake and tsunami in japan and manmade disasters in recent years as well as the potential spread of contagious diseases such as mers middle east respiratory syndrome zika virus and ebola in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers could cause a decline in business or leisure travel and reduce demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest or civil strife such as recent events in ukraine and russia the middle east and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or may delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product or service initiatives and the timing and amount of capital investments such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but we are not always able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment settlement or court 

 16 

order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations  events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands if the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be affected 

actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties in connection with lodging timeshare residential services and our credit card programs under the terms of their agreements with us our franchisees and licensees interact directly with customers and other third parties under our brand and trade names if these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems including any data breach involving customer information or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances pursuing any such recourse remedy or termination could be expensive and time consuming  in addition we cannot assure you that a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights in every instance 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance  we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed leased and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary and require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we or our franchisees can obtain or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of any capital that we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations for the property 

development and financing risks 

while  w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary  in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control the difficulty of obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we develop new hotel and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as 

 17 

demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in 2015 and 2014 in connection with our development and construction of three edition hotels and residences our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks  partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate directly or through noncontrolling interests andor licensing agreements in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under our the ritzcarlton edition jw marriott autograph collection and marriott brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 1 weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

some hotel openings in our existing development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels which could adversely affect our growth prospects we report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline including hotels under construction and under signed contracts as well as hotels approved for development but not yet under signed contracts the eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and in particular the hotels approved for development that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals accordingly we cannot assure you that our development pipeline and in particular hotels not yet under contract will result in new hotels that enter our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

if we incur losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties our profits could decline at times we make loans for hotel development or renovation expenditures in connection with entering into or amending management or franchise agreements from time to time we also provide thirdparty lenders financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings we could suffer losses if hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded 

if owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed the owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced if those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all the lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property such sales or repossessions could in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows which could negatively affect our results of operations 

planned transactions we announce may be delayed not occur at all or involve unanticipated costs  from time to time we announce transactions that we expect will close at a future date such as our anticipated acquisition of starwood hotels  

 18 

resorts if the conditions to consummating these transactions are neither satisfied nor waived by the time we expect the closings could be delayed or not occur at all 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  pricelinecom ®  bookingcom™ travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s look no further ®  best rate guarantee has helped prevent customer preference shift to the intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  yahoo ®  and baidu ®  to steer customers toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from marriottcom or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels in addition if we fail to reach satisfactory agreements with intermediaries as our contracts with them come up for periodic renewal our hotels might no longer appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of internal and customer data   our businesses process use and transmit large volumes of internal employee and customer data including credit card numbers and other personal information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties including our owners franchisees and licensees as well as our service providers in areas such as human resources outsourcing website hosting and various forms of electronic communications the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to our business if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions 

our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we as well as our owners franchisees licensees and service providers will adequately protect their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding in both the united states and other jurisdictions where we operate our systems and the systems maintained or used by our owners franchisees licensees and service providers may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and employee and customer expectations or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business efforts to hack or breach security measures failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses operator error or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our including our owners’ franchisees’ licensees’ or service providers’ information systems and records our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to such systems have increased significantly in recent years a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines or litigation breaches in the security of our information systems or those of our owners franchisees licensees or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits in addition although we carry cyberprivacy liability insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyberattacks security breaches and other related breaches 

changes in privacy law could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we are subject to numerous laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information including foreign data protection laws various us federal and state laws and credit card industry security standards and other 

 19 

applicable information privacy and security standards compliance with changes in applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs 

additionally we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

any disruption in the functioning of our reservation system such as in connection with the starwood combination could adversely affect our performance and results we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels that individuals make directly with us online through our mobile app or through our telephone call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed accuracy and efficiency of our reservation system are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands our business may suffer if we fail to maintain upgrade or prevent disruption to our reservation system in addition the risk of disruption in the functioning of our global reservation system could increase in connection with the system integration that we anticipate undertaking following consummation of the starwood combination disruptions in or changes to our reservation system could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data 

other risks 

changes in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs  we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world including those for financial reporting taxes healthcare and the environment changes to these laws regulations or policies including those associated with health care tax or financial reforms could reduce our profits we also anticipate that many of the jurisdictions where we do business will continue to review taxes and other revenue raising measures and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices or reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could significantly impact us including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our nonus operations or that could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured for example most us company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the united states is generally taxed at local rates which are often much lower than us tax rates if changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations significantly increase the tax rates on nonus income our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced if such increases resulted from our status as a us company those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our nonus competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses any shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase our labor costs which could reduce our profits 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  under the delaware business combination statute a shareholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the shareholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without shareholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a shareholder rights plan

we classify notes receivable due within one year as current assets in the caption “accounts and notes receivable net” in our balance sheets we did not have any past due notes receivable amounts at the end of either 2015  or 2014  in 2015 we issued a 58 million  mezzanine loan net of a 6 million  discount to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for a north american limitedservice property in 2014 we provided an 85 million  mezzanine loan net of a 15 million  discount to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property the unamortized discounts for our notes receivable were 31 million  at yearend 2015  and 25 million  at yearend 2014

senior mezzanine and other loans 

generally all of the loans we make have similar characteristics in that they are loans to owners and operators of hotels and hospitality properties we reflect interest income for “senior mezzanine and other loans” in the “interest income” caption in our income statements at yearend 2015  our recorded investment in impaired “senior mezzanine and other loans” was 72 million  we had a 55 million  notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses leaving 17 million  of our investment in impaired loans for which we had no related allowance for credit losses at yearend 2014  our recorded investment in impaired “senior mezzanine and other loans” was 63 million  and we had a 50 million  notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses leaving 13 million  of our investment in impaired loans for which we had no related allowance for credit losses our average investment in impaired “senior mezzanine and other loans” totaled 67 million  during 2015  81 million  during 2014  and 96 million  during 2013

14  fair value of financial instruments   

we believe that the fair values of our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts we present the carrying values and the fair values of noncurrent financial assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments determined under current guidance for disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments in the following table 



we estimate the fair value of our senior mezzanine and other loans including the current portion by discounting cash flows using riskadjusted rates both of which are level 3 inputs 

we carry our marketable securities at fair value our marketable securities include debt securities of the us government its sponsored agencies and other us corporations invested for our selfinsurance programs as well as shares of publicly traded companies which we value using directly observable level 1 inputs the carrying value of these marketable securities at yearend 2015  was 37 million  

in the 2015 second quarter the sale of an entity that owns three hotels that we manage triggered the mandatory redemption feature of our preferred equity ownership interest in that entity we received  121 million in cash and realized a gain of  41 million for the redemption which we recorded in the “gains and other income net” caption of our income statements at the date of redemption it had an amortized cost of  80 million  including accrued interest we continue to manage the hotels under longterm agreements at yearend 2014 we accounted for this investment as a debt security and classified it as a current asset in our balance sheet based on qualitative and quantitative analyses at yearend 2014 we concluded that the entity in which we invested was a variable interest entity because it was capitalized primarily with debt we did not consolidate the entity because we did not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance 

we estimate the fair value of our other longterm debt including the current portion and excluding leases using expected future payments discounted at riskadjusted rates which are level 3 inputs we determine the fair value of our senior notes using quoted market prices which are directly observable level 1 inputs as noted in footnote no 10  “ longterm debt ” even though our commercial paper borrowings generally have shortterm maturities of 30 days  or less we classify outstanding commercial paper borrowings as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis as we are a frequent issuer of commercial paper we use pricing from recent transactions as level 2 inputs in estimating fair value at yearend 2015  and yearend 2014  we determined that the carrying value of our commercial paper approximated its fair value due to the short maturity our other longterm liabilities largely consist of guarantees as we note in the “guarantees” caption of footnote no 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” we measure our liability for guarantees at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that is when we issue or modify a guarantee using level 3 internally developed inputs at yearend 2015  and yearend 2014  we determined that the carrying values of our guarantee liabilities approximated their fair values based on level 3 inputs 

see the “fair value measurements” caption of footnote no 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” for more information on the input levels we use in determining fair value

16  business segments   

we are a diversified global lodging company during the 2014 first quarter we modified the information that our president and chief executive officer who is our “chief operating decision maker” “codm” reviews to be consistent with our continent structure this structure aligns our business around geographic regions and is designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to accelerate our worldwide growth as a result of modifying our reporting information we revised our operating segments to eliminate our former luxury segment which we allocated between our existing north american fullservice operating segment and the following four  new operating segments asia pacific caribbean and latin america europe and middle east and africa 

although our north american fullservice and north american limitedservice segments meet the applicable accounting criteria to be reportable business segments our four  international operating segments do not meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable business segments accordingly we combine our four  operating segments into an “all other” category which we refer to as “international” and have revised our business segment information for earlier periods to conform to our new business segment presentation 

our three  reportable business segments include the following principal brands 

 we evaluate the performance of our operating segments using “segment profits” which is based largely on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses income taxes or indirect general administrative and other expenses we allocate gains and losses equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures and direct general administrative and other expenses to each of our segments “other unallocated corporate” represents a portion of our revenues general administrative and other expenses equity in earnings or losses and other gains or losses that we do not allocate to our segments it also includes license fees we receive from our credit card programs and license fees from mvw

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 87  countries and territories under 19 brand names we also develop operate and market residential properties and provide services to homecondominium owner associations under our business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them we group our operations into three  business segments north american fullservice  north american limitedservice  and international  

we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us base fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit house profit less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance real estate taxes and capital spending reserves 

our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while adding new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility 

we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control costs both at companyoperated properties and at the corporate level “aboveproperty” our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams dedicated associates superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction significant distribution our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards loyalty programs a multichannel reservations system and desirable property amenities we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution 

we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we address through various means hotels in our system that do not meet standards we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse website marriottcom and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to marriottcom through functionality and service improvements and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of propertylevel reservations via this costefficient channel 

our profitability as well as that of owners and franchisees has benefited from our approach to propertylevel and aboveproperty productivity properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls we also control aboveproperty costs some of which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas

pending combination with starwood hotels  resorts worldwide inc 

on november 15 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” to combine with starwood hotels  resorts worldwide inc “starwood” the merger agreement provides for the company to combine with starwood in a series of transactions after which starwood will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company the “starwood combination” if these transactions are completed shareholders of starwood will receive 0920 shares of our class a common stock par value 001 per share and 200 in cash without interest for each share of starwood common stock par value 001 per share that they own immediately before these transactions we expect that the combination will close in mid2016 after customary conditions are satisfied including shareholder approvals required antitrust approvals and the completion of starwood’s previously announced spinoff of its vacation ownership business or another spinoff splitoff analogous disposition or sale of its vacation ownership business 

performance measures 

we believe revenue per available room “revpar” which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which are components of calculating revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels 

references to yearend 2015  revpar statistics throughout this report including occupancy and adr reflect the twelve months ended december 31 2015  as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2014  for the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the us dollar the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year since january 1 2014 for the current period and have not in either the current or previous year i undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions ii been converted between companyoperated and franchised or iii sustained substantial property damage or business interruption comparable properties represented the following percentages of our properties for each year indicated 1 86 of north american properties 87 excluding delta hotels and resorts in 2015  87 in 2014  and 89 in 2013  2 57 of international properties 68 excluding protea hotels in 2015  57 71 excluding protea hotels in 2014  and 75 in 2013  and 3 82 of total properties 85 excluding protea hotels and delta hotels and resorts in 2015  82 of total properties 85 excluding protea hotels in 2014  and 87 in 2013  

we also believe companyoperated house profit margin which is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit to total propertylevel revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

business trends 

our 2015  results reflected a favorable economic climate and demand for our brands in many markets around the world reflecting generally low supply growth in the us and europe moderate gdp growth in north america improved pricing in most north american markets and a yearoveryear increase in the number of properties in our system comparable worldwide systemwide revpar for 2015  increased 52 percent  to 11225  average daily rates increased 41 percent  on a constant dollar basis to 15230  and occupancy increased 08  percentage points to 737  percent compared to 2014  

generally strong us group business and transient demand contributed to increased room rate growth in 2015  allowing us to eliminate discounts shift business into higher rated price categories and raise room rates the growth was partially constrained by new selectservice lodging supply and moderating gdp growth late in the year 

in 2015  bookings for future group business in the us improved new group business booked in 2015 for any period in the future increased 9 percent year over year the 2016  group revenue pace for systemwide fullservice hotels marriott jw marriott renaissance the ritzcarlton and gaylord brands in north america was up more than 6 percent as of yearend 2015  compared to the 2015  group booking pace measured as of yearend 2014  in north america revpar from transient 

 25 

guests increased 5 percent in 2015  reflecting strong demand from professional services technology and defense firms moderated somewhat by weaker demand from manufacturing pharmaceutical and energy companies 

the europe region experienced higher demand in 2015  across most countries primarily due to increased group and transient business driven by special events and the weak currency partially constrained by weaker demand in france particularly late in the year results improved in russia due to increased domestic travel in the asia pacific region demand increased led by growth from corporate and other transient business in japan india thailand and indonesia the growth was partially offset by weaker results in south korea revpar in greater china moderated in 2015 due to the impact of supply growth in certain southern china markets continued austerity in beijing and lower inbound travel to hong kong while demand in shanghai remained strong middle east demand was weaker in 2015 reflecting the region’s instability and lower oil prices partially offset by strong government and group demand in saudi arabia demand in the united arab emirates was constrained mainly by new supply and to a lesser extent a reduction in travelers from russia in africa results were favorable in 2015 in the caribbean and latin america strong performance in the region in 2015 was driven by greater demand in mexico and increased leisure travel to our caribbean and mexican resorts for most of the year constrained somewhat by oversupply of hotels in panama and weaker economies in brazil and puerto rico 

we monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels generally adjusting room rates as demand changes our hotels modify the mix of business to improve revenue as demand changes demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2015 which allowed our hotels to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets this mix improvement benefited adr for our companyoperated properties we continue to focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins and making productivity improvements 

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2015  2014  and 2013  

revenues 

2015 compared to 2014   

  

the 26 million  increase in base management fees reflected stronger revpar 29 million and the impact of unit growth across our system 25 million   partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 11 million lower fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised 7 million and decreased recognition of previously deferred fees 8 million 

the 108 million  increase in total franchise fees reflected the impact of unit growth across our system 55 million stronger revpar due to increased demand 31 million increased relicensing and application fees 22 million and higher fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed 7 million partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 7 million 

the 17 million  increase in incentive management fees reflected higher revpar and house profit margins primarily at companymanaged north american properties particularly at a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees higher incentive fees also reflected the addition of hotels included in the delta hotels and resorts acquisition partially offset by 15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and 7 million of lower incentive fees from properties under renovation 

the 36 million   decrease  in owned leased and other revenue reflected 44 million of lower owned and leased revenue partially offset by 8 million in higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees and hotel service programs that we 

 26 

acquired as part of our acquisition of protea hotels in the 2014 second quarter lower owned and leased revenue reflected net weaker performance impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates a decrease of 27 million attributable to properties that converted to managed or franchised or left our system and 16 million net unfavorable impact of properties under renovation partially offset by increases of 10 million from protea hotel leases we acquired in the 2014 second quarter and 6 million from the miami beach edition hotel which opened in the 2014 fourth quarter and which we subsequently sold in the 2015 first quarter as discussed in footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” 

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs such as those associated with our rewards programs reservations and marketing programs as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income the 575 million  increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies and growth across our system since the end of 2014 our managed rooms increased by 12668  rooms and our franchised rooms increased by 31883  rooms net of rooms at hotels exiting our system 

2014 compared to 2013 

the 51 million increase in total base management fees largely reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand 34 million the impact of unit growth across our system 21 million   and increased recognition of previously deferred fees 16 million partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units 8 million decreased fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised 8 million unfavorable foreign exchange rates 6 million and three fewer days of activity 2 million 

the 79 million increase in total franchise fees reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand 35 million new unit growth across our system 35 million increased relicensing fees 10 million and fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed 7 million partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units 4 million and three fewer days of activity 3 million 

the 46 million increase in incentive management fees largely reflected higher net house profit at our north american and international managed hotels in addition to unit growth in international markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 5 million and higher north american fullservice deferred fees recognized in 2013 5 million we estimate that the three fewer days of activity in 2014 compared to 2013 reduced fee revenues by approximately 5 million 

the 72 million increase in owned leased and other revenue predominantly reflected 56 million of higher owned and leased revenue 17 million in revenue from various protea hotels programs 9 million in higher branding fees and 2 million in other program revenue partially offset by 14 million lower termination fee revenue in 2014 higher owned and leased revenue reflected 43 million from protea hotel leases associated with the acquisition 30 million in revenue from a north american fullservice managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter and stronger performance across our new and existing owned and leased international properties partially offset by 37 million attributable to five international properties that converted to managed or franchised properties combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled 127 million in 2014 and 118 million in 2013 

the 764 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies at our properties and growth across our system

operating income 

2015 compared to 2014 

operating income increased by 191 million  to 1350 million  in 2015  from 1159 million  in 2014  the 191 million  increase in operating income reflected a 108 million  increase in franchise fees a 26 million  increase in base management fees a 25 million  decrease in general administrative and other expenses a 17 million  increase in incentive management fees a 9 million  decrease in depreciation amortization and other expense and 6 million  of higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses we discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees franchise fees and incentive management fees compared to 2014  in the preceding “revenues” section 

the 6 million   2 percent  increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses was largely attributable to 4 million in higher branding fees owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses was unchanged as stronger results at several of our international properties including 4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed franchised or left our system were offset by 10 million of weaker performance due to renovations 

depreciation amortization and other expense decreased by 9 million   6 percent  to 139 million  in 2015  from 148 million  in 2014  the decrease reflected a 25 million favorable variance to the 2014 impairment charge on the edition hotels partially offset by the 2015 impairment charges of 6 million for the miami beach edition residences and 6 million for the new york madison square park edition which are both discussed in footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” and  a 4 million impairment charge on corporate equipment 

general administrative and other expenses decreased by 25 million   4 percent  to 634 million  in 2015  from 659 million  in 2014  the decrease largely reflected a 28 million net favorable impact to our legal expenses associated with litigation resolutions 24 million of development costs that we deferred in 2015 related to our growing franchise pipeline and 5 million in lower foreign exchange losses compared to the 2014 devaluation of assets denominated in venezuelan bolivars partially offset by 20 million of higher costs incurred to grow our brands globally 5 million of transaction costs related to the starwood combination and 5 million from the delta hotels and resorts acquisition 

2014 compared to 2013 

operating income increased by 171 million to 1159 million in 2014 from 988 million in 2013 the 171 million increase in operating income reflected a 79 million increase in franchise fees a 51 million increase in base management fees a 46 million increase in incentive management fees and 26 million of higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by a 21 million increase in depreciation amortization and other expense and a 10 million increase in general administrative and other expenses we discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees franchise fees and incentive management fees compared to 2013 in the preceding “revenues” section 

the 26 million 12 percent increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses was largely attributable to 23 million of higher owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses 9 million in higher branding fees 4 million from various programs at protea hotels and 2 million in other program revenue partially offset by 14 million in higher termination fees in 2013 higher owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses of 23 million primarily reflects 14 million in net favorable results at several leased properties 10 million of revenue net of direct expenses for a north american fullservice managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter and 7 million of revenue net of direct expenses for new protea hotel leases partially offset by 6 million attributable to international properties that converted to managed or franchised 

depreciation amortization and other expense increased by 21 million 17 percent to 148 million in 2014 from 127 million in 2013 the increase reflected the 25 million net impairment charge on the edition hotels discussed in footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” 5 million in accelerated amortization related to contract terminations 5 million in higher contract amortization primarily from protea hotels and 3 million in higher depreciation related to a north american fullservice property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter partially offset by 13 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013 and 5 million of 2013 depreciation for two international properties that converted to managed contracts 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 10 million 2 percent to 659 million in 2014 from 649 million in 2013 the increase largely reflected 9 million from the addition of protea hotels and related transition costs 7 million from net unfavorable foreign exchange rates primarily from the devaluation of assets denominated in venezuelan bolivars and 6 million of increased guarantee funding partially offset by 8 million litigation settlements recognized in 2013 and a 5 million performance cure payment in 2013 for an international property 

 28 

gains and other income net 

2015 compared to 2014 

gains and other income net increased by 19 million   238 percent  to 27 million  in 2015  compared to 8 million  in 2014  the increase primarily reflects the 41 million gain on the redemption of our preferred equity ownership interest discussed in footnote no 14  “ fair value of financial instruments ” the increase was partially offset by an 11 million disposal loss for an international property and a 4 million expected disposal loss for a north american limitedservice segment plot of land both discussed in footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” 

2014 compared to 2013 

gains and other income net decreased by 3 million 27 percent to 8 million in 2014 compared to 11 million in 2013 this decrease in gains and other income net reflected a gain of 8 million on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company in the 2013 second quarter partially offset by 4 million in net distribution from cost method investments not allocated to any of our segments in 2014 

interest expense 

2015 compared to 2014 

interest expense increased by 52 million   45 percent  to 167 million  in 2015  compared to 115 million  in 2014  the increase was due to net lower capitalized interest expense as a result of the completion of the miami beach edition in the 2014 fourth quarter and the new york madison square park edition in the 2015 second quarter 25 million interest on the series o notes and series p notes that we issued in the 2015 third quarter and the series n notes that we issued in the 2014 fourth quarter 17 million and an unfavorable variance to the 2014 debt premium accretion trueup 7 million 

2014 compared to 2013 

interest expense decreased by 5 million 4 percent to 115 million in 2014 compared to 120 million in 2013 this decrease was principally from 8 million in higher debt premium accretion which included a trueup 2 million in lower interest on an exited lease obligation 2 million decrease due to lower interest rates on our marriott rewards program and a 2 million increase in capitalized interest primarily related to development of edition hotels in miami beach and new york offset by completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter this was partially offset by a net 8 million increase due to the issuance of higher net senior note borrowings 

interest income   

2015 compared to 2014 

interest income decreased by 1 million   3 percent  to 29 million  in 2015  compared to 30 million  in 2014  this decrease was primarily due to lower interest income on the preferred equity ownership interest that was redeemed in the 2015 second quarter 5 million partially offset by higher interest income on the 85 million mezzanine loan net of a 15 million discount we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property in the 2014 second quarter 5 million 

2014 compared to 2013 

interest income increased by 7 million 30 percent to 30 million in 2014 compared to 23 million in 2013 the increase was primarily due to 6 million earned on the 85 million mezzanine loan net of a 15 million discount provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property in the 2014 second quarter and 2 million earned on the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest acquired in the 2013 second quarter see footnote no 13  “ notes receivable ” for more information on the mezzanine loan 

equity in earnings losses 

2015 compared to 2014 

equity in earnings of 16 million  in 2015  increased by 10 million  from equity in earnings of 6 million  in 2014  the increase reflects a 22 million yearoveryear impact from the reversal in 2015 of an 11 million litigation reserve that was recorded in 2014 and associated with an equity investment and a 5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an international investee’s liabilities the increase was partially offset by a 6 million impairment charge relating to an 

 29 

international joint venture and an unfavorable variance to a 9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our international investments following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate 

2014 compared to 2013 

equity in earnings of 6 million in 2014 improved by 11 million from equity in losses of 5 million in 2013 the increase was driven by a 9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our international joint ventures operate 9 million in higher earnings from three of our international and one of our north american fullservice joint ventures and a favorable variance from a 4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate investment not allocated to any of our segments that we determined was fully impaired because we do not expect to recover the investment this was partially offset by an 11 million litigation reserve associated with another equity investment discussed above not allocated to any of our segments 

provision for income tax   

2015 compared to 2014 

our tax provision increased by 61 million   18 percent  to 396 million  in 2015  from 335 million  in 2014  the increase was primarily due to higher pretax earnings and unfavorable comparisons to the 2014 resolution of a us federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program the 2014 release of an international valuation allowance and the 2014 resolution of an international financing activity tax issue the increase was partially offset by a favorable irs settlement relating to sharebased compensation 12 million a tax benefit from an international property disposition 7 million and a favorable comparison to the 2014 tax on unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction 5 million 

2014 compared to 2013 

our tax provision increased by 64 million 24 percent to 335 million in 2014 from 271 million in 2013 the increase was primarily due to higher pretax earnings unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction and nonrecurring favorable foreign trueups in 2013 the increase was partially offset by the favorable resolution of a us federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program 21 million the release of an international valuation allowance 7 million and the resolution of an international financing activity tax issue 5 million 

adjusted earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “adjusted ebitda” 

earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” a financial measure not required by or presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” reflects net income excluding the impact of interest expense provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization our nongaap measure of adjusted ebitda further adjusts ebitda to exclude 1 the pretax edition impairment charges of 12 million in 2015 and 25 million in 2014 which we recorded in the “depreciation amortization and other” caption of our income statements following an evaluation of our edition hotels and residences for recovery 2 the 15 million pretax loss on dispositions of real estate which we recorded in the “gains and other income net” caption of our income statements in 2015 3 the 41 million pretax gain triggered by a mandatory redemption feature of a preferred equity investment in 2015 and 4 sharebased compensation expense for all periods presented 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits periodoverperiod comparisons of our ongoing core operations before the excluded items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies and because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the lodging industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings and accordingly interest expense’s impact on earnings varies significantly among companies similarly tax positions will vary among companies as a result of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies our adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense which we report under “depreciation amortization and other” as well as depreciation included under “reimbursed costs” in our income statements because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies we also exclude sharebased compensation expense to address the considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use sharebased payment awards differently both in the type and quantity of awards granted 

adjusted ebitda has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under gaap this nongaap measure excludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make in addition 

 30 

other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate it at all which limits the usefulness of adjusted ebitda as a comparative measure 

we present our 2015  and 2014  adjusted ebitda calculations that reflect the changes we describe above and reconcile this measure with net income in the following table 



business segments 

we are a diversified global lodging company with operations in three reportable business segments north american fullservice north american limitedservice and international see footnote no 16  “ business segments ” to our financial statements for other information about each segment including revenues and a reconciliation of segment profits to net income

 32 

the following discussion reflects all three  of our reportable segments we consider total segment revenues and total segment profits as defined in footnote no 16  “ business segments ” to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and profits of our operations to our competitors 

2015 compared to 2014 

we added 300  properties  51547  rooms and 51  properties  6328  rooms exited our system in 2015  

 total segment revenues increased by 678 million  to 14218 million  in 2015  a five percent  increase from revenues of 13540 million  in 2014  and total segment profits increased by 111 million  to 1504 million  in 2015  an eight percent  increase from 1393 million  in 2014  

the yearoveryear increase in segment revenues of 678 million  was a result of a 572 million  increase in cost reimbursements revenue a 109 million  increase in franchise fees a 26 million  increase in base management fees and a 17 million  increase in incentive management fees partially offset by a 46 million  decrease in owned leased and other revenue the yearoveryear increase of 111 million  in segment profits reflected a 109 million  increase in franchise fees a 26 million  increase in base management fees and a 17 million  increase in incentive management fees partially offset by a 20 million  decrease in gains and other income net a 12 million  decrease in equity in earnings a 6 million  increase in general administrative and other expenses and a 3 million  decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses for more information on the variances see the preceding sections beginning with “revenues” 

in 2015  68 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 50 percent in 2014  managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015  represented 63 percent of properties in north america and 74 percent outside of north america compared to 36 percent in north america and 73 percent outside of north america in 2014  the percentage of north american properties that paid incentive management fees to us increased compared to 2014 due to a few large north american limitedservice portfolios of properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 but did not do so in 2014 in addition in 2015  51 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of north america versus 56 percent in 2014  

compared to 2014  worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins in 2015  increased by 80  basis points and worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit per available room “hppar” increased by 75 percent  on a constant us dollar basis reflecting higher occupancy rate increases improved productivity and solid cost controls these same factors contributed to north american companyoperated house profit margins increasing by 80  basis points compared to 2014  hppar at those same properties increased by 78 percent  international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 70  basis points and hppar at those properties increased by 69 percent  reflecting increased demand and higher revpar in most locations and improved productivity 

see “statistics” below for detailed information on systemwide revpar and companyoperated revpar by segment region and brand 

2014 compared to 2013 

we added 311 properties 46050 rooms and 52 properties 6418 rooms exited our system in 2014 these figures do not include residential units during 2014 we also added two residential properties 30 units and no residential properties or units exited our system

 33 

outside of north america compared to 21 percent in north america and 70 percent outside of north america in 2013 in addition in 2014 56 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of north america versus 58 percent in 2013 further we earned 24 million in incentive management fees in 2014 from properties that did not earn any incentive management fees in 2013 

compared to 2013 worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins in 2014 increased by 120 basis points and hppar increased by 97 percent on a constant us dollar basis reflecting higher occupancy rate increases improved productivity and solid cost controls these same factors contributed to north american companyoperated house profit margins increasing by 150 basis points compared to 2013 hppar at those same properties increased by 114 percent international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points and hppar at those properties increased by 66 percent reflecting increased demand and higher revpar in most locations and improved productivity note that 2014 had three fewer days of activity when compared to 2013

development 

in 2015  we added 300  properties with 51547  rooms across our brands including 9590 rooms from the acquisition of delta hotels and resorts and 51  properties  6328  rooms left our system no  residential properties entered or left our system highlights of the year included 

 we have over 270000  hotel rooms in our development pipeline as of yearend 2015  which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts as well as nearly 27000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts we expect the number of our open hotel rooms gross to increase approximately 8 percent in 2016 this development pipeline and expected hotel room growth information does not include rooms that will join our system through the starwood combination 

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

base management and franchise fees were higher due to stronger revpar driven by rate and unit growth partially offset by 5 million of contract modifications and terminations increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels 

 38 

lower owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 8 million of weaker performance at a north american fullservice property under renovation

the decrease in depreciation amortization and other expense primarily reflected 11 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013 partially offset by 3 million of higher depreciation for a property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter and 2 million in higher accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2014 

the decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 7 million of lower termination fees 6 million of lower branding fees and 6 million of preopening costs partially offset by 10 million in revenue net of direct expenses for a property we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter

expenses and 1 million  of lower depreciation amortization and other expense partially offset by 5 million  of lower owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses 4 million  of lower gains and other income net and 3 million  of lower equity in earnings 

base management and franchise fees were higher due to unit growth and stronger room rates including 19 million of higher franchise licensing and application fees partially offset by a 5 million reduction in previously deferred fees and 3 million of contract terminations increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees 

lower owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 7 million of lower termination fees partially offset by 3 million of higher net earnings at several leased properties 

gains and other income net were lower due to a 4 million expected disposal loss on a plot of land see footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information

 base management and franchise fees increased due to stronger revpar driven by both occupancy and rate and unit growth partially offset by the impact of 16 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates lower incentive management fees reflected 15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth 

higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses largely reflected favorable operating results at several of our properties including 4 million of lower lease payments for properties that moved to managed franchised or left our system and 7 million of increased termination fees partially offset by 4 million in lower branding fees and 2 million from a property that converted to managed 

lower depreciation amortization and other expense was driven by amortization trueups and lower depreciation from an international property sold in 2015 partially offset by 5 million of higher depreciation at several of our leased properties 

general administrative and other expenses increased primarily due to higher costs for branding and service initiatives to grow our brands globally 

lower gains and other income net primarily reflected an 11 million loss on the sale of an international property discussed in footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” 

lower equity in earnings reflected an unfavorable variance to a 9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our international investments following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate and a 6 million impairment charge relating to an international joint venture partially offset by a 5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an international investee’s liabilities 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our international properties totaled 1282 million  in 2015  compared to 1305 million  in 2014 

2014 compared to 2013 

in 2014 across our international regions we added 170 properties 26737 rooms and 16 properties 3130 rooms left our system 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2013 revpar for comparable systemwide international properties increased by 51 percent to 13337 occupancy for these properties increased by 20 percentage points to 719 percent and average daily rates increased by 21 percent to 18539 see “business and overview” for a discussion of results in the various international regions 

the 67 million increase in segment profits in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily consisted of 22 million in higher incentive management fees 21 million of higher base management and franchise fees 17 million of higher equity in earnings and 11 million of higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by 6 million higher general administrative and other expenses 

  the increase in base management and franchise fees was driven by unit growth and higher revpar partially offset by the impact of 3 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and 4 million from terminated units increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth partially offset by the impact of 4 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

the increase of equity in earnings was driven by a 9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our international joint ventures operate and 7 million in increased earnings at three of our joint ventures 

the increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses largely reflected 10 million from protea hotels programs and leases acquired in the 2014 second quarter 5 million in higher costs in 2013 related to three leases we terminated 5 million of preopening costs in 2013 4 million from new units and 4 million of favorable operating profits partially offset by an unfavorable variance of 12 million in termination fees recognized in 2013 and 6 million in earnings from properties that converted to managed or franchised 

 41 

the increase in general administrative and other expenses was primarily due to 5 million related to the protea hotels acquisition and 5 million in higher compensation partially offset by a 5 million performance cure payment for one property in 2013 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our international properties totaled 1305 million in 2014 compared to 1071 million in 2013 

sharebased compensation

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

our multicurrency revolving credit agreement the “credit facility” provides for   2000 million   of aggregate effective borrowings to support general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures share repurchases letters of credit and acquisitions the availability of the credit facility also supports our commercial paper program in addition we may use borrowings under the credit facility or commercial paper supported by the credit facility to finance all or part of the cash component of the consideration to starwood shareholders in connection with the starwood combination and certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the combination borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating  we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating the term of the credit facility  expires on july 18 2018  

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect that the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations remain adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

we issue commercial paper in the united states we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as longterm based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2015  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1158 million  and reflected borrowing capacity of 1062 million  under our credit facility and our cash balance of 96 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 2000 million  of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting 938 million  of outstanding commercial paper there being no  outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings issuances of senior notes and access to longterm committed 

 42 

credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

cash from operations 

cash from operations and noncash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 04  to 10 at yearend 2015  and 05 to 10 at yearend 2014  we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which we detail in exhibit 12 to this 2015  annual report on form 10k are as follows 



spinoff cash tax benefits 

tax matters that could affect our cash tax benefits related to the 2011 spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business were resolved in 2013 as we expected the spinoff resulted in our realization through 2015 of approximately 480 million of cash tax benefits relating to the value of the timeshare business we realized 447 million of those benefits through 2014 and expect to realize approximately 33 million of cash tax benefits in 2015 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 305 million  in 2015  411 million  in 2014  and 296 million  in 2013  these included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives capital expenditures in 2015  decreased by 106 million  compared to 2014  primarily related to the 2014 development of two edition hotels partially offset by 2015 renovations at a north american fullservice property and investments in our reservations system capital expenditures in 2014  increased by 115 million  compared to 2013  primarily related to developing two edition hotels and our 2014 acquisition of an international property partially offset by the completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter 

we expect 2016  investment spending will total approximately 450 million  to 550 million  including approximately 100 million  for maintenance capital spending investment spending also includes other capital expenditures loan advances contract acquisition costs acquisitions and equity and other investments see our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for information on investment spending for 2015  our anticipated investment spending does not include additional investments we may make in connection with the starwood combination which we expect will close in mid2016 after customary conditions are satisfied including shareholder approvals required antitrust approvals and the completion of starwood’s previously announced spinoff of its vacation ownership business or another spinoff splitoff analogous disposition or sale of its vacation ownership business see footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information about the starwood combination 

 43 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations we expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because 1 we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated 673 million  cash proceeds in 2015  and 435 million in 2014  see footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan collections net of loan advances amounted to 26 million  in 2015  compared to net advances of 69 million in 2014  at yearend 2015  we had a 3 million senior loan current and 218 million of mezzanine and other loans 215 million noncurrent and 3 million current outstanding compared with a 3 million senior loan current and 239 million of mezzanine and other loans 215 million noncurrent and 24 million current outstanding at yearend 2014  in 2015  our notes receivable balance for senior mezzanine and other loans decreased by 21 million  primarily reflecting 86 million of collections on mvw notes receivable issued to us in 2011 in conjunction with our timeshare spinoff partially offset by the issuance of the 58 million mezzanine loan net of a 6 million discount described in footnote no 13  “ notes receivable ” 

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 7 million  in 2015  6 million  in 2014  and 16 million  in 2013  for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures 

cash from financing activities 

debt debt increased by 336 million  in 2015  to 4107 million  at yearend 2015  from 3771 million  at yearend 2014  and reflected 790 million   800 million  face amount in series o and p notes issuances partially offset by 314 million from the redemption of series g notes and a 134 million  decrease in commercial paper borrowings see footnote no 10  “ longterm debt ” for additional information on the debt issuances 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2015  our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 29 percent and an average maturity of approximately 46 years the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 08 to 10 at yearend 2015  

see the “cash requirements and our credit facilities” caption in this “liquidity and capital resources” section for more information on our credit facility 

share repurchases  we purchased 257 million shares of our common stock in 2015  at an average price of 7548 per share 242 million shares in 2014  at an average price of 6209 per share and 200 million shares in 2013  at an average price of 4146 per share at yearend 2015  144 million  shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our board of directors on february 11 2016  we announced that our board of directors increased by 25 million  shares the authorization to repurchase our common stock we purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates stock prices currency exchange rates and debt prices we manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency rates or how we manage such exposure in the future 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floatingrate notes receivable and floatingrate debt changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our fixedrate notes receivable and the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt

as of yearend 2014 we group operations into three  business segments north american fullservice north american limitedservice and international and provide financial information by segment for 2014  2013  and 2012  in footnote no 16  “ business segments ” and footnote no 12  “ property and equipment ”

terms of our management agreements vary but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more 

 2 

additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a percentage of annual revenues in excess of a fixed amount many of our operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners many of our operating agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies in certain circumstances some of our management agreements allow owners to convert companyoperated properties to franchised properties under our brands 

for lodging facilities that we operate we generally are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees who are needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs we provide centralized reservation services and national advertising marketing and promotional services as well as various accounting and data processing services and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs

licensed brands 

on november 21 2011 we spun off our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special taxfree dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our then wholly owned subsidiary mvw before the spinoff we developed operated marketed and sold timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties as part of our former timeshare segment under the brand names discussed below and in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into licensing agreements with mvw for those brands 

under those licensing agreements mvw is the exclusive worldwide developer marketer seller and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the marriott vacation club and grand residences by marriott brands mvw is also the exclusive global developer marketer and seller of vacation ownership and related products under the ritzcarlton destination club brand ritzcarlton generally provides onsite management for ritzcarlton branded properties we receive license fees under the licensing agreements with mvw for the following brands 

marriott vacation club  is mvw’s signature offering in the upscale tier of the vacation ownership industry marriott vacation club resorts typically combine spacious accommodations with one two and threebedroom options living and dining areas and inunit kitchens and laundry facilities with resort amenities 

grand residences by marriott  is an upscale tier vacation ownership and whole ownership residence brand mvws vacation ownership products under this brand include multiweek ownership interests the ownership structure and physical products for these locations are similar to those mvw offers to marriott vacation club owners although the time period for each grand residences by marriott ownership interest ranges between three and 13 weeks mvw also offers whole ownership residential products under this brand

other activities 

credit card programs    at yearend 2014  we had six credit card programs in the united states canada and the united kingdom which include both marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards credit cards we earn licensing fees based on card usage and the cards are designed to encourage loyalty to our brands 

sales and marketing loyalty programs and reservation systems  we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ®  best rate guarantee gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our website or any other marriott reservation channel marriott’s look no further guarantee ensures best rate integrity strengthening consumer confidence in our brand our strong marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards guest recognition programs and our informationrich and easytouse marriottcom website and mobile app are also integral to our success 

with over 50 million visitors each month marriottcom remains one of the largest online retail sites in the world and continues to experience unprecedented growth in 2014  we successfully expanded the deployment of mobile checkin and checkout to our portfolio of over 4000 hotels globally design and usability improvements to marriottcom made it easier for our guests to discover our properties on every device available we continue to explore and implement more personalized elements to enhance the experience for our online guests 

at yearend 2014  we operated 15  systemwide hotel reservation centers six  in the united states and canada and nine  in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and either lease the others or share space with an existing marriott property while pricing is set by our hotels our reservation system manages and controls inventory and allows us to utilize third party agents where cost effective with 4175  properties in our system economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and franchisees and enhance our fee revenue 

we believe our global sales and revenue management organization is a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people processes and systems our aboveproperty sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around the customer reducing duplication of sales efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts we also utilize innovative sophisticated revenue management systems many of which are proprietary which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increase efficiency in analysis and decision making and produce increased propertylevel revenue for the hotels in our system most of the hotels in our system utilize webbased programs to effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

our customer loyalty programs marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards have over 49 million members and 15 participating brands mvw and other program partners also participate in our rewards programs the rewards programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 39 participating airline programs we believe that our rewards programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2014  rewards program members purchased over 50 percent of our room nights we continue to enhance our rewards program offerings and strategically market to this large and growing customer base our loyal rewards member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts see the “rewards programs” caption in footnote no 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” for more information 

as we further discuss in part i item 1a “risk factors” later in this report we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation revenue management and property management systems in our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and in other aspects of our business we also make certain technologies available to our guests keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position furthermore the integrity and protection of customer employee and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency 

environmental responsibility and “green” hotels  our sustainability strategy supports business growth and reaches beyond our hotels to preserve and protect our planets natural resources marriotts environmental goals are to 1 further reduce energy and water consumption by 20 percent by 2020 2 empower our hotel development partners to build green hotels 3 green our multibillion dollar supply chain 4 educate and inspire associates and guests to conserve and preserve and 5 address environmental challenges through innovative conservation initiatives including rainforest protection and water conservation 

we recognize our responsibility to reduce consumption of water waste and energy in our hotels and corporate offices and are focused on integrating greater environmental sustainability throughout our business we were the first major hotel chain to calculate our carbon footprint and launch a plan to improve energy efficiency conserve water and support projects that 

 12 

reduce deforestation we use energy and environmental action eeap plans our bestpractice auditing tool to help our properties achieve energy and water reduction goals working in partnership with the us green building council usgbc for leadership in energy and environmental design leed® and the green building certification institute gbci marriott is empowering our hotel development partners to build green hotels in 2011 we developed the first leed volume program lvp to provide a streamlined path to certification for the hospitality industry through a green hotel prototype the leed volume program that marriott offers can save our owners 25 percent in energy and water consumption for the life of their buildings and should recover their initial investment in two to six years marriott has more than 110 leedcertified buildings with more in the development pipeline 

global design division  our global design formerly known as architecture and construction division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors global design provides these services on a fee basis to owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties 

marriott golf  at yearend 2014  marriott golf managed 33  golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners in addition we provide similar services to four facilities operated by others 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor there are approximately 875 lodging management companies in the united states including approximately 10 that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria 

during the last recession demand for hotel rooms declined significantly particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2014 cost reductions could again become necessary if demand trends reverse we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction in order to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition gives us a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2014  approximately 69 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is concentrated with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers decline international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have more than a 10 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a two percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to customer preference across all of our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds to be set aside generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

employee relations 

at yearend 2014  we had approximately 123500 employees approximately 11000 of whom were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

 13 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation and development of properties complies in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future

tableend 

forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statement the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forwardlooking statements contained in this report or in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties for customers  we operate in markets that contain many competitors each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty programs and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline further new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets 

economic uncertainty could continue to impact our financial results and growth  weak economic conditions in europe and other parts of the world the strength or continuation of recovery in countries that have experienced improved economic conditions changes in oil prices and currency values potential disruptions in the us economy as a result of governmental action or inaction on the federal deficit budget and related issues including for example the 2013 us federal government shutdown political instability in some areas and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions will continue could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging industry us government travel is also a significant part of our business and this aspect of our business may continue to suffer due to us federal spending cuts and any further limitations that may result from congressional action or inaction as a result of such current economic conditions and uncertainty we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets recent improvements in demand trends in other markets may not continue and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery stalls or conditions worsen 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which we fail or elect not to cure in addition some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have interpreted hotel management agreements as “personal services contracts” this means among other things that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future if such terminations occur we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

 15 

our lodging operations are subject to global regional and national conditions  because we conduct our business on a global platform changes in global and regional economies impact our activities in recent years decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism have hurt our business our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic environment in each of our operating regions the resulting unknown pace of business travel and any future incidents in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the united states makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation  we currently operate or franchise hotels and resorts in 79  countries and our operations outside the united states represented approximately 18  percent of our revenues in 2014  we expect that our international revenues will continue to grow as a result we are increasingly exposed to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the united states many of which are outside of our control and which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions otherwise disrupt our business or damage our reputation these challenges include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and government policies that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as competition laws currency regulations and other laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax effective manner 4 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 5 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws 6 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest in the middle east and elsewhere acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 7 currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact the results and cash flows of our international operations 

any failure by our international operations to comply with anticorruption laws or trade sanctions could increase our costs reduce our profits limit our growth harm our reputation or subject us to broader liability we are subject to restrictions imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and anticorruption laws and regulations of other countries applicable to our operations such as the uk bribery act anticorruption laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons in order to receive or retain business the compliance programs internal controls and policies we maintain and enforce to promote compliance with applicable antibribery and anticorruption laws may not prevent our associates contractors or agents from acting in ways prohibited by these laws and regulations we are also subject to trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control and the us department of commerce our compliance programs and internal controls also may not prevent conduct that is prohibited under these rules the united states may impose additional sanctions at any time against any country in which or with whom we do business depending on the nature of the sanctions imposed our operations in the relevant country could be restricted or otherwise adversely affected any violations of anticorruption laws and regulations or trade sanctions could result in significant civil and criminal penalties reduce our profits disrupt our business or damage our reputation in addition an imposition of further restrictions in these areas could increase our cost of operations reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the united states accordingly fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars we receive from foreign currency revenues we are also exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our business outside of the us are generally reported in local currency which we then translate to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results we expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our nonus operations increases our efforts to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce exposures to some of the principal currencies in which we receive management and franchise fees may not be successful in this regard these hedging agreements do not cover all currencies in which we do business do not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely for the currencies that they do cover and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

some of our management agreements and related contracts require us to make payments to owners if the hotels do not achieve specified levels of operating profit  some of our contracts with hotel owners require that we fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit we may not be able to recover any fundings of such performance guarantees which could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful  we cannot assure you that recently launched newly acquired or recently announced brands such as edition ac hotels by marriott in the americas protea hotels moxy 

 16 

hotels and upon completion of the acquisition delta hotels and resorts or any other new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other customers we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products or that the brands or any new programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other natural disasters such as hurricane sandy in the northeastern united states the earthquake and tsunami in japan and manmade disasters in recent years and the potential spread of contagious diseases such as ebola in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers could cause a decline in business or leisure travel and reduce demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest or civil strife such as recent events in ukraine and russia the middle east and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

disagreements with owners of hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or may delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product or service initiatives and the timing and amount of capital investments such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but we are not always able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations  events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands if the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be affected 

actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties in connection with lodging timeshare residential services and our credit card programs under the terms of their agreements with us our franchisees and licensees interact directly with customers and other third parties under our brand and trade names if these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems including any data breach involving customer information or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances pursuing any such recourse remedy or termination could be expensive and time consuming  in addition we cannot assure you that a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights in every instance 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance  we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our managed leased and owned properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary and require our franchisees to maintain similar levels of insurance market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we or our franchisees can obtain or our or their ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we and our franchisees may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of any lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of any capital that we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations for the property

development and financing risks 

while  w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary  in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control the difficulty of obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we develop new hotel and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in the 2014 first half in connection with our development and construction of three edition hotels our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks  partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate directly or through noncontrolling interests andor licensing agreements in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under our the ritzcarlton edition jw marriott autograph collection and marriott brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging business which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 1 weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

 18 

some hotel openings in our existing development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels which could adversely affect our growth prospects we report a significant number of hotels in our development pipeline including hotels under construction and under signed contracts as well as hotels approved for development but not yet under signed contracts the eventual opening of such pipeline hotels and in particular the hotels approved for development that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals accordingly we cannot assure you that our development pipeline and in particular hotels not yet under contract will result in new hotels that enter our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

if we incur losses on loans or loan guarantees that we have made to third parties our profits could decline at times we make loans for hotel development or renovation expenditures in connection with entering into or amending management or franchise agreements from time to time we also provide thirdparty lenders financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise generally subject to an obligation that the owner reimburse us for any fundings we could suffer losses if hotel owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide or fail to reimburse us for loan guarantees that we have funded 

if owners of hotels that we manage or franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be harmed the owners of many of our managed or franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans that they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced if those owners cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all the lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property such sales or repossessions could in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows which could negatively affect our results of operations 

planned transactions that we announce may be delayed not occur at all or involve unanticipated costs  from time to time we announce transactions that we expect will close at a future date such as the disposition of the new york madison square park edition hotel upon completion of construction or the acquisition of delta hotels if the conditions to consummating these transactions are neither satisfied nor waived by the time we expect the closings could be delayed or not occur at all in addition the edition contract is for a fixed purchase price based upon the estimated total development costs for the hotel and we will not recover any development costs in excess of the agreed purchase price so we will bear those development costs to the extent that they are higher than we anticipated when we agreed to the transaction 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  pricelinecom ®  bookingcom™ travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s look no further ®  best rate guarantee has helped prevent customer preference shift to the intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  yahoo ®  and baidu ®  to steer customers toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely in addition recent regulatory investigations outside of the us challenge the legality under antitrust law of contract provisions that support programs such as marriotts look no further ®  best rate guarantee and we cannot assure you that the courts will ultimately uphold such provisions our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from marriottcom or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels 

 19 

failure to maintain the integrity of and protect internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions operational inefficiencies damage to our reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits  our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services including in areas such as human resources outsourcing website hosting and various forms of electronic communications we and third parties who provide services to us also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to us if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding in both the united states and other jurisdictions where we operate our systems or our franchisees systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and employee and customer expectations or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so efforts to hack or breach security measures failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses operator error or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our and our service providers information systems and records our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to such systems have increased significantly in recent years a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines or litigation breaches in the security of our information systems or those of our franchisees or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

any disruption in the functioning of our reservation system could adversely affect our performance and results we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels that individuals make directly with us online through our mobile app or through our telephone call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed accuracy and efficiency of our reservation system are critical aspects of our business and are important considerations for hotel owners when choosing our brands our business may suffer if we fail to maintain upgrade or prevent disruption to our reservation system 

other risks 

changes in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs  we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world including those for financial reporting taxes healthcare and the environment changes to these laws regulations or policies including those associated with health care tax or financial reforms could reduce our profits we also anticipate that many of the jurisdictions where we do business will continue to review taxes and other revenue raising measures and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices or reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could significantly impact us including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our nonus operations or that could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured for example most us company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the united states is generally taxed at local rates which are often much lower than us tax rates if changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations significantly increase the tax rates on nonus income our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced if such increases resulted from our status as a us company those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our nonus competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our 

 20 

businesses any shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase our labor costs which could reduce our profits 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder rights plan

 12  property and equipment   

the following table presents the composition of our property and equipment balances at yearend 2014  and 2013  

  

we record property and equipment at cost including interest and real estate taxes we incur during development and construction interest we capitalized as a cost of property and equipment totaled 33 million  in 2014  31 million  in 2013  and 27 million  in 2012  we capitalize the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment when we incur them these capitalized costs may include structural costs equipment fixtures floor and wall coverings we expense all repair and maintenance costs when we incur them we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  three  to 40  years and we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease term our gross depreciation expense totaled 135 million  in 2014  107 million  in 2013  and 93 million  in 2012  of which 51 million  in 2014  48 million  in 2013  and 45 million  in 2012  we included in reimbursed costs fixed assets attributed to operations located outside the united states were 291 million  in 2014 and 238 million  in 2013

13  notes receivable   

the following table presents the composition of our notes receivable balances net of reserves and unamortized discounts at yearend 2014  and 2013    



we classify notes receivable due within one year as current assets in the caption “accounts and notes receivable net” in our balance sheets we did not have any past due notes receivable amounts at the end of either 2014  or 2013  in 2014 we provided an 85 million  mezzanine loan net of a 15 million  discount to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property the unamortized discounts for our notes receivable were 25 million  at yearend 2014  and 12 million  at yearend 2013

senior mezzanine and other loans 

generally all of the loans we make have similar characteristics in that they are loans to owners and operators of hotels and hospitality properties we reflect interest income for “senior mezzanine and other loans” in the “interest income” caption in our income statements at yearend 2014  our recorded investment in impaired “senior mezzanine and other loans” was 63 million  we had a 50 million  notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses leaving 13 million  of our investment in impaired loans for which we had no related allowance for credit losses at yearend 2013  our recorded investment in impaired “senior mezzanine and other loans” was 99 million  and we had a 90 million  notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses leaving 9 million  of our investment in impaired loans for which we had no related allowance for credit losses our average investment in impaired “senior mezzanine and other loans” totaled 81 million  during 2014  96 million  during 2013  and 94 million  during 2012  

the following table summarizes the activity for our “senior mezzanine and other loans” notes receivable reserve for 2012  2013  and 2014

14  fair value of financial instruments   

we believe that the fair values of our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts we show the carrying values and the fair values of noncurrent financial assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments determined under current guidance for disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments in the following table 



we estimate the fair value of our senior mezzanine and other loans including the current portion by discounting cash flows using riskadjusted rates both of which are level 3 inputs 

we carry our marketable securities at fair value our marketable securities include debt securities of the us government its sponsored agencies and other us corporations invested for our selfinsurance programs as well as shares of a publicly traded company which we value using directly observable level 1 inputs the carrying value of these marketable securities at yearend 2014  was 44 million  

in the 2013 second quarter we received 22 million   in net cash proceeds for the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company with a cost basis of 14 million  at the date of sale and recognized an 8 million  gain in the “gains and other income” caption of our income statements this gain included recognition of unrealized gains that we previously recorded in other comprehensive income see footnote no 15  “ comprehensive income and shareholders deficit equity ” for additional information on our reclassification of these unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income 

in the 2013 second quarter we acquired a 65 million  mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest in an entity that owns three  hotels that we manage we account for this investment as a debt security with a cost of 77 million  at yearend 2014  including accrued interest income and have classified it as a current asset as of yearend 2014 based on qualitative and quantitative analyses we concluded that the entity in which we invested is a variable interest entity because it is capitalized primarily with debt we did not consolidate the entity because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance inclusive of our contingent future funding commitment our maximum exposure to loss at yearend 2014  is 87 million  this security matures in 2015 we do not intend to sell this security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the amortized cost basis which may be at maturity 

we estimate the fair value of our other longterm debt including the current portion and excluding leases using expected future payments discounted at riskadjusted rates both of which are level 3 inputs we determine the fair value of our senior notes using quoted market prices which are directly observable level 1 inputs as we note in footnote no 10  “ longterm debt ” even though our commercial paper borrowings generally have shortterm maturities of 30 days  or less we classify outstanding commercial paper borrowings as noncurrent based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis as we are a frequent issuer of commercial paper we use pricing from recent transactions as level 2 inputs in estimating fair value at yearend 2014  and yearend 2013  we determined that the carrying value of our commercial paper approximated its fair value due to the short maturity our other noncurrent liabilities largely consist of guarantees as we note in the “guarantees” caption of footnote no 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” we measure our liability for guarantees at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that is when we issue or modify a guarantee using level 3 internally developed inputs at yearend 2014  and yearend 2013  we determined that the carrying values of our guarantee liabilities approximated their fair values based on level 3 inputs 

see the “fair value measurements” caption of footnote no 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” for more information on the input levels we use in determining fair value

our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes 800 million  shares of our common stock with a par value of 01  per share and 10 million  shares of preferred stock without par value at yearend 2014  we had 280 million  of these authorized shares of our common stock and no  preferred stock outstanding

16  business segments   

we are a diversified global lodging company during the 2014 first quarter we modified the information that our president and chief executive officer who is our codm reviews to be consistent with our continent structure this structure aligns our business around geographic regions and is designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to accelerate our worldwide growth as a result of modifying our reporting information we revised our operating segments to eliminate our former luxury segment which we allocated between our existing north american fullservice operating segment and the following four  new operating segments asia pacific caribbean and latin america europe and middle east and africa 

although our north american fullservice and north american limitedservice segments meet the applicable accounting criteria to be reportable business segments our four  new operating segments do not meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable business segments accordingly we combined our four  new operating segments into an “all other” category which we refer to as “international” and have revised our business segment information for earlier periods to conform to our new business segment presentation 

our three  business segments include the following principal brands 

 we evaluate the performance of our business segments using “segment profits” which is based largely on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses income taxes or indirect general administrative and other expenses we allocate gains and losses equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures and direct general administrative and other expenses to each of our segments “other unallocated corporate” represents a portion of our revenues general administrative and other expenses equity in earnings or losses and other gains or losses that we do not allocate to our segments it also includes license fees we receive from our credit card programs and license fees from mvw our codm monitors assets for the consolidated company but does not use assets by business segment when assessing performance or making business segment resource allocations

business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 79  countries and territories under numerous brand names we also develop operate and market residential properties and provide services to homecondominium owner associations under our business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them at yearend 2014  of the total population of hotel rooms in our system worldwide we operated 41  percent under management agreements our franchisees operated 56  percent under franchise agreements and we owned or leased only two  percent the remainder represented our interest in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage hotels and provide services to franchised properties we group our operations into three  business segments north american fullservice north american limitedservice and international 

we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us base fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit house profit less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance real estate taxes capital spending reserves and the like 

our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while adding new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility 

we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control costs both at companyoperated properties and at the corporate level “aboveproperty” our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams dedicated associates superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction significant distribution our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards loyalty programs a multichannel reservations system and desirable property amenities we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution 

we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we address through various means hotels in the system that do not meet standards we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse website marriottcom and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to marriottcom through functionality and service improvements and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of propertylevel reservations via this costefficient channel 

our profitability as well as that of owners and franchisees has benefited from our approach to propertylevel and aboveproperty productivity properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls we also control aboveproperty costs some of which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas 

performance measures 

we believe revenue per available room “revpar” which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which are components of calculating revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels 

references to yearend 2014 revpar statistics throughout this report including occupancy and adr reflect the twelve months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2013 for the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the us dollar the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

 24 

we define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands for at least one full calendar year as of the beginning of the current period and have not in either the current or previous periods presented i undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions ii been converted between companyoperated and franchised or iii sustained substantial property damage or business interruption comparable properties represented the following percentages of our properties for each year indicated 1 87 of north american properties in 2014  89 in 2013  and 93 in 2012  2 57 of international properties 71 excluding protea hotels in 2014  75 in 2013  and 78 in 2012  and 3 82 of total properties 85 excluding protea hotels in 2014  87 in 2013  and 91 in 2012  

we also believe companyoperated house profit margin which is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit also known as house profit to total propertylevel revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

business trends   

our 2014 results reflected a favorable economic climate and demand for our brands in many markets around the world reflecting generally low supply growth in the us and europe improved pricing in most north american markets and a yearoveryear increase in the number of properties in our system comparable worldwide systemwide revpar for 2014  increased 66  percent to 11009  average daily rates increased 37  percent on a constant dollar basis to 15023  and occupancy increased 20  percentage points to 733  percent compared to 2013  

the properties in our system serve transient and group customers which drive both business and leisure demand in 2014 threequarters of property group room revenue was contracted before 2014 and onequarter was contracted in 2014 as group demand has improved meeting planners have been booking such meetings earlier to ensure available space 

strong us group business and transient demand contributed to increased room rate growth in 2014 transient demand continued to be strong in the western us during 2014 and was stronger beginning in the third quarter in the eastern us when compared to the first half of the year as we eliminated discounts shifted business into higher rated price categories and raised room rates in new york city new lodging supply continued to constrain rate growth while in washington dc demand strengthened in the second half of the year due to increased citywide events and a favorable comparison to the 2013 government sequestration and shutdown 

in 2014 bookings for future group business in the us improved as of yearend 2014 the group revenue pace for stays in 2015 for companyoperated full service hotels marriott jw marriott renaissance the ritzcarlton and gaylord brands in north america was up about 5 percent compared to the 2013 yearend group revenue booking pace for stays in 2014 the higher pace reflected improved group demand and greater pricing power 

the europe region experienced increased demand throughout 2014 most predominately in the united kingdom and central europe primarily due to increased business travel and special events whereas results in france reflected the impact of a weaker economy eastern europe was impacted by lower demand constrained by continued economic deterioration due to the russiaukraine conflict in the asia pacific region 2014 demand continued to increase led by growth from corporate and other transient business in japan indonesia india and singapore demand increased in greater china in the first three quarters of 2014 but was also constrained by supply growth in certain southern china markets and government austerity in beijing in the fourth quarter demand moderated in greater china due to political disruption in hong kong demand in malaysia was weak in 2014 due to slower leisure travel from greater china thailand demand was weak due to political instability through most of 2014 but increased in the fourth quarter demand for our hotels in our middle east and africa regions remained strong throughout 2014 in particular demand in egypt improved due to improved political stability demand in the united arab emirates was constrained mainly by new supply and to a lesser extent a reduction in travelers from russia in the second half of the year while kuwait experienced weakness due to reduced government spending in the caribbean and latin america strong demand throughout the region in 2014 was driven by increased leisure travel to our caribbean and mexican resorts constrained somewhat by oversupply of hotels in panama 

we monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels generally adjusting room rates as demand changes we also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2014 which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets this mix improvement benefited average daily rates for our company

operated properties we continue to focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins and making productivity improvements 

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2014  2013  and 2012  

revenues 

2014 compared to 2013 

revenues increased by 1012 million   8 percent  to 13796 million  in 2014 from 12784 million  in 2013 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue  764 million  higher franchise fees  79 million  higher owned leased and other revenue  72 million  higher base management fees  51 million  and higher incentive management fees    46 million    we estimate that the three  fewer days of activity in 2014 compared to 2013 reduced fee revenues by approximately 5 million 

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income the 764 million  increase in total cost reimbursements revenue to 11055 million  in 2014 from 10291 million  in 2013 reflected the impact of higher occupancies at our properties and growth across the system 

the 51 million  increase in total base management fees to 672 million  in 2014 from 621 million  in 2013 largely reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand 34 million the impact of unit growth across the system 21 million   and increased recognition of previously deferred fees 16 million partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units 8 million decreased fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised 8 million unfavorable foreign exchange rates 6 million and three fewer days of activity 2 million the 79 million  increase in total franchise fees to 745 million  in 2014 from 666 million  in 2013 reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand 35 million new unit growth across the system 35 million increased relicensing fees 10 million and fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed 7 million partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units 4 million and three fewer days of activity 3 million the 46 million  increase in incentive management fees to 302 million  in 2014 from 256 million  in 2013 largely reflected higher net house profit at our north american and international managed hotels in addition to unit growth in international markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 5 million and higher north american fullservice deferred fees recognized in 2013 5 million

2013 compared to 2012 

revenues increased by 970 million 8 percent to 12784 million in 2013 from 11814 million in 2012 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue 886 million higher franchise fees 59 million higher base management fees 40 million and higher incentive management fees   24 million comprised of a 27 million increase for north america and a 3 million decrease outside of north america partially offset by lower owned leased and other revenue 39 million   we estimate that the 970 million increase in revenues included 8 million of combined base management fee franchise fee and incentive management fee revenues due to the additional four days of activity in 2013 compared to 2012 

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income the 886 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue to 10291 million in 2013 from 9405 million in 2012 reflected the impact of higher propertylevel demand and growth across the system 

 26 

the 40 million increase in total base management fees to 621 million in 2013 from 581 million in 2012 mainly reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand 18 million the impact of unit growth across the system 18 million primarily driven by gaylord brand properties we began managing in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the additional four days of activity approximately 3 million the 59 million increase in total franchise fees to 666 million in 2013 from 607 million in 2012 primarily reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand 22 million the impact of unit growth across the system 23 million increased relicensing fees primarily for certain north american limitedservice properties 8 million and the additional four days of activity approximately 5 million the 24 million increase in incentive management fees from 232 million in 2012 to 256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher propertylevel income at managed hotels 33 million particularly fullservice hotels in north america partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates 3 million and unfavorable variances from the following 2012 items recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain international segment properties 3 million and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an international segment propertys change in ownership 3 million 

the 39 million decrease in owned leased and other revenue to 950 million in 2013 from 989 million in 2012 primarily reflected 35 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the execustay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter and 28 million of lower owned and leased revenue partially offset by 12 million of higher branding fees 8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees and 2 million of higher other revenue lower owned and leased revenue primarily reflected fewer international segment leased properties due to three leases that we terminated in 2013 and weaker demand at one leased property in london as well as a 2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled 118 million in 2013 and 106 million in 2012

operating income increased by 171 million  to 1159 million  in 2014 from 988 million  in 2013 the 171 million  increase in operating income reflected a 79 million  increase in franchise fees a 51 million  increase in base management fees a 46 million  increase in incentive management fees and 26 million  of higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by a 21 million  increase in depreciation amortization and other expense and a 10 million  increase in general administrative and other expense we discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees franchise fees and incentive management fees compared to 2013 in the preceding “revenues” section 

the 26 million   12 percent  increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses was largely attributable to 23 million of higher owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses 9 million in higher branding fees 4 million from various programs at protea hotels and 2 million in other program revenue partially offset by 14 million in higher termination fees in 2013 higher owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses of 23 million primarily reflects 14 million in net favorable results at several leased properties 10 million of revenue net of direct expenses for a north american fullservice managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter and 7 million of revenue net of direct expenses for new protea hotel leases partially offset by 6 million attributable to international segment properties that converted to managed or franchised 

depreciation amortization and other expense increased by 21 million   17 percent  to 148 million  in 2014 from 127 million  in 2013 the increase reflected the 25 million net impairment charge on the edition hotels discussed in footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” 5 million in accelerated amortization related to contract terminations 5 million in higher contract amortization primarily from protea hotels and 3 million in higher depreciation related to a north american fullservice property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter partially offset by 13 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013 and 5 million of 2013 depreciation for two international properties that converted to managed contracts 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 10 million   2 percent  to 659 million  in 2014 from 649 million  in 2013 the increase largely reflected 9 million from the addition of protea hotels and related transition costs 7 million from net unfavorable foreign exchange rates and 6 million of increased guarantee funding partially offset by 8 million litigation settlements recognized in 2013 and a 5 million performance cure payment in 2013 for an international segment property 

 27 

2013 compared to 2012 

operating income increased by 48 million to 988 million in 2013 from 940 million in 2012 the 48 million increase in operating income reflected a 59 million increase in franchise fees a 40 million increase in base management fees a 24 million increase in incentive management fees and 17 million of higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by a 67 million increase in general administrative and other expenses and a 25 million increase in depreciation amortization and other expenses approximately 7 million of the net increase in operating income was due to the additional four days of activity in 2013 we discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees franchise fees and incentive management fees compared to 2012 in the preceding “revenues” section 

the 17 million 8 percent increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses was largely attributable to 12 million of higher branding fees 8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees and 2 million of higher other revenue partially offset by 6 million of lower owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses lower owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses was due to 7 million in costs related to three international segment leases we terminated 5 million in lower results at one leased property in london 7 million in preopening expenses for the london and miami beach edition hotels and a 2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company for our leased property in japan   partially offset by 16 million in net favorable results at several leased properties 

depreciation amortization and other expenses increased by 25 million 25 percent to 127 million in 2013 from 102 million in 2012 the 25 million increase largely reflected 18 million of impairment and accelerated amortization expense for deferred contract acquisition costs primarily for properties that left our system or which had cash flow shortfalls 5 million in higher depreciation at two leased international properties due to an asset writeoff and the impact of renovations 4 million of higher amortization expense year over year for deferred contract acquisition costs related to our 2012 acquisition of the gaylord brand and hotel management company 2 million in higher depreciation for two newly acquired properties and 2 million in higher depreciation for an international property following a conversion to franchised these increases were partially offset by a favorable variance from the accelerated amortization of 8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs in 2012 for a property that exited our system 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 67 million 12 percent to 649 million in 2013 from 582 million in 2012 the 67 million increase reflected 32 million in higher other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets higher costs for hotel development and higher costs for branding and service initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally 26 million of higher compensation and other overhead expenses including increases in hotel development staffing and bonus compensation 5 million performance cure payment for an international segment property and a 4 million increase in legal expenses primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2012 

gains and other income 

we present our gains and other income for 2014 2013 and 2012 in the following table   



2014 compared to 2013 

gains and other income decreased by 3 million   27 percent  to 8 million  in 2014 compared to 11 million  in 2013 this decrease in gains and other income reflected a gain of 8 million on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company in the 2013 second quarter partially offset by 4 million in net distribution from cost method investments not allocated to any of our segments in 2014 see footnote no 14  “ fair value of financial instruments ” for additional information on the 2013 sale 

2013 compared to 2012 

gains and other income decreased by 31 million 74 percent to 11 million in 2013 compared to 42 million in 2012 this decrease in gains and other income principally reflected an unfavorable variance from the 41 million gain we recognized in 2012 on the sale of the equity interest in a north american limitedservice joint venture and a 2 million impairment loss 

 28 

we recognized in 2013 as a result of measuring certain assets at fair value less the costs we incurred to sell those assets see footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information on the reclassification of these assets to held for sale the decrease in gains and other income was partially offset by a gain of 8 million we recognized in 2013 on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company and a favorable variance from an otherthantemporary 7 million impairment we recorded in 2012 

interest expense 

2014 compared to 2013 

interest expense decreased by 5 million   4 percent  to 115 million  in 2014 compared to 120 million  in 2013 this decrease was principally from 8 million in higher debt premium accretion which included a trueup 2 million in lower interest on an exited lease obligation 2 million decrease due to lower interest rates on our marriott rewards program and a 2 million increase in capitalized interest primarily related to development of edition hotels in miami beach and new york offset by completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter this was partially offset by a net 8 million increase due to the issuance of higher net senior note borrowings 

2013 compared to 2012 

interest expense decreased by 17 million 12 percent to 120 million in 2013 compared to 137 million in 2012 this decrease in interest expense principally reflected a net 13 million decrease due to net senior note retirements and new senior note issuances at lower interest rates and 3 million of increased capitalized interest primarily related to developing two edition hotels partially offset by completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter 

interest income 

  2014 compared to 2013 

interest income increased by 7 million   30 percent  to 30 million  in 2014 compared to 23 million  in 2013 the increase was primarily due to 6 million earned on the 85 million mezzanine loan net of a 15 million discount provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property in the 2014 second quarter and 2 million earned on the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest acquired in the 2013 second quarter see footnote no 13  “ notes receivable ” for more information on the mezzanine loan 

2013 compared to 2012 

interest income increased by 6 million 35 percent to 23 million in 2013 compared to 17 million in 2012 primarily reflecting 5 million earned on the 65 million mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest we acquired in the 2013 second quarter see footnote no 14  “ fair value of financial instruments ” for more information on the acquisition 

equity in earnings losses 

2014 compared to 2013 

equity in earnings of 6 million  in 2014 improved by 11 million  from equity in losses of 5 million  in 2013 the increase was driven by a 9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our international joint ventures operate 9 million in higher earnings from three of our international and one of our north american fullservice joint ventures and a favorable variance from a 4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate investment not allocated to any of our segments that we determined was fully impaired because we do not expect to recover the investment this was partially offset by an 11 million litigation reserve associated with another corporate investment not allocated to any of our segments 

2013 compared to 2012 

equity in losses of 5 million in 2013 improved by 8 million from equity in losses of 13 million in 2012 the change primarily reflected a favorable variance from the following 2012 items 1 8 million in losses at a north american fullservice segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties and 2 a 2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from an international segment joint venture these favorable variances were partially offset by a 4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate joint venture not allocated to one of our segments that we determined was fully impaired because we did not expect to recover the investment 

 29 

provision for income tax 

2014 compared to 2013 

our tax provision increased by 64 million   24 percent  to 335 million  in 2014 from 271 million  in 2013 the increase was primarily due to higher pretax earnings unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction and nonrecurring favorable foreign trueups in 2013 the increase was partially offset by the favorable resolution of a us federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program 21 million the release of an international valuation allowance 7 million and the resolution of an international financing activity tax issue 5 million 

2013 compared to 2012 

our tax provision decreased by 7 million 3 percent to 271 million in 2013 from 278 million in 2012 the decrease resulted from a lower effective tax rate 302 percent in 2013 compared to 327 percent in 2012 favorable tax provision to tax return adjustments in 2013 favorable variance from a reserve recorded for an international tax issue in 2012 a favorable state tax adjustment in 2013 and higher income before income taxes in jurisdictions outside of the us with lower tax rates partially offset by higher income tax expense in the us 

net income 

2014 compared to 2013 

net income increased by 127 million  to 753 million  in 2014 from 626 million  in 2013 and diluted earnings per share increased by 054  per share  27 percent  to 254  per share from 200  per share in 2013 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “revenues” or as shown in the income statement the 127 million  increase in net income was due to higher franchise fees  79 million  higher base management fees  51 million  higher incentive management fees  46 million  higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses  26 million  higher equity in earnings  11 million  higher interest income  7 million  and lower interest expense  5 million  these increases were partially offset by higher income taxes  64 million  higher depreciation amortization and other expense  21 million  higher general administrative and other expenses  10 million  and lower gains and other income  3 million  

2013 compared to 2012 

net income increased by 55 million to 626 million in 2013 from 571 million in 2012 and diluted earnings per share increased by 028 per share 16 percent to 200 per share from 172 per share in 2012 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “revenues” or as shown in the income statement the 55 million increase in net income was due to higher franchise fees 59 million higher base management fees 40 million higher incentive management fees 24 million lower interest expense 17 million lower equity in losses 8 million lower income taxes 7 million higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses 6 million and higher interest income 6 million these increases were partially offset by higher general administrative and other expenses 81 million and lower gains and other income 31 million 

earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda a financial measure not required by or presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” reflects net income excluding the impact of interest expense provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization we believe that ebitda is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business we also use ebitda as do analysts lenders investors and others to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings accordingly the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense which we report under “depreciation amortization and other” as well as depreciation included under “reimbursed costs” in our income statements because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 

 30 

we also believe that adjusted ebitda another nongaap financial measure is a meaningful indicator of operating performance   our adjusted ebitda reflects adjustments to exclude 1 pretax impairment charges of 25 million in 2014 which we recorded in the “depreciation amortization and other” caption of our income statements following an evaluation of our edition hotels and residences for recovery and determination that our cost estimates exceeded our total fixed sales price and 2 sharebased compensation expense for all periods presented we excluded sharebased compensation expense to address considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use sharebased payment awards differently both in the type and quantity of awards granted we believe that adjusted ebitda that excludes these items is a meaningful measure of our operating performance because it permits periodoverperiod comparisons of our ongoing core operations before these items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated under gaap both of these nongaap measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make in addition other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and in particular adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate them at all limiting the usefulness of ebitda and adjusted ebitda as comparative measures 

we show our 2014  and 2013  ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations that reflect the changes we describe above and reconcile those measures with net income in the following table

business segments 

during the 2014 first quarter we modified the information that our president and chief executive officer reviews to be consistent with our continent structure this structure aligns our business around geographic regions and is designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to accelerate our worldwide growth as a result of modifying our reporting information we revised our operating segments to eliminate our former luxury segment which we allocated between our existing north american fullservice operating segment and the following four new operating segments asia pacific caribbean and latin america europe and middle east and africa 

although our north american fullservice and north american limitedservice segments meet the applicable accounting criteria to be reportable business segments the four new operating segments do not meet the criteria to be reportable and we therefore combined them into an “all other” category which we refer to as “international” we have revised our business segment information for earlier periods see footnote no 16  “ business segments ” to our financial statements for further information on our segment changes and other information about each segment including revenues and a reconciliation of segment results to net income 

 32 

properties by segment 

at yearend 2014  we operated franchised and licensed the following properties by segment 



  

  33 

the following discussion reflects all three  of our segments we consider total segment revenues and total segment profits as defined in footnote no 16  “ business segments ” to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and profits of our operations to our competitors 

2014 compared to 2013

development 

we added 311  properties totaling 46050  rooms across our brands in 2014  and 52  properties  6418  rooms left the system not including residential products we also added two  residential properties  30  units and no  residential properties left the system highlights of the year included 

 

we have nearly 240000  hotel rooms in our development pipeline as of yearend 2014  which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts as well as nearly 30000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts we expect the number of our hotel rooms gross to increase approximately 7 percent in 2015 

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

2014  compared to 2013

the 34 million  increase in segment profits compared to 2013  was driven by 30 million  of higher base management and franchise fees 17 million  of higher incentive management fees and 5 million  of lower depreciation amortization and other expense partially offset by 11 million  of lower owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses and 8 million  of higher general administrative and other expenses 

higher base management and franchise fees were due to stronger revpar as a result of increased demand and unit growth partially offset by 7 million from terminated units the increase in incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels partially offset by 5 million in deferred fees recognized in 2013 

the decrease in depreciation amortization and other expense primarily reflected 11 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013 partially offset by 3 million of higher depreciation for a property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter and 2 million in higher accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2014 

the decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 7 million of lower termination fees 6 million of lower branding fees and 6 million of preopening costs partially offset by 10 million in revenue net of direct expenses for a property we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter 

the increase in general administrative and other expenses was primarily due to a 4 million increase in guarantee funding and 3 million of other property expenses

higher base management and franchise fees stemmed from both higher revpar due to increased demand and unit growth including the gaylord brand properties we began managing in 2012 a favorable variance from 2 million of fee reversals in 2012 for a property with a contract revision and also reflected fees for the additional four days of activity the increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher propertylevel income resulting from higher propertylevel revenue and margins 

 40 

higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily driven by our recognition in 2013 of 7 million in termination fees for five properties 6 million of stronger earnings at two leased and one owned property and 5 million of higher branding fees and other revenue partially offset by our recognition in 2012 of a 14 million termination fee for one property and 2 million in preopening expenses for the miami beach edition in 2013 

the increase in depreciation amortization and other expense resulted from an 11 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs primarily related to three properties that left the system and one property that converted to a franchised property 5 million of higher amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the gaylord brand and hotel management company and depreciation from the acquisition of a property partially offset by a favorable variance from the 2012 accelerated amortization of 8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for a property that exited our system and for which we earned the 14 million termination fee mentioned in the preceding paragraph 

general administrative and other expenses reflected an unfavorable variance from 9 million in other net miscellaneous cost increases and 8 million in reversals of guarantee accruals in 2012 for three properties 

the decrease in joint venture equity losses reflected a favorable variance from 8 million in losses in 2012 at a north american fullservice segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties

the increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 5 million of higher net earnings at several leased properties and 4 million of higher termination fees

the 7 million increase in segment profits compared to 2012 primarily reflected 45 million of higher base management and franchise fees and 4 million of higher incentive management fees partially offset by 43 million of lower gains and other income 

higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher revpar due to increased demand some of which was attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations and higher relicensing fees as well as the additional four days of activity partially offset by an unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of 7 million of deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture the increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher propertylevel revenue which resulted in higher propertylevel income and margins lower gains and other income primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from a 41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture in 2012 see the “gains and other income” caption earlier in this report for more information on the sale of this equity interest

  the increase in base management and franchise fees was driven by unit growth and higher revpar partially offset by the impact of 3 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and 4 million from terminated units increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth partially offset by the impact of 4 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

the increase of equity in earnings was driven by a 9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our international joint ventures operate and 7 million in increased earnings at three of our joint ventures 

the increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses largely reflected 10 million from protea hotels programs and leases acquired in the 2014 second quarter 5 million in higher costs in 2013 related to three leases we terminated 5 million of preopening costs in 2013 4 million from new units and 4 million of favorable operating profits partially offset by an unfavorable variance of 12 million in termination fees recognized in 2013 and 6 million in earnings from properties that converted to managed or franchised 

 42 

the increase in general administrative and other expenses was primarily due to 5 million related to the protea hotels acquisition and 5 million in higher compensation partially offset by a 5 million performance cure payment for one property in 2013 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our international segment properties totaled 1305 million  in 2014  compared to 1071 million in 2013

the 23 million decrease in segment profits in 2013 compared to 2012   predominantly reflected 17 million of higher general administrative and other expenses 9 million of higher depreciation amortization and other expense 5 million of lower owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses 3 million of lower incentive management fees and 3 million of increased joint venture equity losses partially offset by 15 million of higher base management and franchise fees 

the increase in base management and franchise fees largely reflected new unit growth and higher revpar due to increased demand the decrease in incentive management fees was primarily driven by a 3 million unfavorable impact from a contract revision for a property a 2 million unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with a propertys change in ownership and a 3 million unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact these were partially offset by higher propertylevel revenue which resulted in higher propertylevel income and margins and net new unit growth 

the decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses largely reflected 7 million in costs related to three international segment leases we terminated 5 million in weaker earnings at one leased property in london and 5 million of preopening expenses for the london edition partially offset by 12 million of higher termination fees principally associated with three properties 

higher depreciation amortization and other expense resulted primarily from 4 million of assets written off at two properties and 3 million due to new unit growth and renovations at two properties

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

on july 18 2013 we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement the “credit facility” to extend the facilitys expiration to july 18 2018 and increase the facility size to 2000 million  of aggregate effective borrowings the material terms of the amended and restated credit facility otherwise did not change the facility supports general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures and letters of credit the availability of the credit facility also supports our commercial paper program borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating for more information on our credit facility see exhibit 10 “third amended and restated credit agreement” to our current report on form 8k that we filed with the sec on july 19 2013 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect that the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations will remain adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill our other cash requirements 

we issue commercial paper in the united states we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2014  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1032 million  and reflected borrowing capacity of 928 million  under our credit facility and our cash balance of 104 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 2000 million  of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting  1072 million  of outstanding commercial paper there being no  outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings issuances of senior notes and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

cash from operations 

cash from operations and noncash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



 

 44 

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 06  to 10 at yearend 2014 and 07 to 10 at yearend 2013 we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which we detail in exhibit 12 to this 2014 annual report on form 10k are as follows 



spinoff cash tax benefits 

tax matters that could affect our cash tax benefits related to the 2011 spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business were resolved in 2013 and we expect that the spinoff will result in our realization through 2015 of approximately 480 million of cash tax benefits relating to the value of the timeshare business we realized 447 million of those benefits through 2014 and expect to realize approximately 33 million of cash tax benefits in 2015 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 411 million  in 2014 296 million  in 2013 and 437 million  in 2012 these included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives capital expenditures in 2014 increased by 115 million  compared to 2013 primarily related to developing two edition hotels and our 2014 acquisition of a property in our international segment partially offset by the completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter see footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information capital expenditures in 2013 decreased by 141 million  compared to 2012 primarily due to the 2012 acquisition of land and a building that we used to develop an edition hotel 

we expect 2015 investment spending will total approximately 600 million  to 800 million  including approximately 125 million  for maintenance capital spending and approximately 135 million    c168 million  for the expected acquisition of delta hotels investment spending also includes other capital expenditures including property acquisitions construction and renovations loan advances contract acquisition costs and equity and other investments 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations we expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because 1 we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated 435 million  cash proceeds in 2014 and 65 million in 2012 see footnote no 3  “ acquisitions and dispositions ” for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan advances net of loan collections amounted to 69 million  in 2014 compared to net collections of 70 million in 2013 at yearend 2014  we had a 3 million senior loan and 239 million of mezzanine and other loans 215 million noncurrent and 24 million current outstanding compared with a 3 million senior loan and 175 million of mezzanine and other loans 142 million noncurrent and 36 million current outstanding at yearend 2013 in 2014 our notes receivable balance for senior mezzanine and other loans increased by 64 million  primarily reflecting the issuance of the 85 million mezzanine loan net of a 15 million discount described in footnote no 13  “ notes receivable ” partially offset by 31 million of collections on mvw notes receivable issued to us in 2011 in conjunction with our timeshare spinoff 

 45 

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 6 million  in 2014 16 million  in 2013 and 15 million  in 2012 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures 

cash from financing activities 

debt debt increased by 582 million  in 2014  to 3781 million  at yearend 2014  from 3199 million at yearend 2013 and reflected our 2014 fourth quarter issuance of 394 million  book value of series n notes and a 238 million  increase in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by a  53 million  reduction in other debt   debt increased by 264 million in 2013 to 3199 million at yearend 2013 from 2935 million at yearend 2012 and reflected our 2013 third quarter issuance of 348 million book value of series m notes and a 333 million increase in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by the 400 million book value retirement at maturity of our series j notes 15 million in decreased borrowings under our credit facility and a 2 million reduction in other debt see footnote no 10  “ longterm debt ” for additional information on the debt issuances 

  our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2014 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 30 percent and an average maturity of approximately 46 years the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 07 to 10 at yearend 2014 

see the “cash requirements and our credit facilities” caption in this “liquidity and capital resources” section for more information on our credit facility

as we further discuss in part i item 1a “risk factors” later in this report we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation revenue management and property management systems in our marriott rewards and the ritz 

 14 

carlton rewards programs and in other aspects of our business we also make certain technologies available to our guests keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position furthermore the integrity and protection of customer employee and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency 

environmental responsibility and green hotels our sustainability strategy supports business growth and reaches beyond our hotels to preserve and protect our planets natural resources marriotts environmental goals are to 1 further reduce energy and water consumption by 20 by 2020 2 empower our hotel development partners to build green hotels 3 green our multibillion dollar supply chain 4 educate and inspire associates and guests to conserve and preserve and 5 address environmental challenges through innovative conservation initiatives including rainforest protection and water conservation 

  

we recognize our responsibility to reduce consumption of water waste and energy in our hotels and corporate offices and are focused on integrating greater environmental sustainability throughout our business we were the first major hotel chain to calculate our carbon footprint and launch a plan to improve energy efficiency conserve water and support projects that reduce deforestation we use energy and environmental action eeap plans our bestpractice auditing tool to help our properties achieve energy and water reduction goals working in partnership with the us green building council usgbc for leadership in energy and environmental design leed® and the green building certification institute gbci marriott is empowering our hotel development partners to build green hotels in 2011 we developed the first leed volume program lvp to provide a streamlined path to certification for the hospitality industry through a green hotel prototype the leed volume program that marriott offers can save our owners 25 percent in energy and water consumption for the life of their buildings and should recover their initial investment in two to six years marriott has more than 110 leedcertified buildings with more in the development pipeline 

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

marriott golf at yearend 2013  marriott golf managed 35  golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners in addition we provide similar services to six facilities operated by others 

competition we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor there are approximately 872 lodging management companies in the united states including approximately nine that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

during the last recession we experienced a significant reduction in demand for hotel rooms particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally improved from 2010 through 2013 additional cost reductions could become necessary to preserve operating margins if demand trends reverse if any such efforts become necessary we would expect to implement them in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction in order to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition gives us a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2013  approximately 69 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is concentrated with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have approximately a 10 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a two percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically 

 15 

generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

employee relations 

at yearend 2013  we had approximately 123000 employees approximately 10100 of whom were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation of properties and our development of properties comply in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations our compliance with such provisions also has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material impact in the future

forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the us securities and exchange commission the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statement the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report or in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties for customers  we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty programs and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline 

economic uncertainty could continue to impact our financial results and growth  weak economic conditions in europe and other parts of the world the strength or continuation of recovery in countries that have experienced improved economic conditions potential disruptions in the us economy as a result of governmental action or inaction on the federal deficit budget and related issues including the recent us federal government shutdown political instability in some areas and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions will continue could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging industry us government travel is also a significant part of our business and this aspect of our business will likely continue to suffer due to recent us federal spending cuts and any further limitations that may result from congressional action or inaction as a result of such current economic conditions and uncertainty we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets recent improvements in demand trends in other markets may not continue and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery stalls or conditions worsen 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which the company fails or elects not to cure in addition some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties including us or have interpreted hotel management agreements as “personal services contracts” this means among other things that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise and some courts have upheld such assertions regarding our management agreements and may do so in the future in the event of any such termination we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

 17 

our lodging operations are subject to global regional and national conditions  because we conduct our business on a global platform our activities are affected by changes in global and regional economies in recent years our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic environment in each of the regions in which we operate the resulting unknown pace of business travel and the occurrence of any future incidents in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the united states also makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business  we currently operate or franchise hotels and resorts in 72  countries and our operations outside the united states represented approximately 17  percent of our revenues in 2013  we expect that the international share of our total revenues will continue to increase in future years as a result we are increasingly exposed to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the united states which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions or otherwise disrupt our business these challenges include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of governments that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as anticorruption laws competition laws currency regulations and laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax effective manner 4 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 5 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws 6 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest in the middle east and elsewhere acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 7 currency exchange rate fluctuations 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful  we cannot assure you that recently launched newly acquired or recently announced brands such as edition autograph collection ac hotels by marriott gaylord hotels moxy hotels or any other new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other customers we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products or that the brands or any new programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other natural disasters and manmade disasters in recent years such as hurricane sandy in the northeastern united states the earthquake and tsunami in japan and the spread of contagious diseases in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers could cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest or civil strife such as recent events in syria egypt libya and bahrain and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

disagreements with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or may delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product or service initiatives such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but are not always able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations  events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands if the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be affected 

 18 

actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties in connection with lodging timeshare and residential services under the terms of their agreements with us our franchisees and licensees interact directly with customers and other third parties under our brand and trade names if these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances pursuing any such recourse remedy or termination could be expensive and time consuming  in addition we cannot assure you that a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights in every instance 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance  we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations for the property 

development and financing risks 

while  w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary  in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control the difficulty of obtaining financing on attractive terms can at times be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we develop new hotel and residential properties and previously developed timeshare interval and fractional ownership properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the 2009 and 2011 impairment charges for our former timeshare business our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion 

 19 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks  partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate directly or through noncontrolling interests andor licensing agreements in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under our the ritzcarlton edition jw marriott autograph collection and marriott brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging businesses which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 1 the continued weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may continue to reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

some hotel openings in our existing development pipeline and approved projects may be delayed or not result in new hotels which could adversely affect our growth prospects at yearend 2013 we reported approximately 1165 hotels in our development pipeline which includes hotels under construction and under signed contracts as well as over 170 hotels approved for development but not yet under signed contracts the eventual opening of the hotels in our development pipeline and in particular the hotels approved for development that are not yet under contract is subject to numerous risks including in some cases the owner’s or developer’s ability to obtain adequate financing or governmental or regulatory approvals accordingly we cannot assure you that our development pipeline and in particular hotels approved for development will result in new hotels that enter our system or that those hotels will open when we anticipate 

planned transactions that we announce may be delayed not occur at all or involve unanticipated costs  from time to time we announce transactions that we expect will close at a future date such as the recently announced acquisition of protea hotel group’s brands and management business and disposition of our edition hotels in miami beach and new york upon completion of construction if the conditions to consummating these transactions are neither satisfied nor waived by the time we expect the closings could be delayed or not occur at all in addition the edition contracts are for a fixed purchase price based upon the estimated total development costs for the hotels and we will not recover any development costs in excess of the agreed purchase price so we will bear those development costs to the extent that they are higher than we anticipated when we agreed to the transaction 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s look no further ®  best rate guarantee has helped prevent customer preference shift to the intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  yahoo ®  and baidu ®  to steer customers toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive 

 20 

traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely in addition recent class action litigation against several online travel intermediaries and lodging companies including marriott challenges the legality under antitrust law of contract provisions that support programs such as marriotts look no further ®  best rate guarantee and we cannot assure you that the courts will ultimately uphold such provisions our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from marriottcom or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels 

failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions operational inefficiencies damage to our reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits  our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services including in areas such as human resources outsourcing website hosting and various forms of electronic communications we and third parties who provide services to us also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to us if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding in both the united states and other jurisdictions where we operate our systems or our franchisees systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and employee and customer expectations or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so efforts to hack or breach security measures failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses operator error or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our and our service providers information systems and records our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to such systems have increased significantly in recent years a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines or litigation breaches in the security of our information systems or those of our franchisees or service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

other risks 

changes in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs  our businesses are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world including those for financial reporting taxes healthcare and the environment changes to these laws regulations and policies including those associated with health care tax or financial reforms could reduce our profits further we anticipate that many of the jurisdictions in which we do business will continue to review tax and other revenue raising laws regulations and policies and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our nonus operations or that could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured for example most us company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the united states is generally taxed at local rates which are often much lower than us tax rates if changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations significantly increase the tax rates on nonus income our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced if such increases resulted from our status as a us company those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our nonus competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our 

 21 

businesses any shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase our labor costs which could reduce our profits of our thirdparty owners 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder’s rights plan

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

business and overview 

overview 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 72  countries and territories under numerous brand names we also develop operate and market residential properties and provide services to homecondominium owner associations under our business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them at yearend 2013 of the total population of hotel rooms in our system worldwide we operated 42  percent under management agreements our franchisees operated 55  percent under franchise agreements and we owned or leased only two  percent the remainder represented our interest in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage hotels and provide services to franchised properties we group our operations into four business segments north american fullservice north american limitedservice international and luxury 

we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us base fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit house profit less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance real estate taxes capital spending reserves and the like 

our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while adding new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility 

we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control costs both at companyoperated properties and at the corporate level aboveproperty our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams dedicated associates superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction significant distribution our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards loyalty programs a multichannel reservations system and desirable property amenities we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution 

we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we address through various means hotels in the system that do not meet standards we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse website marriottcom and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to marriottcom through functionality and service improvements and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of propertylevel reservations via this costefficient channel in 2013 we successfully launched mobile checkin at 350 marriott hotels both in north america and select international locations 

our profitability as well as that of owners and franchisees has benefited from our approach to propertylevel and aboveproperty productivity properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls we also control aboveproperty costs some of which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas

performance measures 

we believe revenue per available room revpar which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues we also believe occupancy and average daily rate “adr” which both correlate with revpar are meaningful indicators of our performance occupancy which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity adr which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels 

references to yearend 2013 revpar statistics including occupancy and average daily rate throughout this report reflect the twelve months ended december 31 2013 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012 references to revpar statistics including occupancy and average daily rate have not been modified to a calendar basis for yearend 2012 compared to yearend 2011 accordingly these statistics reflect the 52week period ended december 28 2012 compared to the 52week period ended december 30 2011 with the exception of the ritzcarlton and autograph collection brand properties and properties located outside of the united states where statistics are for the twelve months ended for each year presented consistent with historic presentation for the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the us dollar the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant us dollar basis we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and have not in either the current or previous periods presented i undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions ii been converted between company operated and franchised or iii sustained substantial property damage or business interruption comparable properties represented the following percentage of our properties for the years ended 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 1 89 93 and 94 of north american properties 2 75 78 and 79 of international properties and 3 87 91 and 92 of total properties 

we also believe companyoperated house profit margin which is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit also known as house profit to total propertylevel revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

results   

conditions for our business continued to improve in 2013 reflecting generally low supply growth in the united states us global improving economic climate in many markets around the world improved pricing in most markets and a yearoveryear increase in the number of properties in our system demand was particularly strong at luxury properties followed by fullservice properties and limitedservice properties 

comparable worldwide systemwide average daily rates for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 increased 34  percent on a constant dollar basis to 14333  revpar increased 46  percent to 10246  and occupancy increased 09  percentage points to 715  percent compared to the same period a year ago 

continuing economic uncertainty in the us and us government sequestration had a dampening effect on shortterm group customer demand through the 2013 first half shortterm group customer demand improved in the 2013 second half benefiting from better attendance at group functions group bookings in the 2013 second half for future shortterm group business also improved government and governmentrelated demand was constrained due to government spending restrictions and the us federal government shutdown in october particularly in washington dc and the surrounding areas transient demand was particularly strong in the western us which allowed us to continue eliminating discounts shifting business into higher rated price categories and raising room rates in the northeast us weak group demand in the region in the first half of 2013 new supply in the city of new york and weak government and governmentrelated business in washington dc further impacted by the government shutdown constrained revpar improvement leisure destinations in the us had strong demand 

the properties in our system serve both transient and group customers business transient and leisure transient demand in the us was strong in 2013 for group business twothirds is typically booked before the year of arrival and onethird is booked in the year of arrival also during an economic recovery group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings during the recent us economic recession organizers of large group meetings 

 26 

scheduled smaller and fewer meetings to take place in 2013 than was previously typical as the us economy recovered we replaced this lower level of large advancepurchase groups with smaller lastminute group bookings and transient business lastminute group demand weakened during the first half of 2013 largely driven by weak corporate business and soft government demand at many properties but corporate demand improved in the 2013 second half us government group demand weakened further as the year progressed significantly impacted by the government shutdown in the 2013 fourth quarter 

shortterm group demand shortfalls in the 2013 first half were largely mitigated by strong transient demand leading to strong occupancy rates at the same time as transient guests typically spend less on food and beverage than group customers propertylevel food and beverage revenues increased yearoveryear more slowly than room revenue in addition spending on food and beverage in 2013 was constrained by the somewhat uncertain economic climate and government spending restrictions in the us 

as of yearend 2013 our group revenue booking pace for companyoperated marriott hotels brand properties in north america is up over 4 percent for stays in 2014 compared to yearend 2012 booking pace for stays in 2013 reflecting improved group demand and greater pricing power 

outside of north america eastern europe russia and northern united kingdom had strong demand in 2013 while western europe experienced moderate revpar growth london revpar declined in the first three quarters of 2013 reflecting tough comparisons to last years summer olympic games but improved in the 2013 fourth quarter demand in france weakened as the year progressed demand remained weak in european markets more dependent on regional travel and new supply and weak economies constrained revpar growth in a few markets in the middle east demand was strong in the united arab emirates but weakened further in egypt particularly in the second half of 2013 jordan and qatar demand in the asia pacific region continued to moderate as our hotels in china experienced weaker governmentrelated travel moderating economic growth and new supply in several markets   thailand and indonesia had higher demand and strong revpar growth in 2013 

we monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels generally adjusting room rates as demand changes we also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2013 which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets this mix improvement benefited average daily rates for our companyoperated properties we continue to focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins and actively pursue productivity improvements 

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2013  2012  and 2011  which included the results of the former timeshare segment before the spinoff 

in late 2011 we completed the spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business accordingly we no longer have a timeshare segment and instead earn license fees that we do not allocate to any of our segments and include in other unallocated corporate see footnote no 15 spinoff for additional information 

revenues 

2013 compared to 2012 

revenues increased by 970 million   8 percent  to 12784 million  in 2013 from 11814 million  in 2012 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue  886 million  higher franchise fees  59 million  higher base management fees  40 million  and higher incentive management fees    24 million  comprised of a 27 million increase for north america and a 3 million decrease outside of north america partially offset by lower owned leased and other revenue  39 million    we estimate that the 970 million  increase in revenues included 8 million of combined base management fee franchise fee and incentive management fee revenues due to the additional four days of activity in 2013 compared to 2012 

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income the 886 million  increase in total cost reimbursements revenue to 10291 million  in 2013 from 9405 million  in 2012 reflected the impact of higher propertylevel demand and growth across the system

2012 compared to 2011 

revenues decreased by 503 million 4 percent to 11814 million in 2012 from 12317 million in 2011 as detailed later in this report in the table under the caption former timeshare segment  2012 compared to 2011 the spinoff contributed to a net 1282 million decrease in revenues this decrease was partially offset by a 779 million increase in revenues in our lodging business 

the 779 million increase in revenues for our lodging business was a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue 757 million higher franchise fees 44 million higher incentive management fees 37 million comprised of an 18 million increase for north america and a 19 million increase outside of north america and higher base management fees 35 million partially offset by lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue 94 million which includes a 70 million reduction from our sold corporate housing business as further discussed later in this section 

the 562 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue to 9405 million in 2012 from 8843 million in 2011 reflected a 757 million increase allocated across our lodging business resulting from higher propertylevel demand and growth across our system partially offset by a net 195 million decline in timesharerelated cost reimbursements due to the spinoff 

the 21 million decrease in total base management fees to 581 million in 2012 from 602 million in 2011 primarily reflected a decline of 56 million in former timeshare segment 51 million and international segment 5 million base management fees due to the spinoff partially offset by a net increase of 35 million across our lodging business the 35 million net increase in base management fees across our lodging business primarily reflected stronger revpar 24 million and the impact of unit growth across the system 9 million as well as recognition in the 2012 third quarter of 7 million of previously deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a north americanlimited service joint venture partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates 3 million and the unfavorable impact of 3 million of fee reversals in 2012 for two properties to reflect contract revisions the 101 million increase in total franchise fees to 607 million in 2012 from 506 million in 2011 primarily reflected an increase of 57 million in license fees from mvw and an increase of 44 million across our lodging business primarily as a result of stronger revpar 27 million and the impact of unit growth across the system 13 million the 37 million increase in incentive management fees from 195 million in 2011 to 232 million in 2012 primarily reflected higher net propertylevel income 30 million new unit growth net of terminations 6 million recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain international segment properties 3 million and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an international segment propertys change in ownership 3 million partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates 4 million

 28 

termination fees partially offset by 7 million of higher branding fees and 3 million of higher other revenue the 29 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected 1 34 million of lower revenue at several owned and leased properties in our international segment primarily driven by three hotels that left the system 18 million weaker demand at three other hotels 6 million two hotels that are no longer leased but remain within our system as managed or franchised properties 5 million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates 5 million and 2 23 million of lower revenue at a north american fullservice segment property that converted from leased to managed at yearend 2011 partially offset by 3 14 million of higher revenue at one leased property in london due to strong demand in part associated with the 2012 third quarter olympic games and 4 10 million of higher revenue at one leased property in japan the property in japan benefited from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a 2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled 106 million in 2012 and 99 million in 2011

the 6 million   4 percent  increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was largely attributable to 12 million of higher branding fees 8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees and 2 million of higher other revenue partially offset by 17 million of lower owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses lower owned and leased revenue net of direct expenses was primarily due to 7 million in costs related to three international segment leases we terminated 5 million in lower results at one leased property in london 7 million in preopening expenses for the london and miami edition hotels and a 2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company for our leased property in japan partially offset by 4 million in net favorable results at several leased properties 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 81 million   13 percent  to 726 million  in 2013 from 645 million  in 2012 the 81 million  increase largely reflected the following 2013 items 1 32 million increased other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets higher costs for hotel development and higher costs for branding and service initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally 2 26 million of higher compensation and other overhead expenses including increases in hotel development staffing and bonus compensation 3 18 million of impairment and accelerated amortization expense for deferred contract acquisition costs primarily for properties that left our system or which had cash flow shortfalls 4 a 5 million performance cure payment for an international segment property 5 4 million of higher amortization expense year over year for deferred contract acquisition costs related to the 2012 gaylord brand and hotel management company acquisition and 6 a 4 million increase in legal expenses primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a favorable variance from the accelerated amortization of 8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs in 2012 for a property that exited our system the 81 million  increase in total general administrative and other expenses included 27 million that we did not allocate to any of our segments and 54 million that we allocated as follows 18 million to our international segment 19 million to our luxury segment 15 million to our north american fullservice segment and 2 million to our north american limitedservice segment 

2012 compared to 2011 

operating income increased by 414 million to 940 million in 2012 from 526 million in 2011 the 414 million increase in operating income reflected a net 265 million favorable variance due to the spinoff which included 324 million of timeshare strategyimpairment charges in 2011 see footnote no 15 spinoff for additional information on these charges as detailed in the table under the caption former timeshare segment  2012 compared to 2011 and a 149 million increase across our lodging business this 149 million increase across our lodging business reflected a 44 million increase in franchise fees a 37 million increase in incentive management fees a 35 million increase in base management fees 25 million of higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses and an 8 million decrease in general administrative and other expenses we discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees franchise fees and incentive management fees across our lodging business compared to 2011 in the preceding “revenues” section

general administrative and other expenses decreased by 107 million 14 percent to 645 million in 2012 from 752 million in 2011 the 107 million decrease reflected a decline of 99 million due to the spinoff consisting of 63 million of former timeshare segment general administrative and other expenses and 36 million of other expenses not previously allocated to the former timeshare segment including 34 million of timeshare spinoff costs and 2 million of other expenses and a decline of 8 million across our lodging business the 8 million decrease across our lodging business was primarily a result of 1 favorable variances from the following 2011 items a a 5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a 5 million accounts receivable reserve both for one luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy b a 5 million performance cure payment for a north american fullservice property and c 8 million for a guarantee accrual for one north american fullservice property and the writeoff of contract acquisition costs for several other properties and 2 11 million of guarantee accrual reversals in 2012 primarily associated with four properties for which we either satisfied the related guarantee requirements or were otherwise released 3 a favorable litigation settlement partially offset by higher legal expenses netting to a favorable 3 million and 4 2 million in decreased expenses due to favorable foreign exchange rates these favorable items were partially offset by 1 the following unfavorable 2012 items a 20 million of increased compensation and other overhead expenses and b the accelerated amortization of 8 million of deferred contract acquisitions costs for a north american fullservice segment property for which we earned a termination fee that we recorded in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue and 2 the unfavorable variance for a 5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision for one property with increased expected future cash flows see business segments north american fullservice lodging for more information on the termination fee and the related accelerated amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs recorded in 2012 

the 8 million decrease in total general administrative and other expenses across our lodging business consisted of a 21 million decrease allocated to our luxury segment partially offset by an 11 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments and a 2 million increase allocated to our north american fullservice segment 

gains losses and other income

gains and other income decreased by 31 million   74 percent  to 11 million  in 2013 compared to 42 million  in 2012 this decrease in gains and other income principally reflected an unfavorable variance from the 41 million gain we recognized in 2012 on the sale of the equity interest in a north american limitedservice joint venture which we discuss in the following  2012 compared to 2011  discussion and a 2 million impairment loss we recognized in 2013 as a result of measuring certain assets at fair value less the costs we incurred to sell those assets see footnote no 7 acquisition and dispositions for more information on the reclassification of these assets to held for sale the decrease in gains and other income was partially offset by a gain of 8 million we recognized in 2013 on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company and a favorable variance from an otherthantemporary 7 million impairment we recorded in 2012 which we discuss in the following  2012 compared to 2011  discussion 

 30 

2012 compared to 2011 

in 2012 we recognized a total gain of 41 million on the sale of an equity interest in a north american limitedservice joint venture formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale which consisted of 1 a 21 million gain on the sale of this interest reflected in the gain on sale of joint venture and other investments caption in the preceding table and 2 recognition of the 20 million remaining gain we deferred in 2005 due to contingencies in the original transaction documents for the sale of land to one of the joint ventures reflected in the gains on sales of real estate and other caption in the preceding table see footnote no 7 acquisitions and dispositions for more information on the sale of this equity interest

interest expense 

2013 compared to 2012 

interest expense decreased by 17 million   12 percent  to 120 million  in 2013 compared to 137 million  in 2012 this decrease in interest expense principally reflected a net 13 million decrease due to net senior note retirements and new senior note issuances at lower interest rates and 3 million of increased capitalized interest primarily related to developing two edition hotels partially offset by completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter 

2012 compared to 2011 

interest expense decreased by 27 million 16 percent to 137 million in 2012 compared to 164 million in 2011 this decrease reflected a 29 million decrease due to the spinoff partially offset by a 2 million increase for our lodging business the 29 million decrease in interest expense due to the spinoff consisted of interest expense in 2011 that was allocated to the former timeshare segment 43 million partially offset by interest expense in 2012 for ongoing obligations for costs that were a component of timesharedirect expenses before the spinoff 8 million and the unfavorable variance to 2011 for capitalized interest expense for construction projects for our former timeshare segment 6 million for the 8 million of interest expense in 2012 for ongoing spinoff obligations we also recorded 8 million of interest income in 2012 for the associated notes receivable the 2 million increase in interest expense for our lodging business was primarily for the series k notes and the series l notes we issued in 2012 23 million as well as increased interest expense for our marriott rewards program and our commercial paper program reflecting higher average balances and interest rates 2 million partially offset by increased capitalized interest expense principally for lodging construction projects 15 million and the absence of interest expense for the series f senior notes following our repayment of those notes in 2012 9 million see the liquidity and capital resources caption later in this report for more information on our credit facility 

interest income and income tax 

2013 compared to 2012 

interest income increased by 6 million   35 percent  to 23 million  in 2013 compared to 17 million  in 2012 primarily reflecting 5 million earned on the 65 million mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest we acquired in the 2013 second quarter see footnote no 4 fair value of financial instruments for more information on the acquisition 

our tax provision decreased by 7 million   3 percent  to 271 million  in 2013 from 278 million  in 2012 the decrease resulted from a lower effective tax rate 302 percent in 2013 compared to 327 percent in 2012 favorable tax provision to tax return adjustments in 2013 favorable variance from a reserve recorded for an international tax issue in 2012 a favorable state tax adjustment in 2013 and higher income before income taxes in jurisdictions outside of the us with lower tax rates partially offset by higher income tax expense in the us 

2012 compared to 2011 

interest income increased by 3 million 21 percent to 17 million in 2012 compared to 14 million in 2011 primarily reflecting 9 million of increased interest income for two notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spinoff partially offset by a 6 million decrease primarily from the repayment of certain loans for 8 million of the 9 million increase 

 31 

in interest income in 2012 for notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spinoff we also recorded 8 million of interest expense in 2012 for ongoing obligations for those notes 

our tax provision increased by 120 million 76 percent to 278 million in 2012 from 158 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to the absence of timeshare pretax losses in 2012 due to the spinoff and the effect of higher pretax income from our lodging business as well as a lower percentage of lodging pretax income in 2012 from jurisdictions outside the us with lower tax rates these increases in the provision were partially offset by a favorable variance from 34 million of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to write off certain deferred tax assets transferred to mvw in conjunction with the spinoff

equity in losses of 5 million  in 2013 improved by 8 million  from equity in losses of 13 million  in 2012 the change primarily reflected a favorable variance from the following 2012 items 1 8 million in losses at a luxury segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties and 2 a 2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from another luxury segment joint venture these favorable variances were partially offset by a 4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate joint venture not allocated to one of our segments that we determined was fully impaired because we did not expect to recover the investment 

2012 compared to 2011 

equity in losses of 13 million in 2012 was unchanged from equity in losses of 13 million in 2011 and reflected a 4 million decrease in equity in losses across our lodging business entirely offset by a 4 million unfavorable variance due to the impact of the spinoff the 4 million decrease in equity in losses across our lodging business primarily reflected 3 million of increased earnings at two international segment joint ventures 3 million of decreased losses at two other joint ventures and a 3 million favorable variance from the 2012 sale of an equity interest in a north american limitedservice joint venture formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale which had losses in the prior year partially offset by 3 million of increased losses at a luxury segment joint venture and a 2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from another luxury segment joint venture the 3 million of increased losses at a luxury segment joint venture reflected increased losses of 8 million primarily from the impairment of certain underlying residential properties in 2012 partially offset by 5 million of decreased losses in 2012 after the impairment as a result of decreased joint venture costs the 4 million unfavorable variance due to the impact of the spinoff reflected the 4 million reversal in 2011 of the funding liability associated with timesharestrategy impairment charges we originally recorded in 2009 see footnote no 18 timeshare strategyimpairment charges of our 2011 form 10k for additional information on this reversal 

net income 

2013 compared to 2012 

net income increased by 55 million  to 626 million  in 2013 from 571 million  in 2012 and diluted earnings per share increased by 028  per share  16 percent  to 200  per share from 172  per share in 2012 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “revenues” or as shown in the consolidated statements of income the 55 million  increase in net income was due to higher franchise fees  59 million  higher base management fees  40 million  higher incentive management fees  24 million  lower interest expense  17 million  lower equity in losses  8 million  lower income taxes  7 million  higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses  6 million  and higher interest income  6 million  these increases were partially offset by higher general administrative and other expenses  81 million  and lower gains and other income  31 million  

2012 compared to 2011 

net income increased by 373 million to 571 million in 2012 from 198 million in 2011 and diluted earnings per share increased by 117 per share 213 percent to 172 per share from 055 per share in 2011 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “revenues” or as shown in the consolidated statements of income the 373 million increase in net income was due to the impact of the spinoff 296 million as well as the following increases across our lodging business higher gains and other income 52 million higher franchise fees 44 million higher incentive management fees 37 million higher base management fees 35 million higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 25 million lower general administrative and other expenses 8 million and lower

earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda a financial measure that is not prescribed or authorized by united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization we believe that ebitda is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business we also use ebitda as do analysts lenders investors and others to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings accordingly the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies we therefore exclude depreciation and amortization expense effective with this report we have also modified our ebitda calculation to exclude depreciation and amortization expense that we classify in the owned leased and corporate housingdirect expenses and general administrative and other expenses captions of our income statements as well as the depreciation expense that third party owners reimburse to us that we classify in the reimbursed costs caption of our income statements 

we also believe that adjusted ebitda another nongaap financial measure is a meaningful indicator of operating performance our adjusted ebitda reflects 1 an adjustment to exclude the 41 million pretax gain on the 2012 sale of an equity interest in a north american limitedservice joint venture discussed earlier in the gains and other income caption and 2 beginning with this report an adjustment to exclude sharebased compensation expense for all years presented because companies use sharebased payment awards differently both in the type and quantity of awards granted we excluded sharebased compensation expense to address considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense we believe adjusted ebitda that excludes these items is a meaningful measure of our operating performance because it permits periodoverperiod comparisons of our ongoing core operations before these items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated under gaap both of these nongaap measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make in addition other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and in particular adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate them at all limiting ebitdas and adjusted ebitdas usefulness as comparative measures 

we show our 2013 and 2012 ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations that reflect the changes we describe above and reconcile those measures with net income in the following tables

business segments 

we are a diversified lodging company with operations in four business segments north american fullservice north american limitedservice international and luxury see footnote no 14 “business segments” for further information 

in addition to our four current segments on november 21 2011 we spun off our former timeshare operations and timeshare development business which had until that time been our timeshare segment as a new independent company mvw see footnote no 14 “business segments” for historical financial results of our former timeshare segment and footnote no 15 spinoff for more information

total segment financial results increased by 24 million  to 1197 million  in 2013 from 1173 million in 2012 and total segment revenues increased by 992 million  to 12518 million  in 2013 a 9 percent  increase from revenues of 11526 million in 2012 

the yearoveryear increase in segment revenues of 992 million  was a result of a 923 million  increase in cost reimbursements revenue a 59 million  increase in franchise fees a 40 million  increase in base management fees and a 24 million  increase in incentive management fees partially offset by a 54 million  decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue the yearoveryear increase of 24 million  in segment results reflected a 59 million  increase in franchise fees a 40 million  increase in base management fees a 24 million  increase in incentive management fees and 8 million  of lower joint venture equity losses partially offset by a 54 million  increase in general administrative and other expenses 44 million  of lower gains and other income and a 9 million  decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses for more information on the variances see the preceding sections beginning with “revenues” 

in 2013 39 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 33 percent in 2012 in addition in 2013 58 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the united states versus 65 percent in 2012 in north america 22 percent of managed properties paid incentive management fees to us in 2013 compared to 15 percent in 2012 further in north america 20 north american limitedservice segment properties 19 north american fullservice segment properties and two luxury segment properties earned a combined 8 million in incentive management fees in 2013 but did not earn any incentive management fees in 2012

compared to 2012 worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins in 2013 increased by 90  basis points and worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit per available room “hppar” increased by 62 percent  on a constant us dollar basis reflecting higher occupancy rate increases improved productivity and lower energy costs these same factors contributed to north american companyoperated house profit margins increasing by 130  basis points compared to 2012 hppar at those same properties increased by 83 percent  international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 40  basis points and hppar at those properties increased by 34 percent  reflecting increased demand and higher revpar in most locations and improved productivity note that 2013 had four additional days of activity 

2012 compared to 2011

the yearoveryear net increase in segment revenues across our lodging business of 772 million resulted from a 757 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue which does not impact operating income or net income a 44 million increase in franchise fees a 35 million increase in base management fees and a 37 million increase in incentive management fees partially offset by a 101 million decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue the 196 million yearoveryear increase in segment results across our lodging business reflected a 44 million increase in franchise fees 39 million of higher gains and other income a 37 million increase in incentive management fees a 35 million increase in base management fees a 19 million decrease in general administrative and other expenses an 18 million increase in owned

development 

we added 161  properties totaling 25420  rooms across our brands in 2013 and 51  properties  10299  rooms left the system not including residential products we also added five  residential properties  301  units and no residential properties left the system highlights of the year included 

 

we currently have over 195000  hotel rooms in our development pipeline which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts as well as nearly 30000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts we expect the number of our hotel rooms gross to increase approximately six percent in 2014 

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

2013 compared to 2012 

in 2013  across our north american fullservice segment we added 12  properties  2922  rooms and 14  properties  5163  rooms left the system 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2013  compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012 revpar for comparable systemwide north american fullservice properties increased by 54 percent  to 11739  occupancy for these properties increased by 09  percentage points to 715 percent  and average daily rates increased by 40 percent  to 16424  

the 44 million  increase in segment results compared to 2012 was driven by 34 million of higher base management and franchise fees and 22 million of higher incentive management fees partially offset by 15 million of higher general administrative and other expenses owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses was unchanged compared to 2012 

higher base management and franchise fees stemmed from both higher revpar due to increased demand and unit growth including the gaylord brand properties we began managing in 2012 and also reflected fees for the additional four days of activity the increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher propertylevel income resulting from higher propertylevel revenue and margins 

general administrative and other expenses reflected the following 2013 items the 8 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs primarily related to two properties that left the system and one property that converted to a franchised property 4 million of higher amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the gaylord brand and hotel management company acquisition and 9 million in other net miscellaneous cost increases these increases were partially offset by a favorable variance from the 2012 accelerated amortization of 8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for a property that exited our system and for which we earned a 14 million termination fee 

owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses was unchanged primarily driven by our recognition in 2012 of a 14 million termination fee for one property and our recognition in 2013 of 7 million in termination fees for five properties and 4 million of stronger results at two leased properties 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our north american fullservice segment properties totaled 5896 million  in 2013  compared to 5325 million in 2012

the 56 million increase in segment results compared to 2011 primarily reflected 30 million of higher base management and franchise fees 15 million of higher incentive management fees and 11 million of higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by 2 million of higher general administrative and other expenses 

higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased revpar and to a lesser extent unit growth the 15 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher propertylevel income resulting from higher propertylevel revenue and margins 

the 11 million increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a 14 million termination fee for one property in 2012 and 3 million of net stronger owned and leased property results primarily driven by 

 47 

two properties that left the system and had losses in the prior year partially offset by 7 million of termination fees for two properties in 2011 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 2 million and primarily reflected the accelerated amortization of 8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for the property for which we earned the 14 million termination fee and 2 million of miscellaneous cost increases partially offset by favorable variances from the following 2011 items a 5 million performance cure payment we made for one property a 2 million guarantee accrual for one property and the writeoff of contract acquisition costs totaling 2 million for two properties

the 6 million  increase in segment results compared to 2012 primarily reflected 45 million of higher base management and franchise fees and 4 million of higher incentive management fees partially offset by 43 million of lower gains and other income 

higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher revpar due to increased demand some of which was attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations and higher relicensing fees as well as the additional four days of activity partially offset by an unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of 7 million of deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture the increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher propertylevel revenue which resulted in higher propertylevel income and margins lower gains and other income primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from a 41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture in 2012 see the gains losses and other income caption earlier in this report for more information on the sale of this equity interest

the 90 million increase in segment results compared to 2011 primarily reflected 43 million of higher base management and franchise fees 41 million of higher gains and other income 4 million of decreased joint venture equity losses and 2 million of higher incentive management fees 

higher gains and other income reflected a 41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture 

higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected higher revpar due to increased demand some of which is attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations and to a lesser extent new unit growth and our recognition of 7 million of deferred base management fees in 2012 in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture 

the 4 million decrease in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected a favorable variance from the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture which had losses in the prior year

  the increase in general administrative and other expenses primarily reflected 14 million of increased expenses for initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally 7 million of higher accounts receivable reserves primarily related to two properties and a 5 million performance cure payment for one property partially offset by a favorable variance from a 5 million guarantee accrual for one property in 2012 

the decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses largely reflected 7 million in costs related to three international segment leases we terminated 5 million in weaker results at one leased property in london and 5 million in weaker results at a leased property due to an asset writeoff and the impact of renovations partially offset by 5 million of higher termination fees principally associated with one property

the 21 million decrease in general administrative and other expenses primarily reflected a favorable variance from a 5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a 5 million accounts receivable reserve both recognized in 2011 and both for one property whose owner filed for bankruptcy as well as 8 million of guarantee accrual reversals in 2012 for three properties for which we either satisfied the related guarantee requirements or were otherwise released 

the 8 million increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected a 9 million increase associated with our leased property in japan which experienced very low demand in 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami and received a 2 million business interruption payment in 2012 from a utility company 

the 4 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected new unit growth the 3 million increase in joint venture equity losses primarily reflected increased losses of 8 million principally for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties in 2012 partially offset by 5 million of decreased losses after the impairment as a result of decreased joint venture costs the 3 million decrease in gains and other income primarily reflected the impairment of a cost method joint venture investment 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our luxury segment properties totaled 1428 million in 2012 compared to 1350 million in 2011

sharebased compensation 

under our stock and cash incentive plan we award 1 stock options to purchase our common stock “stock option program” 2 stock appreciation rights “sars” for our common stock “stock appreciation right program” 3 restricted stock units “rsus” of our common stock and 4 deferred stock units we grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that equal the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

during 2013  we granted 25 million  rsus 02 million  service and performance rsus 07 million  employee sars and 01 million  stock options see footnote no 3 “sharebased compensation” for more information 

new accounting standards 

we do not expect that accounting standard updates issued to date and that are effective after december 31 2013 will have a material effect on our financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

on july 18 2013 we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement the credit facility to extend the facilitys expiration to july 18 2018 and increase the facility size to 2000 million  of aggregate effective borrowings the material terms of the amended and restated credit facility are otherwise unchanged the facility supports general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures and letters of credit the availability of the credit facility also supports our commercial paper program borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating for more information on our credit facility see exhibit 10 “third amended and restated credit agreement” to our current report on form 8k that we filed with the sec on july 19 2013 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations remain adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

we issue commercial paper in the united states we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper to affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2013  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1291 million  and reflected borrowing capacity of 1165 million  under our credit facility and our cash balance of 126 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 2000 million  of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting  834 million  of outstanding commercial paper and  1 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings issuances of senior notes and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

cash from operations 

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 07  to 10 at yearend 2013 and 05 to 10 at yearend 2012 we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

 53 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to this 2013 annual report on form 10k are as follows 

  



 timeshare cash flows 

while our former timeshare segment historically generated positive operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varied based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we included timeshare reportable sales we financed in cash from operations when we collected cash payments we show the 2011 net operating activity from our former timeshare segment before the spinoff which did not include income from our former timeshare segment in the following table new timeshare segment mortgages totaled  214 million  in 2011 and collections totaled  273 million  in 2011 which included collections on securitized notes of  187 million  



as noted in footnote no 2 “income taxes” all tax matters that could affect the companys cash tax benefits related to the 2011 spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business were resolved in the 2013 first quarter and we expect that the spinoff will result in our realization through 2015 of approximately 480 million of cash tax benefits relating to the value of the timeshare business we realized 363 million of cash tax benefits through 2013 of which 135 million of those benefits were realized in 2013 we expect to realize approximately   52 million in 2014 for more information on the spinoff see footnote no 15 spinoff 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 404 million  in 2013 437 million  in 2012 and 183 million  in 2011 these included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives capital expenditures in 2013 decreased by 33 million  compared to 2012 primarily due to the 2012 acquisition of land and a building we plan to develop into a hotel in our luxury segment partially offset by the 2013 acquisition of a managed property in our north american fullservice segment contract acquisition costs in 2013 decreased by 192 million  compared to 2012 primarily due to the 192 million acquisition of the gaylord hotel management company in 2012 separately we classified the 18 million acquisition of the gaylord brand name in 2012 as other investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2012 increased by 254 million  compared to 2011 primarily due to the acquisition of land and a building renovations of buildings associated with developing three edition hotels and the acquisition of land for an edition hotel contract acquisitions costs in 2012 increased by 179 million compared to 2011 primarily due to the 192 million acquisition of the gaylord hotel management company see footnote no 7 acquisitions and dispositions for more information on these acquisitions we expect 2014 investment spending will total approximately 800 million  to 1 billion  including approximately 150 million  for maintenance capital spending and approximately 186 million for protea investment spending also includes other capital expenditures including property acquisitions loan advances contract acquisition costs and equity and other investments 

 54 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations we expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because 1 we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated no  cash proceeds in 2013 65 million in 2012 and 20 million in 2011 see footnote no 7 acquisitions and dispositions for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan collections net of loan advances amounted to 70 million  in 2013 and 138 million in 2012 at yearend 2013  we had a 3 million longterm senior loan and 175 million of mezzanine and other loans 142 million longterm and 36 million shortterm outstanding compared with a 15 million longterm senior loan and 227 million of mezzanine and other loans 165 million longterm and 62 million shortterm outstanding at yearend 2012 in 2013 our notes receivable balance for senior mezzanine and other loans decreased by 64 million  primarily reflecting collections on two mvw notes receivable issued to us in 2011 in conjunction with the timeshare spinoff see the “senior mezzanine and other loans” caption in footnote no 1 summary of significant accounting policies 

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 16 million  in 2013 15 million  in 2012 and 83 million  in 2011 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures 

cash from financing activities 

debt debt increased by 264 million  in 2013  to 3199 million  at yearend 2013  from 2935 million at yearend 2012 and reflected our 2013 third quarter issuance of 348 million book value of series m senior notes and a 333 million  increase in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by the 400 million book value retirement at maturity of our series j senior notes 15 million  in decreased borrowings under our credit facility and decreases of  2 million  in other debt which includes capital leases   debt increased by 764 million in 2012 to 2935 million at yearend 2012 from 2171 million at yearend 2011 and reflected our 2012 issuance of 594 million book value of series k senior notes our 2012 issuance of 349 million book value of series l senior notes a 170 million increase in commercial paper and 15 million of borrowings under our credit facility partially offset by the 348 million book value retirement at maturity of our series f senior notes and decreases of 16 million in other debt which includes capital leases see footnote no 10 longterm debt for additional information on the debt issuances 

  our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2013 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 35 percent and an average maturity of approximately 51 years the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 07 to 10 at yearend 2013 

see the “cash requirements and our credit facilities” caption within this “liquidity and capital resources” section for more information on our credit facility

other activities 

credit card programs at yearend 2012 we had six credit card programs in the united states canada and the united kingdom which include both marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards credit cards we earn licensing fees based on card usage and the cards are designed to encourage loyalty to our brands 

sales and marketing loyalty programs and reservation systems we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ®  best rate guarantee gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our website or any other marriott reservation channel our strong marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and our informationrich and easytouse marriottcom website are also key to our success 

with nearly 34 million visitors each month and 81 billion in annual propertylevel gross revenues marriottcom remains one of the largest online retail sites in the world and one of the fastest growing sales channels in our system in 2012 continued improvements to our mobile services helped marriott mobile become the third largest mobile commerce platform after amazoncom and apple according to internet retailer september 2012 we continue to enhance our mobile offerings to make it easier for our guests to find and book our hotels on the go and enhance their experiences during their stay in 2012 we introduced marriottjp adding japanese language capability to our online platforms together with spanish german french and chinese our guests now have a wider selection of languages with which to discover our properties 

we are a founding venture partner along with five other major hotel chains in roomkeycom an industry online referral and lead generation site roomkeycom launched in january 2012 and allows consumers to research hotel options across multiple brands when a roomkeycom customer selects a hotel with one of our brands the customer books directly on marriottcom we expect roomkeycom will be a more costeffective and efficient business model for properties in our system than other online travel sites 

at yearend 2012 we operated 15  systemwide hotel reservation centers eight  in the united states and canada and seven  in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective with over 3800 properties in our system economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and franchisees and enhance our fee revenue

as we further discuss in part i item 1a “risk factors” later in this report we utilize sophisticated technology and systems in our reservation revenue management and property management systems in our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and in other aspects of our business we also make certain technologies available to our guests keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position furthermore the integrity and protection of customer employee and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency 

environmental responsibility and green hotels building on more than 20 years of energy conservation experience we are committed to protecting the environment our “spirit to preserve ® ” environmental strategy calls for greening our multibillion dollar supply chain further reducing fuel and water consumption empowering our hotel development partners to build green hotels educating and inspiring employees and guests to conserve and preserve and investing in innovative largescale conservation projects worldwide 

we were the first in the hospitality industry to launch a series of green hotel prototypes that have been preapproved by us green building council “usgbc” as part of its leadership in energy and environment design “leed” volume program meaning that any hotel that follows these plans will earn basic leed ®  certification or possibly higher upon final 

usgbc approval while also reducing energy and water consumption up to 25 percent we are also the first in our industry to offer a green hotel prototype for five brands courtyard springhill suites fairfield inn  suites residence inn and towneplace suites our first two leed volume hotels the courtyard scottsdale salt river in arizona and the towneplace suites denver airport at gateway park in colorado opened in the second quarter of 2012 we also opened the courtyard kansas city at briarcliff in missouri in the third quarter of 2012 and the towneplace suites frederick in frederick maryland in the fourth quarter of 2012 nine additional leed volume hotel projects are in development or under construction 

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

marriott golf at yearend 2012 marriott golf managed 37  golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners in addition we provide certain services to six facilities operated by others 

competition we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor there are approximately 850 lodging management companies in the united states including approximately 10 that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

during the recent recession we experienced a significant reduction in demand for hotel rooms particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally improved in 2010 2011 and 2012 additional cost reductions could become necessary to preserve operating margins if demand trends reverse if any such efforts become necessary we would expect to implement them in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction in order to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry and we believe that our brand recognition gives us a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining guests owners and franchisees in 2012 approximately 69 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is concentrated with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have approximately a ten percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate a one percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the properties properties converting to one of our brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

employee relations 

at yearend 2012 we had approximately 127000 employees approximately 9900 of whom were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation of properties and our development of properties comply in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations our compliance with such provisions also has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material impact in the future

forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statement the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report or in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties for customers  we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services including our loyalty programs and consumerfacing technology platforms and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas our operating margins could contract our market share could decrease and our earnings could decline 

economic uncertainty could continue to impact our financial results and growth  weak economic conditions in europe and other parts of the world the strength or continuation of recovery in countries that have experienced improved economic conditions potential disruptions in the us economy as a result of governmental action or inaction on the federal deficit budget and related issues political instability in some areas and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions will continue could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging industry us government travel is also a significant part of our business and our business could suffer if budgetrelated decisions reduce the amount of travel by us government employees and contractors or place restrictions on aspects of travel as a result of such current economic conditions and uncertainty we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets recent improvements in demand trends in other markets may not continue and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery stalls or conditions worsen 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which the company fails or elects not to cure a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

our lodging operations are subject to global regional and national conditions  because we conduct our business on a global platform our activities are affected by changes in global and regional economies in recent years our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future performance could be similarly affected by the economic environment in each of the regions in which we operate the resulting unknown pace of business travel and the occurrence of any future incidents in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the united states also makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business  we currently operate or franchise hotels and resorts in 74  countries and our operations outside the united states 

represented approximately 16  percent of our revenues in 2012  we expect that the international share of our total revenues will increase in future years as a result we are increasingly exposed to the challenges and risks of doing business outside the united states which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions or otherwise disrupt our business these challenges include 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of governments that may impact our operations such as foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us and foreign laws that affect the activities of companies abroad such as anticorruption laws competition laws currency regulations and laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax effective manner 4 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 5 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws 6 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest in the middle east and elsewhere acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 7 currency exchange rate fluctuations 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful  we cannot assure you that our recently launched edition autograph collection and ac hotels by marriott brands our recent acquisition of the gaylord brand or any new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other customers we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring the brands or any new programs or products or that the brands or any new programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other natural disasters and manmade disasters in recent years such as hurricane sandy in the northeastern united states the earthquake and tsunami in japan and the spread of contagious diseases in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers could cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest or civil strife such as recent events in syria egypt libya and bahrain and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

disagreements with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or may delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product or service initiatives such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but are not always able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations  events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands if the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be affected 

actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties in connection with lodging timeshare and residential services under the terms of their agreements with us our franchisees and licensees interact directly with customers and other third parties under our brand and trade names if these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances pursuing any such recourse remedy or termination could be expensive and time consuming  in addition we cannot assure you that a court would ultimately enforce our contractual termination rights in every instance 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance  we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations for the property 

development and financing risks 

while  w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary  in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control the difficulty of obtaining financing on attractive terms or at all continues to constrain the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we develop new hotel and residential properties and previously developed timeshare interval and fractional ownership properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the 2009 and 2011 impairment charges for our former timeshare business our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to further decreases in demand for residential properties increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks  partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate either directly or through noncontrolling interests andor licensing agreements in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including residences and condominiums under our the ritzcarlton edition jw marriott autograph collection and marriott brand names and trademarks such projects pose further risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging businesses which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 1 the continued weakness in residential real estate and demand generally may continue to reduce our profits and could make it more difficult to convince future hotel development partners of the value added by our brands 2 increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the costs of residential ownership could prevent potential customers from buying residential products or reduce the prices they are willing to pay and 3 residential construction may be subject to warranty and liability claims and the costs of resolving such claims may be significant 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis and if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s look no further ®  best rate guarantee has helped prevent customer preference shift to the intermediaries and greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  yahoo ®  and baidu ®  to steer customers toward their websites a practice that has been challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely in addition recent class action litigation against several online travel intermediaries and lodging companies including marriott challenges the legality under antitrust law of contract provisions that support programs such as marriotts look no further ®  best rate guarantee and we cannot assure you that the courts will ultimately uphold such provisions our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from marriottcom or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels 

failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions operational inefficiencies damage to our reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits  our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services including in areas such as human resources outsourcing website hosting and various forms of electronic communications we and third parties who provide services to us also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to us if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information the information security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation and the requirements of the payment card industry are also increasingly demanding in both the united states and other jurisdictions where we operate our systems may not be able to 

satisfy these changing requirements and employee and customer expectations or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so efforts to hack or breach security measures failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended viruses operator error or inadvertent releases of data all threaten our and our service providers information systems and records our reliance on computer internetbased and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to such systems have increased significantly in recent years a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines or litigation a breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws on marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

other risks 

changes in tax and other laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs  our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world in response to the economic environment we anticipate that many of the jurisdictions in which we do business will continue to review tax and other revenue raising laws regulations and policies and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our nonus operations or that could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured for example most us company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the united states is generally taxed at local rates which are often much lower than us tax rates if changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations significantly increase the tax rates on nonus income our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced if such increases resulted from our status as a us company those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our nonus competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates 

the 2011 spinoff of our former timeshare business could result in significant tax liability to us and our shareholders  as discussed in more detail in footnote no 16 spinoff to our financial statements in 2011 we completed the spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business although we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs and an opinion from our tax counsel confirming that the distribution of mvw common stock will not result in the recognition for us federal income tax purposes of income gain or loss to us or our shareholders except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares of mvw common stock the private letter ruling and opinion that we received are subject to the continuing validity of any assumptions and representations reflected therein in addition an opinion from our tax counsel is not binding on the irs or a court moreover certain future events that may or may not be within our control including certain extraordinary purchases of our stock or mvws stock could cause the distribution not to qualify as taxfree accordingly the irs could determine that the distribution of the mvw common stock was a taxable transaction and a court could agree with the irs if the distribution of the mvw common stock was determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders who received shares of mvw common stock in the spinoff could incur significant tax liabilities under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that we entered into with mvw we are entitled to indemnification from mvw for certain taxes and related losses resulting from the failure of the distribution of mvw common stock to qualify as taxfree as a result of 1 any breach by mvw or its subsidiaries of the covenants on the preservation of the taxfree status of the distribution 2 certain acquisitions of equity securities or assets of mvw or its subsidiaries and 3 any breach by mvw or its subsidiaries of certain representations in the documents submitted to the irs and the separation documents relating to the spinoff if however the distribution failed to qualify as a taxfree transaction for reasons other than those specified in the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement liability for any resulting taxes for the distribution would be apportioned between us and mvw based on our relative fair market values 

the 2011 spinoff also might not produce the cash tax benefits we anticipate  in connection with the spinoff we completed an internal reorganization which included transactions that were structured in a manner intended to result for us federal income tax purposes in our recognition of builtin losses in properties used in the north american and luxury 

segments of the timeshare division our recognition of these builtin losses and corresponding tax deductions has generated and we expect will continue to generate significant cash tax benefits for us although we received a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion from our tax counsel confirming that these builtin losses may be recognized and deducted by us the private letter ruling and opinion that we received are subject to the continuing validity of any assumptions and representations reflected therein accordingly the irs could determine that the builtin losses should not have been recognized or deductions for such losses should be disallowed and a court could agree with the irs if we were unable to deduct these losses for us federal income tax purposes and instead the tax basis of the properties attributable to the builtin losses were available to mvw and its subsidiaries mvw has agreed pursuant to the tax sharing and indemnification agreement to indemnify us for certain tax benefits that we otherwise have recognized or would have recognized if we were able to deduct such losses for more information on the cash tax benefits we anticipate see the liquidity and capital resources caption within part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes for mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder’s rights plan

business and overview 

lodging business 

we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 74  countries and territories under numerous brand names we also develop operate and market residential properties and provide services to homecondominium owner associations at yearend 2012 we had 3801  properties  660394  rooms in our system including 35  home and condominium products  3927  units for which we manage the related owners’ associations at yearend 2012 we grouped our operations into four business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging and luxury lodging 

we earn base management fees and in some cases incentive management fees from the hotels that we manage and we earn franchise fees on the hotels that others operate under franchise agreements with us base fees typically consist of a percentage of propertylevel revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit house profit less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance real estate taxes capital spending reserves and the like 

we use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate either in conjunction with hotel development or on a standalone basis under our the ritzcarlton edition jw marriott autograph collection and marriott brand names thirdparty developers typically build and sell residences with little if any of our capital at risk while the worldwide residential market is very large the luxurious nature of our residential properties the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands and the hospitality services that we provide all serve to make our residential properties distinctive 

under our business model we typically manage or franchise hotels rather than own them at yearend 2012 we operated 43  percent of the hotel rooms in our worldwide system under management agreements our franchisees operated 54  percent under franchise agreements unconsolidated joint ventures that we have an interest in held management and provided services to franchised properties for 1  percent and we owned or leased only 2  percent 

our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while adding new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility 

we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control costs both at companyoperated properties and at the corporate level aboveproperty our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams dedicated associates superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction significant distribution our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards loyalty programs a multichannel reservations system and desirable property amenities we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we address through various means hotels in the system that do not meet standards 

we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse website marriottcom and of our associated mobile smartphone applications that connect to marriottcom through functionality and service improvements and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of propertylevel reservations via this costefficient channel in 2012 we introduced marriottjp adding japanese language capability to our online platforms together with spanish german french and chinese our guests now have a wider selection of languages with which to discover our properties online 

our profitability as well as that of owners and franchisees has benefited from our approach to propertylevel and aboveproperty productivity properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls we also control aboveproperty costs some of which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas 

lodging performance measures 

we believe revpar which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues references to revpar throughout this report are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted we calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

we also believe companyoperated house profit margin which is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit also known as house profit to total propertylevel revenue is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

lodging results   

conditions for our lodging business continued to improve in 2012 reflecting generally low supply growth a favorable economic climate in many markets around the world the impact of operating efficiencies across our company and a yearoveryear increase in the number of hotels demand was strong in most north american markets constrained somewhat in washington dc due to weak government demand associated with government spending restrictions and a shorter congressional calendar the dc market also experienced the customarily lower demand levels in 2012 associated with an election year although leisure and group business were strong in the summer months 

in europe many economies continue to struggle although our properties there benefited from strong international arrivals in addition our hotels benefited from the olympic games in london the euro cup soccer championship in warsaw and a strong fair calendar in germany demand was weak in european markets more dependent on regional travel and new supply constrained revpar growth in a few european markets demand was strong in the united arab emirates and improved modestly but remained weak in egypt jordan kuwait and oman demand in the asia pacific region continued to be strong particularly for properties in thailand china and indonesia demand in china in 2012 moderated somewhat as the year progressed reflecting declines in government related travel ahead of the countrys change in leadership moderating economic growth and new supply in several markets   revpar in india softened throughout 2012 reflecting the countrys more challenging economic environment and increased supply 

compared to 2011 2012 worldwide average daily rates increased 39  percent on a constant dollar basis to 13749  for comparable systemwide properties revpar increased 61  percent to 9734  and occupancy increased 15  percentage points to 708  percent 

we monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual hotel demand levels generally increasing room rates as demand increases we also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2012 which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets this mix improvement benefited average daily rates our companyoperated properties continuously monitor costs as we focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins and actively pursue productivity improvements 

the hotels in our system serve both transient and group customers overall business transient and leisure transient demand was strong in 2012 group demand improved in 2012 group customers spent more on their meetings and group related propertylevel food and beverage volumes improved additionally we saw an increase in shortterm bookings for both large and small groups during 2012 and attendance at meetings frequently exceeded initial projections typically twothirds of group business is booked before the year of arrival and onethird is booked in the year of arrival during an economic recovery group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings group business booked in earlier periods at lower rates continues to roll off and with improving group demand is replaced with bookings reflecting generally higher rates projected group revenue for 2013 for comparable north american marriott hotels  resorts properties is up six percent yearoveryear with more than half of the growth coming from rate 

negotiated corporate business “special corporate business” represented nearly 15 percent of our fullservice managed hotel room nights for 2012 in north america in negotiating pricing for this segment of business we do not focus strictly on volume but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our business customers including for example stay patterns day of week and season locations of stays nonroom spend and aggregate spend in order to maximize propertylevel earnings for 2013 we expect to complete negotiations with our special corporate business nationalaccounts clients in the first quarter with approximately 85 percent of our negotiations complete on average room rates for comparable customers are approximately five percent higher in 2013 than the prior year 

lodging transactions 

on october 1 2012 we acquired the gaylord brand and hotel management company from gaylord entertainment company now called ryman hospitality properties inc ryman hospitality for 210 million  ryman hospitality continues to own the gaylord hotels which we manage under the gaylord brand under longterm management agreements this transaction added four  hotels and approximately 7800  rooms to our north american fullservice segment and included our entering into management agreements for several attractions at the gaylord opryland in nashville consisting of a showboat a golf course and a saloon as part of the transaction on december 1 2012 we also assumed management of another hotel owned by ryman hospitality the inn at opryland with approximately 300  rooms 

in 2012 we completed the sale of our execustay ®  corporate housing business neither the sales price nor the gain we recognized was material to our results of operations and cash flows the revenues results of operations assets and liabilities of our execustay business also were not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows for any of the periods presented and accordingly we have not reflected execustay as a discontinued operation 

in 2012 we completed the sale of our equity interest in a north american limitedservice joint venture formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale and we amended certain provisions of the management agreements for the underlying hotel portfolio as a result of this transaction we received cash proceeds of 96 million  including 30 million  of proceeds which is refundable over the term of the management agreements if the hotel portfolio does not meet certain quarterly hotel performance thresholds to the extent the hotel portfolio meets the quarterly hotel performance thresholds we will recognize the 30 million  of proceeds over the remaining term of the management agreements as base fee revenue in 2012 we recognized a gain of 41 million  which consisted of 1 20 million  for the recognition of the gain we deferred in 2005 because we retained the equity interest following the original sale of land to one of the joint ventures and because there were contingencies associated with the 2005 transaction that expired with this sale and 2 21 million  for the gain on the sale of the equity interest we also recognized base management fee revenue totaling 7 million  in 2012 primarily that we had deferred in earlier periods but which we earned in conjunction with the sale 

see footnote no 7 acquisitions and dispositions to our financial statements for more information on these lodging transactions 

timeshare spinoff and timeshare strategyimpairment charges 

on november 21 2011 the spinoff date we completed a spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special taxfree dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary mvw under license agreements with us mvw is both the exclusive developer and operator of timeshare fractional and related products under the marriott brand and the exclusive developer of fractional and related products under the ritzcarlton brand we now earn license fees under these agreements that we include in franchise fees we do not allocate mvw license fees to any of our segments and instead include them in other unallocated corporate 

because of our significant continuing involvement in mvw operations after the spinoff by virtue of the license and other agreements between us and mvw we continue to include the historical financial results before the spinoff of our former timeshare segment in our historical financial results as a component of continuing operations 

before the spinoff we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 324 million   234 million  aftertax in our 2011 income statement under the timeshare strategyimpairment charges caption please see footnote no 16 “spinoff” to our financial statements and “part i item 1a – risk factors other risks” for more information on the spinoff and the impairment charges 

consolidated results 

as noted in the preceding business and overview section we completed the spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business in late 2011 accordingly we no longer have a timeshare segment and instead now earn license fees that we do not allocate to any of our segments and include in other unallocated corporate the following tables 

detail the components of our former timeshare segment revenues and results for 2011 as well as certain items that we did not allocate to our timeshare segment for 2011 and also shows the components of revenue interest income and interest expense we received from mvw for 2012 



 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2012  2011  and 2010  the results for 2011 included the results of the former timeshare segment before the spinoff date while 2010 included the former timeshare segment for the entire fiscal year see business segments timeshare later in this report for more information 

revenues 

2012 compared to 2011 

revenues decreased by 503 million   4 percent  to 11814 million  in 2012 from 12317 million  in 2011 as detailed in the preceding table the spinoff contributed to a net 1282 million  decrease in revenues that was partially offset by a 779 million  increase in revenues in our lodging business 

the 779 million  increase in revenues for our lodging business was a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue  757 million  higher franchise fees  44 million  higher incentive management fees  37 million  comprised of an 18 million increase for north america and a 19 million increase outside of north america and higher base management fees  35 million  partially offset by lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue  94 million  which includes a 70 million reduction from our sold corporate housing business as further discussed later in this section 

the 562 million  increase in total cost reimbursements revenue to 9405 million  in 2012 from 8843 million  in 2011 reflected a 757 million  increase allocated across our lodging business resulting from higher propertylevel demand and growth across our system partially offset by a net 195 million  decline in timesharerelated cost reimbursements due to the spinoff 

the 21 million  decrease in total base management fees to 581 million  in 2012 from 602 million  in 2011 primarily reflected a decline of 56 million  in former timeshare segment 51 million and international segment 5 million base management fees due to the spinoff partially offset by a net increase of 35 million  across our lodging business the 35 million  net increase in base management fees across our lodging business primarily reflected stronger revpar 24 million and the impact of unit growth across the system 9 million as well as recognition in the 2012 third quarter of 7 million of previously deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a north americanlimited service joint venture partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates 3 million and the unfavorable impact of 3 million of fee reversals in 2012 for two properties to reflect contract revisions the 101 million  increase in total franchise fees to 607 million  in 2012 from 506 million  in 2011 primarily reflected an increase of 57 million  in license fees from mvw and an increase of 44 million  across our lodging business primarily as a result of stronger revpar 27 million and the impact of unit growth across the system 13 million 

the 37 million  increase in incentive management fees from 195 million  in 2011 to 232 million  in 2012 primarily reflected higher net propertylevel income 30 million new unit growth net of terminations 6 million recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain international segment properties 3 million and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an international segment propertys change in ownership 3 million partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates 4 million in 2012 33 percent  of our managed properties paid us incentive management fees versus 29 percent in 2011 in addition in 2012 65 percent  of our incentive fees came from properties outside the united states versus 67 percent in 2011 in north america 14 north american fullservice segment properties seven north american limitedservice segment properties and two luxury segment properties earned a combined 13 million in incentive management fees in 2012 but did not earn any incentive management fees in 2011 

the 94 million  decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue to 989 million  in 2012 from 1083 million  in 2011 primarily reflected 70 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the execustay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter 29 million of lower owned and leased revenue and 3 million of lower termination fees partially offset by 7 million of higher branding fees and 3 million of higher other revenue the 29 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected 1 34 million of lower revenue at several owned and leased properties in our international segment primarily driven by three hotels that left the system 18 million weaker demand at three other hotels 6 million two hotels that are no longer leased but remain within our system as managed or franchised properties 5 million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates 5 million and 2 23 million of lower revenue at a north american fullservice segment property that converted from leased to managed at yearend 2011 partially offset by 3 14 million of higher revenue at one leased property in london due to strong demand in part associated with the 2012 third quarter olympic games and 4 10 million of higher revenue at one leased property in japan the property in japan benefited from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a 2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled 106 million in 2012 and 99 million in 2011 

2011 compared to 2010 

revenues increased by 626 million 5 percent to 12317 million in 2011 from 11691 million in 2010 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue 604 million base management and franchise fees 105 million owned leased corporate housing and other revenue 37 million and incentive management fees 13 million all from properties outside of north america these favorable variances were partially offset by lower timeshare sales and services revenue 133 million 

the increases in base management fees to 602 million in 2011 from 562 million in 2010 and in franchise fees to 506 million in 2011 from 441 million in 2010 primarily reflected stronger revpar and to a lesser extent the impact of unit growth across our system and favorable foreign exchange rates base management fees in 2011 included 51 million for the timeshare business compared to 55 million in the prior year franchise fees in 2011 included 4 million for mvw license fees the increase in incentive management fees from 182 million in 2010 to 195 million in 2011 primarily reflected higher net propertylevel income resulting from higher propertylevel revenue and continued propertylevel cost controls and to a lesser extent new unit growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange rates 

the increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue to 1083 million in 2011 from 1046 million in 2010 reflected 21 million of higher total branding fees 7 million of higher corporate housing revenue 4 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees and 3 million of higher other revenue combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled 99 million in 2011 and 78 million in 2010 

the decrease in timeshare sales and services revenue to 1088 million in 2011 from 1221 million in 2010 primarily reflected 1 49 million of lower development revenue reflecting the spinoff and to a lesser extent lower sales volumes partially offset by   favorable reportability primarily for sales reserves recorded in 2010 2 45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income resulting from the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to mvw in conjunction with the spinoff as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance before the spinoff date 3 32 million of lower other revenue primarily reflecting the spinoff and lower resales revenue and 4 7 million of lower services revenue reflecting the spinoff partially offset by   increased rental occupancies and rates before the spinoff date see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for more information on our former timeshare segment 

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income the increase in cost reimbursements revenue to 8843 million in 2011 from 8239 million in 2010 reflected the impact of higher propertylevel demand and growth across the system 

operating income 

2012 compared to 2011 

operating income increased by 414 million  to 940 million  in 2012 from 526 million  in 2011 the 414 million  increase in operating income reflected a net 265 million  favorable variance due to the spinoff which included 324 million of timeshare strategyimpairment charges in 2011 as detailed in the preceding table and a 149 million  increase across our lodging business this 149 million  increase across our lodging business reflected a 44 million  increase in franchise fees a 37 million  increase in incentive management fees a 35 million  increase in base management fees 25 million  of higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses and an 8 million  decrease in general administrative and other expenses we discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees franchise fees and incentive management fees across our lodging business compared to 2011 in the preceding “revenues” section 

the 25 million   18 percent  increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to 19 million of net stronger results particularly at one leased property in japan 9 million and one leased property in london 8 million 7 million of higher branding fees and 3 million of higher other revenue partially offset by 3 million of lower termination fees our leased property in london benefited from strong demand and higher propertylevel margins in 2012 in part associated with the 2012 third quarter olympic games while our leased property in japan experienced strong demand in 2012 benefiting from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a 2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company 

general administrative and other expenses decreased by 107 million   14 percent  to 645 million  in 2012 from 752 million  in 2011 the 107 million  decrease reflected a decline of 99 million  due to the spinoff consisting of 63 million  of former timeshare segment general administrative and other expenses and 36 million of other expenses not previously allocated to the former timeshare segment including 34 million  of timeshare spinoff costs and 2 million  of other 

expenses and a decline of 8 million  across our lodging business the 8 million  decrease across our lodging business was primarily a result of 1 favorable variances from the following 2011 items a a 5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a 5 million accounts receivable reserve both for one luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy b a 5 million performance cure payment for a north american fullservice property and c 8 million for a guarantee accrual for one north american fullservice property and the writeoff of contract acquisition costs for several other properties and 2 11 million of guarantee accrual reversals in 2012 primarily associated with four properties for which we either satisfied the related guarantee requirements or were otherwise released 3 a favorable litigation settlement partially offset by higher legal expenses netting to a favorable 3 million and 4 2 million in decreased expenses due to favorable foreign exchange rates these favorable items were partially offset by 1 the following unfavorable 2012 items a 20 million of increased compensation and other overhead expenses and b the accelerated amortization of 8 million of deferred contract acquisitions costs for a north american fullservice segment property for which we earned a termination fee that we recorded in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue and 2 the unfavorable variance for a 5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision for one property with increased expected future cash flows see business segments north american fullservice lodging for more information on the termination fee and the related accelerated amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs recorded in 2012 

the 8 million  decrease in total general administrative and other expenses across our lodging business consisted of a 21 million decrease allocated to our luxury segment partially offset by an 11 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments and a 2 million increase allocated to our north american fullservice segment 

2011 compared to 2010 

operating income decreased by 169 million to 526 million in 2011 from 695 million in 2010 the decrease reflected 324 million of 2011 timeshare strategyimpairment charges and 40 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by a 105 million increase in base management and franchise fees 49 million of higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses a 28 million decrease in general administrative and other expenses and 13 million of higher incentive management fees we address the reasons for the increases in base management and franchise fees and in incentive management fees in the preceding “revenues” section 

the 49 million 54 percent increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to 21 million of higher branding fees 15 million of net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher revpar and propertylevel margins 6 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees net of 2010 termination costs 6 million of higher corporate housing and other revenue net of expenses and 5 million of decreased rent expense partially offset by 4 million of lower results at a leased hotel in japan that experienced lower demand as a result of the earthquake and tsunami earlier in the year 

general administrative and other expenses decreased by 28 million 4 percent to 752 million in 2011 from 780 million in 2010 the decrease primarily reflected favorable variances from the following 2010 items an 84 million longlived asset impairment charge for a capitalized revenue management software asset which we did not allocate to any of our segments a 13 million longlived asset impairment charge allocated to our former timeshare segment and a 14 million longlived asset impairment charge allocated to our north american limitedservice segment also contributing to the decrease in expenses was 9 million of lower former timeshare segment expenses due to the spinoff and a 5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision for one property with increased expected future cash flows these favorable variances were partially offset by the following 2011 items 34 million of transactionrelated expenses for the spinoff of the timeshare business 17 million of higher compensation costs 10 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets and initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally a 5 million impairment of contract acquisition costs and a 5 million accounts receivable reserve both for one luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy a 5 million performance cure payment for a north american fullservice property and 7 million for an increase in the guarantee reserves for one international and one north american fullservice property primarily due to cash flow shortfalls at those properties and a 2 million writeoff of contract acquisition costs for two other properties the favorable variances were further offset by the following 2010 items a 4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the united states and a 6 million reversal of guarantee accruals primarily for a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements 

the 28 million decrease in total general administrative and other expenses consisted of a 34 million decrease that we did not allocate to any of our segments a 22 million decrease allocated to our former timeshare segment and a 12 million decrease allocated to our north american limitedservice segment partially offset by a 20 million increase allocated to our luxury segment a 15 million increase allocated to our international segment and a 5 million increase allocated to our north american fullservice segment 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses totaled 159 million in 2011 and 199 million in 2010 the decrease of 40 million as compared to 2010 primarily reflected 28 million of lower other revenue net of expenses and 25 million of lower financing revenue net of expenses partially offset by 8 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 5 million of higher services revenue net of expenses the 28 million decrease in other revenue net of expenses primarily reflected a 15 million unfavorable variance from an adjustment to the marriott rewards liability in 2010 and to a lesser extent in 2011 the impact of the spinoff as well as lower resales revenue net of expenses due to lower closings the 25 million decrease in financing revenue net of expenses primarily reflected decreased interest income due to the spinoff as well as lower notes receivable balances before the spinoff date higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected favorable reportability as well as a favorable variance from a net 12 million reserve in the prior year partially offset by lower 2011 sales volumes as well as the impact of the spinoff see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for more information on our former timeshare segment before spinoff 

gains losses and other income 

we show our gains losses and other income for 2012 2011 and 2010 in the following table   



2012 compared to 2011 

in 2012 we recognized a total gain of 41 million on the sale of an equity interest in a north american limitedservice joint venture formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale which consisted of 1 a 21 million gain on the sale of this interest reflected in the net gain on sale of joint venture and other investments caption in the preceding table and 2 recognition of the 20 million remaining gain we deferred in 2005 due to contingencies in the original transaction documents for the sale of land to one of the joint ventures reflected in the net gain on sale of real estate and other caption in the preceding table see footnote no 7 acquisitions and dispositions to the financial statements for more information on the sale of this equity interest 

the impairment of cost method joint venture investments and equity securities line in the preceding table reflects the otherthantemporary impairment in 2012 of two cost method joint venture investments and the otherthantemporary impairment in 2011 of marketable equity securities for more information on the 7 million impairment of one of the cost method joint venture investments in 2012 and the impairment of marketable equity securities in 2011 see footnote no 4 “fair value of financial instruments” to the financial statements 

2011 compared to 2010 

the 23 million decrease in net gain on sale of real estate and other primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from an 18 million gain on the sale of one timeshare segment property in 2010 the 18 million impairment in 2011 shown in the impairment of cost method joint venture investments and equity securities caption in the preceding table reflects an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable securities as discussed previously under the  2012 compared to 2011    caption 

interest expense 

2012 compared to 2011 

interest expense decreased by 27 million   16 percent  to 137 million  in 2012 compared to 164 million  in 2011 this decrease reflected a 29 million decrease due to the spinoff partially offset by a 2 million increase for our lodging business the 29 million decrease in interest expense due to the spinoff consisted of interest expense in 2011 that was allocated to the former timeshare segment  43 million  partially offset by interest expense in 2012 for ongoing obligations for costs that were a component of timesharedirect expenses before the spinoff  8 million  and the unfavorable variance to 2011 for capitalized interest expense for construction projects for our former timeshare segment  6 million  for the 8 million  of interest expense in 2012 for ongoing spinoff obligations we also recorded 8 million of interest income in 2012 for the 

associated notes receivable the 2 million  increase in interest expense for our lodging business was primarily for the series k notes and the series l notes we issued in 2012 23 million as well as increased interest expense for our marriott rewards program and our commercial paper program reflecting higher average balances and interest rates 2 million partially offset by increased capitalized interest expense principally for lodging construction projects 15 million and the absence of interest expense for the series f senior notes following our repayment of those notes in 2012 9 million see the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report for more information on our credit facility 

2011 compared to 2010 

interest expense decreased by 16 million 9 percent to 164 million in 2011 compared to 180 million in 2010 this decrease was primarily driven by 1 a 12 million decrease in interest expense on securitized notes reflecting the transfer of these notes to mvw on the spinoff date as well as a lower average outstanding balance and a lower average interest rate on those notes before the spinoff date 2 a 2 million increase in capitalized interest associated with construction projects and 3 a 1 million decrease in interest expense for our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program reflecting lower interest rates 

interest income and income tax 

2012 compared to 2011 

interest income increased by 3 million   21 percent  to 17 million  in 2012 compared to 14 million  in 2011 primarily reflecting 9 million of increased interest income for two notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spinoff partially offset by a 6 million decrease primarily from the repayment of certain loans for 8 million of the 9 million increase in interest income in 2012 for notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spinoff we also recorded 8 million  of interest expense in 2012 for ongoing obligations for those notes 

our tax provision increased by 120 million   76 percent  to 278 million  in 2012 from 158 million  in 2011 the increase was primarily due to the absence of timeshare pretax losses in 2012 due to the spinoff and the effect of higher pretax income from our lodging business as well as a lower percentage of lodging pretax income in 2012 from jurisdictions outside the us with lower tax rates these increases in the provision were partially offset by a favorable variance from 34 million of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to write off certain deferred tax assets transferred to mvw in conjunction with the spinoff as discussed under the following  2011 compared to 2010    caption 

2011 compared to 2010 

interest income decreased by 5 million 26 percent to 14 million in 2011 compared to 19 million in 2010 primarily reflecting a 3 million decrease from the repayment of certain loans 

our tax provision increased by 65 million 70 percent to 158 million in 2011 from 93 million in 2010 the increase was primarily due to an unfavorable variance related to a prior year irs settlement on the treatment of funds received from certain nonus subsidiaries that resulted in an 85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010 and 34 million of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to write off certain deferred tax assets that we transferred to mvw in conjunction with the spinoff we impaired these assets because we considered it more likely than not that mvw will be unable to realize the value of those deferred tax assets please see footnote no 16 spinoff to our financial statements for more information on the transaction the increases were partially offset by lower pretax income in 2011 

equity in losses 

2012 compared to 2011 

equity in losses of 13 million  in 2012 was unchanged from equity in losses of 13 million  in 2011 and reflected a 4 million  decrease in equity in losses across our lodging business entirely offset by a 4 million  unfavorable variance due to the impact of the spinoff the 4 million  decrease in equity in losses across our lodging business primarily reflected 3 million of increased earnings at two international segment joint ventures 3 million of decreased losses at two other joint ventures and a 3 million favorable variance from the 2012 sale of an equity interest in a north american limitedservice joint venture formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale which had losses in the prior year partially offset by 3 million of increased losses at a luxury segment joint venture and a 2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from another luxury segment joint venture the 3 million of increased losses at a luxury segment joint venture reflected increased losses of 8 million primarily from the impairment of certain underlying residential properties in 2012 partially offset by 5 million of decreased losses in 2012 after the impairment as a result of decreased joint venture costs the 4 

million  unfavorable variance due to the impact of the spinoff reflected the 4 million reversal in 2011 of the funding liability associated with timesharestrategy impairment charges we originally recorded in 2009 see footnote no 18 timeshare strategyimpairment charges of our 2011 form 10k for additional information on this reversal 

2011 compared to 2010 

equity in losses of 13 million in 2011 decreased by 5 million from equity in losses of 18 million in 2010 and primarily reflected 9 million of increased earnings at two north american limitedservice joint ventures and one international segment joint venture primarily due to stronger propertylevel performance 8 million of lower losses for a residential and fractional project joint venture our former timeshare segment stopped recognizing their share of the joint venture’s losses as their investment including loans due from the joint venture was reduced to zero in 2010 and a favorable variance from 2010 joint venture impairment charges of 5 million for our north american limitedservice segment these favorable impacts were partially offset by 8 million of decreased earnings at two luxury segment joint ventures we also reversed 4 million in 2011 and 11 million in 2010 of the 27 million funding liability we initially recorded in the timeshare strategyimpairment charges nonoperating caption of our 2009 income statement see footnote no 18 timeshare strategyimpairment charges of the notes to our financial statements of the 2011 form 10k for more information we recorded both the 11 million reversal in 2010 and the 4 million reversal in 2011 based on facts and circumstances surrounding a project related to our former timeshare segment including continued progress on certain constructionrelated legal claims and potential funding of certain costs by one of the partners 

net income 

2012 compared to 2011 

net income increased by 373 million  to 571 million  in 2012 from 198 million  in 2011 and diluted earnings per share increased by 117  per share  213 percent  to 172  per share from 055  per share in 2011 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “revenues” the 373 million  increase in net income was due to the impact of the spinoff  296 million  as well as the following increases across our lodging business higher gains and other income  52 million  higher franchise fees  44 million  higher incentive management fees  37 million  higher base management fees  35 million  higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses  25 million  lower general administrative and other expenses  8 million  and lower equity in losses  4 million  these increases were partially offset by higher income taxes  120 million  as well as the following decreases across our lodging business lower interest income  6 million  and higher interest expense  2 million  

2011 compared to 2010 

net income decreased by 260 million 57 percent to 198 million in 2011 from 458 million in 2010 and diluted earnings per share decreased by 066 per share 55 percent to 055 per share from 121 per share in 2010 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “revenues” the 260 million decrease in net income was due to timeshare strategyimpairment charges 324 million higher income taxes 65 million lower gains and other income 42 million lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 40 million and lower interest income 5 million higher base management and franchise fees 105 million higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 49 million lower general administrative and other expenses 28 million lower interest expense 16 million higher incentive management fees 13 million and lower equity in losses 5 million partially offset these items 

earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda a financial measure that is not prescribed or authorized by united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization we believe that ebitda is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business we also use ebitda as do analysts lenders investors and others to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings accordingly the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets these 

differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 

we also believe that adjusted ebitda another nongaap financial measure is a meaningful indicator of operating performance our adjusted ebitda reflects 

• timeshare spinoff adjustments for 2011 timeshare spinoff adjustments as if the spinoff occurred on the first day of 2011 the timeshare spinoff adjustments of 260 million reflected in net income for 2011 totaled 300 million pretax and are primarily comprised of the following pretax items 1 the addition of 217 million to remove the losses of our former timeshare segment 2 the addition of a 60 million payment by mvw to us of estimated license fees 3 the addition of 34 million to remove unallocated spinoff transaction costs 4 the addition of 10 million of estimated interest income 5 the subtraction of 14 million of estimated interest expense and 6 the subtraction of 7 million of other expenses not previously allocated to our former timeshare segment and 

•  adjustments for other charges for 2011 these adjustments of 17 million to net income for 2011 totaled 28 million pretax and consist of the following pretax items 1 an 18 million charge for an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable securities and 2 a 5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a 5 million accounts receivable reserve both for one luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy we discuss the otherthantemporary impairment of marketable securities in greater detail in the preceding gains losses and other income caption 

we believe that adjusted ebitda that excludes these items is also a meaningful measure of our operating performance because it permits periodoverperiod comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges ebitda and adjusted ebitda also facilitate our comparison of results from our ongoing operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies 

  

ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated under gaap both of these nongaap measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make in addition other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and in particular adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate them at all limiting ebitdas and adjusted ebitdas usefulness as comparative measures we provide adjusted ebitda for illustrative and informational purposes only and adjusted ebitda is not necessarily indicative of and we do not purport that it represents what our operating results would have been had the spinoff occurred on the first day of 2011 adjusted ebitda also does not reflect certain financial and operating benefits we expect to realize as a result of the 2011 timeshare spinoff 

we show our 2012 and 2011 ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations and reconcile those measures with net income in the following tables 

  



business segments 

we are a diversified lodging company with operations in four business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging and luxury lodging see footnote no 15 “business segments” to our financial statements for further information on our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment and other information about each segment including revenues net income loss equity in earnings losses of equity method investees assets and capital expenditures 

in addition to our four current segments on november 21 2011 we spun off our former timeshare operations and timeshare development business which had until that time been our timeshare segment as a new independent company mvw see footnote no 15 “business segments” to our financial statements for historical financial results of our former timeshare segment and footnote no 16 spinoff to our financial statements for more information on the spinoff also see the consolidated results caption earlier in this report for more information including tables on the impact of the spinoff

lodging  reflects all four of our lodging segments and our former timeshare segment for periods before the spinoff date 

2012 compared to 2011

lodging development 

we added 122  properties totaling 27059  rooms across our brands in 2012 and 42  properties  8883  rooms left the system not including residential products or execustay we also added three  residential properties  89  units and no residential properties left the system highlights of the year included 

 

we currently have nearly 130000  hotel rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 30000  to 35000  hotel rooms gross to our system in 2013 

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

general administrative and other expenses increased by 2 million and primarily reflected the accelerated amortization of 8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for the property for which we earned the 14 million termination fee and 2 million of miscellaneous cost increases partially offset by favorable variances from the following 2011 items a 5 million performance cure payment we made for one property a 2 million guarantee accrual for one property and the writeoff of contract acquisition costs totaling 2 million for two properties

the 16 million increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily due to 7 million of net stronger results driven by higher revpar and propertylevel margins 7 million of termination fees for two properties and a 3 million favorable variance from prior year losses for a leased property that we now operate under a management agreement 

the 5 million increase in general administrative and other expenses primarily reflected the following 2011 items a 5 million performance cure payment for one property a 2 million increase in the guarantee reserve for one property and a 2 million writeoff of contract acquisition costs for two properties the increase was partially offset by a favorable variance from a 4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge that we recorded in 2010 because we expected that a management agreement for one property would be terminated early in 2011 as a result of a change in property ownership

higher gains and other income reflected a 41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture see the gains losses and other income caption earlier in this report for more information on the sale of this equity interest 

higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected higher revpar due to increased demand some of which is attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations and to a lesser extent new unit growth and our recognition of 7 million of deferred base management fees in 2012 in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in the joint venture

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

our credit facility provides for 1750 billion  of aggregate effective borrowings the facility supports general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures and letters of credit the availability of the credit facility also supports our commercial paper program borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating the term of the facility expires on june 23 2016 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations remains adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

we issue commercial paper in the united states we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper to affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2012  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1321 billion  and reflected borrowing capacity of 1233 billion  under our credit facility and our cash balance of 88 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 1750 billion  of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting  501 million  of outstanding commercial paper 15 million  of outstanding credit facility borrowings and  1 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs through commercial paper borrowings and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

cash from operations 

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 05 to 10 at yearend 2012 and 05 to 10 at yearend 2011 we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to this 2012 annual report on form 10k are as follows 

  



 timeshare cash flows 

while our former timeshare segment historically generated positive operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varied based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we included timeshare reportable sales we financed in cash from operations when we collected cash payments we show the net operating activity from our former timeshare segment before the spinoff which did not include income from our former timeshare segment in the following table new timeshare segment mortgages totaled  214 million  in 2011 and  256 million  in 2010 and collections totaled  273 million  in 2011 which included collections on securitized notes of  187 million  and  347 million  in 2010 which included collections on securitized notes of  230 million  



for more information on our timeshare note securitizations including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes see footnote no 10 “asset securitizations” to our financial statements 

we expect that our 2011 spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business will result in our realization through 2014 of approximately 480 million of cash tax benefits relating to the value of the timeshare business we realized 152 million of cash tax benefits in 2012 and 76 million in 2011we expect to realize approximately   140 million in 2013 for more information on the spinoff please see footnote no 16 spinoff to our financial statements 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 437 million  in 2012 183 million  in 2011 and 307 million  in 2010 these included expenditures for the development and construction of new hotels acquisitions of hotel properties improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives these numbers do not reflect former timeshare segment development expenditures which we included in “cash from operations” before the spinoff as noted in that section capital expenditures in 2012 increased by 254 million  compared to 2011 capital expenditures primarily reflected acquisition of land and a building as well as renovations of buildings associated with plans to develop three edition hotels over time we anticipate selling these properties subject to our retaining longterm management agreements we also purchased land for an edition hotel which we anticipate will be developed by a third party 

contract acquisition costs in 2012 increased by 179 million  compared to 2011 primarily due to the 192 million acquisition of the gaylord hotel management company separately we classified the 18 million acquisition of the gaylord brand name in 2012 as other investing activities capital expenditures in 2011 decreased by 124 million  compared to 2010 primarily due to the purchase of two hotels in 2010 see footnote no 7 acquisitions and dispositions to our financial statements for more information on these acquisitions we expect 2013 investment spending will total approximately 600 million  to 800 million  including approximately 100 million  for maintenance capital spending investment spending also includes other capital expenditures including property acquisitions loan advances contract acquisition costs and equity and other investments 

over time we have sold lodging properties both completed and under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations we expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because 1 we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions  property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 65 million  in 2012 20 million in 2011 and 114 million in 2010 see footnote no 7 acquisitions and dispositions to our financial statements for more information on dispositions 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise loan collections and sales net of loan advances amounted to 138 million  in 2012 and 84 million in 2011 at yearend 2012  we had a 15 million longterm senior loan and 227 million of mezzanine and other loans 165 million longterm and 62 million shortterm outstanding compared with no senior loans and 382 million of mezzanine and other loans 298 million longterm and 84 million shortterm outstanding at yearend 2011 in 2012 our notes receivable balance for senior mezzanine and other loans decreased by 140 million  primarily reflecting collection of a 69 million note receivable for a recoverable guarantee that we previously funded and 77 million of collections on two mvw notes receivable issued to us in conjunction with the spinoff see the “senior mezzanine and other loans” caption in footnote no 1 summary of significant accounting policies 

equity and cost method investments  cash outflows of 15 million  in 2012 83 million  in 2011 and 29 million  in 2010 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures 

cash from financing activities 

debt  debt increased by 764 million  in 2012  to 2935 million  at yearend 2012  from 2171 million at yearend 2011 and reflected our 2012 issuance of 594 million book value of series k senior notes our 2012 issuance of 349 million book value of series l senior notes a 170 million  increase in commercial paper and 15 million of borrowings under our credit facility partially offset by the 348 million book value retirement at maturity of our series f senior notes and decreases of  16 million  in other debt which includes capital leases   see footnote no 11 longterm debt for additional information on the debt issuances debt decreased by 658 million in 2011 to 2171 million at yearend 2011 from 2829 million at yearend 2010 and reflected a 1016 million decrease in nonrecourse debt for previously securitized notes which we transferred to mvw as part of the spinoff partially offset by a 331 million increase in commercial paper and increases of 27 million in other debt which includes capital leases 

on february 15 2013 after yearend 2012 we made a 411 million  cash payment of principal and interest to retire at maturity all of our outstanding series j notes 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2012 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 39 percent and an average maturity of approximately 47 years the ratio of our fixedrate longterm debt to our total longterm debt was 08 to 10 at yearend 2012

brands licensed by us to mvw are as follows 

the marriott vacation club  brand is mvws signature offering in the upscale tier of the vacation ownership industry marriott vacation club resorts typically combine many of the comforts of home such as spacious accommodations with one two and three bedroom options living and dining areas inunit kitchens and laundry facilities with resort amenities such as large feature swimming pools restaurants and bars convenience stores fitness facilities and spas as well as sports and recreation facilities appropriate for each resorts unique location

at yearend 2011 mvw operated 64  properties primarily in the united states but also in other countries and territories 

other activities 

at yearend 2011 marriott golf managed 44 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners 

at yearend 2011 we operated 15 systemwide hotel reservation centers eight in the united states and canada and seven in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others 

at yearend 2011 we had six credit card programs in the united states canada and the united kingdom which include both marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards credit cards we earn licensing fees based on card usage and the cards are designed to encourage loyalty to our brands 

we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ®  best rate guarantee gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our website or any other marriott reservation channel also key to our success is our strong marriott rewards program our ritzcarlton rewards program and our informationrich and easytouse marriottcom website 

with 75 percent of our guests saying they use our website when planning or booking their stays and with nearly 7 billion in annual propertylevel gross revenues marriottcom is one of the largest online retail sites in the world based on sales in 2011 we introduced a number of new digital innovations including a new mobile booking experience we made improvements to the marriottcom booking search and online marriott rewards experience that are designed to generate more revenue further reduce booking costs and make it even easier for our customers to do business with us we are also a founding venture partner along with five other major hotel chains in the establishment of roomkeycom a new industry online referral and lead generation site roomkeycom will allow consumers to research hotel options across multiple brands and when a roomkeycom customer selects a marriott branded hotel the customer books directly on marriottcom as a result we expect roomkeycom will drive new business to marriottcom with a more costeffective and efficient business model for properties in our system than other online travel sites 

our sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around customer needs reducing duplication of sales efforts and enabling coverage for a larger number of accounts we consider our new organization   to be   a key competitive advantage for marriott the deployment rollout which began in late 2007 was completed in june 2011 our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective with over 3700 properties in our system economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and franchisees and enhance our fee revenue in 2011 we also implemented innovative technology solutions including our retail pricing optimizer tool rpo and our high performance pricing tool hpp rpo determines optimal transient retail benchmark rates for hotels using an analyticallydriven and marketbased methodology we believe this technology provides a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increases efficiency in analysis and decision making and produces increased property level revenue for transient retail and associated segments hpp enables hotels to more effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes using webbased functionality the streamlined process provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

as further discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” later in this report in conducting our business we utilize sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems and our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs we also make certain technologies available to our guests keeping pace with developments in technology is important for our operations and our competitive position furthermore the integrity and protection of customer employee and company data is critical to us as we use such data for business decisions and to maintain operational efficiency 

building on more than 20 years of energy conservation experience we are committed to protecting the environment our “spirit to preserve ® ” environmental strategy calls for greening our multibillion dollar supply chain further reducing fuel and water consumption expanding our portfolio of green hotels and buildings educating and inspiring employees and guests to support the environment and investing in innovative largescale conservation projects worldwide 

we were the first in the hospitality industry to launch a series of green hotel prototypes that have been preapproved by us green building council “usgbc” as part of its leadership in energy and environment design “leed” volume program meaning that any hotel that follows these plans will earn basic leed certification or possibly higher upon final 

usgbc approval while also reducing energy and water consumption up to 25 percent we are also developing a portfolio of newly designed green fairfield inn properties in brazil the us travel association confirms that travelers place the importance of supporting environmentally responsible travel service suppliers as a necessity even in an economic downturn 

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands that address different price and service points we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising there are approximately 900 lodging management companies in the united states including approximately 20 that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

during the recent recession we experienced significant reductions in demand for hotel rooms and timeshare products particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally improved in 2010 and 2011 additional cost reductions could become necessary to preserve operating margins if demand trends reverse but we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry and we believe that brand recognition is a method of competition in the industry in 2011 approximately 69 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is concentrated with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have approximately a ten percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a one percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

properties that we operate franchise or license are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties competitor hotels converting to one of marriott’s brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards are our frequent guest programs with over 38 million members and 13 participating brands in addition mvw and other program partners are able to participate in the marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs the rewards programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 35 participating airline programs we believe that our rewards programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2011 approximately 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by rewards program members we continue to enhance our rewards program offerings and specifically and strategically market to this large and growing customer base our loyal rewards member base 

provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts see the our rewards programs caption in footnote no 1 summary of significant accounting policies for additional information 

employee relations 

at yearend 2011 we had approximately 120000 employees approximately 7800 of whom were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation of properties and our development of properties comply in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations our compliance with such provisions also has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position nor do we anticipate that such compliance will have a material impact in the future

risk factors 

tableend 

forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in these forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

our industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties for customers  we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others if we cannot compete successfully in these areas this could limit our operating margins diminish our market share and reduce our earnings 

general economic uncertainty and weak demand in the lodging industry could continue to impact our financial results and growth  weak economic conditions in the united states europe and much of the rest of the world and the uncertainty over the duration of these conditions could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging industry as a result of current economic conditions we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms particularly in some markets recent improvements in demand trends globally may not continue and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery stalls or conditions worsen 

operational risks 

premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which the company fails or elects not to cure a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

our lodging operations are subject to global regional and national conditions  because we conduct our business on a global platform our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of both global and regional economies in recent years our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future economic performance could be similarly affected by the economic environment in each of the regions in which we operate the resulting unknown pace of business travel and the occurrence of any future incidents in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the united states also makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business  we currently operate or franchise hotels and resorts in 73  countries and our operations outside the united states represented approximately 16  percent of our revenues in 2011  we expect that the international share of our total revenues will increase in future years as a result we are increasingly exposed to a number of challenges and risks associated with doing business outside the united states including the following any of which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs result in significant liabilities or sanctions or otherwise disrupt our business 1 compliance with complex and changing 

laws regulations and policies of governments that may impact our operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with laws that affect the activities of companies abroad including us and other jurisdictions anticorruption laws currency regulations and laws affecting dealings with certain nations 3 limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax effective manner 4 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 5 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws 6 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest including in the middle east acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation and 7 currency exchange rate fluctuations 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful  we cannot assure that our recently launched edition autograph collection and ac hotels by marriott brands or any new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other customers we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing the brands or any new programs or products or that the brands or any new programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis and other natural disasters manmade disasters such as the recent oil spill in the gulf of mexico and more recently the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in japan and the spread of contagious diseases such as h1n1 flu avian flu and sars in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers could cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest or civil strife such as recent events in egypt libya and bahrain and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we can obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

disagreements with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or may delay implementation of product or service initiatives  consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product or service initiatives such disagreements may be more likely when hotel returns are weaker we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but are not always able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

our business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations   events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact the reputation of our brands if the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines our market share reputation business financial condition or results of operations could be affected 

actions by our franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our image and reputation   we franchise and license many of our brand names and trademarks to third parties in connection with lodging timeshare and residential services under the terms of their agreements with us our franchisees and licensees interact directly with customers and other third parties under our brand and trade names if these franchisees or licensees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards experience operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with ours our image and reputation could suffer although our franchise and license agreements provide us with recourse and remedies in the event of a breach by the franchisee or licensee including termination of the agreements under certain circumstances pursuing any such recourse remedy or termination could be expensive  and time consuming  in addition while we believe that our contractual termination rights are strong we cannot assure you that a court would ultimately enforce those rights in every instance 

damage to or losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance  we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes 

hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts or liabilities that result from breaches in the security of our information systems may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

development and financing risks 

while  w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties our hotel owners depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary  in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control instability in the financial markets and the difficulty of obtaining financing on attractive terms or at all continues to constrain the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks  we develop new hotel and residential properties and previously developed timeshare interval and fractional ownership properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the 2009 and 2011 impairment charges associated with our former timeshare business our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to further decreases in demand for residential increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for these projects that are not pursued to completion 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks  partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in the current difficult business environment 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties that are associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits  in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate through noncontrolling interests andor 

licensing fees in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including luxury residences and condominiums under our ritzcarlton and marriott brands such projects pose additional risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging businesses which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 

 technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position  the lodging industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis if we are unable to do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s look no further ®  best rate guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ®  and yahoo ®  to steer customers toward their websites a practice currently being challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from marriottcom or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels 

failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions operational inefficiencies damage of reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits  our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services including in areas such as human resources outsourcing website hosting and email marketing we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to us if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information the regulatory environment as well as the requirements imposed on us by the payment card industry surrounding information security and privacy is also increasingly demanding in both the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory and payment card industry requirements and employee and customer expectations or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so our information systems and records including those we maintain with our service providers may be subject to security breaches system failures viruses operator error or inadvertent releases of data a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data maintained by us or by a service provider could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines or litigation a breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits 

early in 2011 we were notified by epsilon a marketing vendor used by the company to manage customer emails that an unauthorized third party gained access to a number of epsilon’s accounts including the company’s email list epsilon has stated that the unauthorized persons had access only to names and email addresses of the company’s customers and did not have access to other customer information such as physical addresses loyalty program point balances account logins and 

passwords credit card information or other personal data we have informed our affected customers of the breach and that it may result in receiving unsolicited emails 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively  we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including email marketing online advertising and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email online advertising and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of certain products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

other risks 

changes in tax and other laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs  our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world in response to the recent economic crisis and the recent recession we anticipate that many of the jurisdictions in which we do business continue to review tax and other revenue raising laws regulations and policies and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our nonus operations or that could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured for example most us company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the united states is generally taxed at local rates which are often much lower than us tax rates if changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations significantly increase the tax rates on nonus income our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced if such increases resulted from our status as a us company those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our nonus competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates 

the spinoff could result in significant tax liability to us and our shareholders  although we received a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion from our tax counsel confirming that the distribution of marriott vacations worldwide corporation mvw common stock will not result in the recognition for us federal income tax purposes of income gain or loss to us or our shareholders except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares of mvw common stock the private letter ruling and opinion that we received are subject to the continuing validity of any assumptions and representations reflected therein in addition an opinion from our tax counsel is not binding on the irs or a court moreover certain future events that may or may not be within our control including certain extraordinary purchases of our stock or mvws stock could cause the distribution not to qualify as taxfree accordingly the irs could determine that the distribution of the mvw common stock is a taxable transaction and a court could agree with the irs if the distribution of the mvw common stock is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders who received shares of mvw common stock in the spinoff could incur significant tax liabilities under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that we entered into with mvw we are entitled to indemnification from mvw for certain taxes and related losses resulting from the failure of the distribution of mvw common stock to qualify as taxfree as a result of i any breach by mvw or its subsidiaries of the covenants regarding the preservation of the taxfree status of the distribution ii certain acquisitions of equity securities or assets of mvw or its subsidiaries and iii any breach by mvw or its subsidiaries of certain representations in the documents submitted to the irs and the separation documents relating to the spinoff if however the distribution fails to qualify as a taxfree transaction for reasons other than those specified in the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement liability for any resulting taxes related to the distribution will be apportioned between us and mvw based on our relative fair market values 

the spinoff might not produce the cash tax benefits we anticipate  in connection with the spinoff we completed an internal reorganization which included transactions that have been structured in a manner that are expected to result for us federal income tax purposes in our recognition of builtin losses in properties used in the north american and luxury segments of the timeshare division the recognition of these builtin losses and corresponding tax deductions are expected to generate significant cash tax benefits for us although we received a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion from our tax counsel confirming that these builtin losses will be recognized and deducted by us the private letter ruling and opinion that we received are subject to the continuing validity of any assumptions and representations reflected therein accordingly the irs could determine that the builtin losses should not be recognized or deductions for such losses should be disallowed and a court could agree with the irs if we are unable to deduct these losses for us federal income tax purposes and instead the tax basis of the properties that is attributable to the builtin losses is available to mvw and its subsidiaries mvw has agreed 

pursuant to the tax sharing and indemnification agreement to indemnify us for certain tax benefits that we otherwise would have recognized if we were able to deduct such losses for additional information on the cash tax benefits anticipated see the liquidity and capital resources caption within part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer  we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we cannot recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes in connection with mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder’s rights plan

business and overview 

under numerous brand names in 73  countries and territories we are a worldwide operator franchisor and licensor of hotels corporate housing properties and timeshare properties we also develop operate and market residential properties and provide services to homecondominium owner associations at yearend 2011 our system was comprised of 3718  properties  643196  rooms the figures in the preceding sentence include 32  home and condominium products  3838  units for which we manage the related owners’ associations in addition we provided 2166  furnished corporate housing rental units which are not included in the totals at yearend 2011 our operations are grouped into four business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging and luxury lodging 

on november 21 2011 the spinoff date we completed a spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special taxfree dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary marriott vacations worldwide corporation mvw in connection with the spinoff we entered into several agreements with mvw and in some cases certain of its subsidiaries that govern our postspinoff relationship with mvw including a separation and distribution agreement and two license agreements for the use of marriott and ritzcarlton marks and intellectual property under license agreements with us mvw is both the exclusive developer and operator of timeshare fractional and related products under the marriott brand and the exclusive developer of fractional and related products under the ritzcarlton brand we receive license fees under these license agreements 

because of our significant continuing involvement in mvw future operations by virtue of the license and other agreements between us and mvw our former timeshare segments historical financial results prior to the spinoff date will continue to be included in our historical financial results as a component of continuing operations please see footnote no 17 “spinoff” of the notes to our financial statements and “part i item 1a – risk factors other risks” for additional information 

we earn base incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease we also earn fees from credit card endorsements the sale of branded residential real estate and licensing the marriott timeshare and fractional and ritzcarlton fractional brands to mvw prior to the spinoff of our timeshare business we also generated revenues from the following sources 1 selling timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties 2 operating the resorts and residential properties 3 financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals and 4 rentals all of which we included in our timeshare segment 

we sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a standalone basis under the ritzcarlton brand the ritzcarlton residences residences are typically constructed and sold by thirdparty developers with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk while the worldwide residential market is very large the luxurious nature of our residential properties the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands and the hospitality services that we provide all serve to make our residential properties distinctive 

lodging 

conditions for our lodging business improved in 2011 reflecting generally low supply growth a more favorable economic climate in most developed markets around the world albeit at a generally low growth rate and stronger economic growth in emerging markets strong unit growth and the impact of operating efficiencies across our company while economic growth in europe slowed in the later part of 2011 and the level of economic growth is uncertain in the united states we remain focused on doing the things that we do well that is selling rooms taking care of our guests and making sure we control our costs in 2011 as compared to 2010 worldwide average daily rates increased 34  percent on a constant dollar basis to 13326  for comparable systemwide properties with revpar increasing 64  percent to 9269  and occupancy increasing 20  percentage points to 696  percent 

for properties in north america in 2011 markets in the west reflected strong demand while properties in the east and south reflected more moderate demand in washington dc a shorter congressional calendar and government spending concerns reduced lodging demand for properties in china and brazil demand was particularly strong during 2011 while for properties in europe demand was more moderate reflecting the financial crisis and related economic concerns demand at properties in the middle east remained weak reflecting continued unrest in that region and demand outside of the more metropolitan regions in britain remained weak as a result of government austerity measures while demand in japan was weak in the first quarter of 2011 reflecting the impact of the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami domestic demand began to 

improve in the 2011 second quarter and continued throughout the rest of 2011 but remained below 2010 levels 

we monitor market conditions continuously and carefully price our rooms daily to meet individual hotel demand levels we modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes demand for higher rated rooms improved in 2010 and that improvement continued in 2011 which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business this mix improvement benefited average daily rates 

the hotels in our system serve both transient and group customers overall business transient and leisure transient demand was strong in 2011 while group demand continues to improve group customers typically book rooms and meeting space with significant lead times sometimes several years in advance of guest arrival typically twothirds of group business is booked prior to the year of arrival and onethird is booked in the year of arrival during an economic recovery group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings group business booked in earlier periods at lower rates continues to roll off and with improving group demand is being replaced with bookings reflecting generally higher rates 

negotiated corporate business “special corporate business” represented 14 percent of our fullservice hotel room nights for 2011 in north america we typically negotiate and fix room rates associated with special corporate business in advance of the year to which they apply which limits our ability to raise these rates quickly for 2012 we expect to complete negotiations with our special corporate business clients in the first quarter and we expect rates to be higher than the prior year in negotiating pricing for this segment of business we do not focus strictly on volume but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our customers including for example stay patterns day of week and season locations of stays nonroom spend and aggregate spend 

properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls where appropriate for market conditions we have maintained many of our 2009 propertylevel cost saving initiatives regarding menus and restaurant hours room amenities crosstraining personnel and utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible we also control aboveproperty costs which we allocate to hotels by remaining focused on systems processing and support areas in addition we continue to require where legally permitted or encourage employees to use their vacation time accrued during the year 

our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction the worldwide presence and quality of our brands our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards loyalty programs a multichannel central reservations system and desirable property amenities we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we also remove hotels from our system that no longer meet our standards we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary informationrich and easytouse website marriottcom through functionality and service improvements and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of propertylevel reservations via this costefficient channel 

we completed the roll out of our sales deployment strategy in 2011 which aligns our sales efforts around customer needs reducing duplication of sales efforts and enabling coverage for a larger number of accounts we now have the systems training and incentives for sales associates to sell our represented hotels as a portfolio rather than solely on a hotelbyhotel basis our largest properties continue to have sales staff assigned on property in 2011 we also implemented innovative technology solutions including our retail pricing optimizer tool rpo and our high performance pricing tool hpp rpo determines optimal transient retail benchmark rates for hotels using an analyticallydriven and marketbased methodology we believe this technology provides a competitive advantage in pricing decisions increases efficiency in analysis and decision making and produces increased property level revenue for transient retail and associated segments hpp enables hotels to more effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes using webbased functionality the streamlined process provides for greater pricing flexibility reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance and increases the speed to market of new products and services 

our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels rather than owning them at yearend 2011 we operated 44  percent of the hotel rooms in our worldwide system under management agreements our franchisees operated 53  percent under franchise agreements we owned or leased 2  percent and 1  percent were operated or franchised through unconsolidated joint ventures our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while the addition of new hotels to our system generates growth typically with little or no investment by the company this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we believe we increase our financial flexibility by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we make 

we consider revpar which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in 

room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues references to revpar throughout this report are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted constant dollar statistics are calculated by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period 

companyoperated house profit margin is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit also known as house profit to total propertylevel revenue we consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

timeshare 

as noted previously on november 21 2011 we completed a spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special taxfree dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary mvw 

in preparing our former timeshare segment to operate as an independent publicly traded company following the spinoff of the stock of mvw management assessed the timeshare segments intended use of excess undeveloped land and built inventory and the current market conditions for those assets on september 8 2011 management approved a plan for our former timeshare segment to accelerate cash flow through the monetization of certain excess undeveloped land and excess built luxury inventory as a result we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 324 million   234 million  aftertax in our 2011 income statement under the timeshare strategyimpairment charges caption we discuss these charges in more detail under the caption timeshare strategyimpairment charges later in this managements discussion and analysis section also see the timeshare caption later in this managements discussion and analysis section for additional information on the results of operations 

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2011  2010  and 2009  the results for 2011 include the results of the former timeshare segment prior to the spinoff date while 2010 and 2009 included the former timeshare segment for the entire fiscal year see the timeshare segment discussion later in this report for additional information 

revenues 

2011 compared to 2010 

revenues increased by 626 million   5 percent  to 12317 million  in 2011  from 11691 million  in 2010  as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue  604 million  base management and franchise fees  105 million  owned leased corporate housing and other revenue  37 million  and incentive management fees  13 million  all from properties outside of north america these favorable variances were partially offset by lower timeshare sales and services revenue  133 million  

the increases in base management fees to 602 million  in 2011  from 562 million  in 2010  and in franchise fees to 506 million  in 2011  from 441 million  in 2010  primarily reflected stronger revpar and to a lesser extent the impact of unit growth across the system and favorable foreign exchange rates base management fees in 2011 included 51 million associated with the timeshare business compared to 55 million in the prior year franchise fees in 2011 included 4 million associated with mvw license fees the increase in incentive management fees from 182 million  in 2010 to 195 million  in 2011 primarily reflected higher net propertylevel income resulting from higher propertylevel revenue and continued propertylevel cost controls and to a lesser extent new unit growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange rates 

the increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue to 1083 million  in 2011  from 1046 million  in 2010  reflected 21 million of higher total branding fees 7 million of higher corporate housing revenue 4 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees and 3 million of higher other revenue combined branding fees associated with credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled 99 million  and 78 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively 

the decrease in timeshare sales and services revenue to 1088 million  in 2011  from 1221 million  in 2010  primarily 

reflected 1 49 million  of lower development revenue which reflected the spinoff and to a lesser extent lower sales volumes partially offset by   favorable reportability primarily related to sales reserves recorded in 2010  2 45 million  of lower financing revenue from lower interest income as a result of the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to mvw in conjunction with the spinoff as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance prior to the spinoff date 3 32 million  of lower other revenue which primarily reflected the spinoff and lower resales revenue and 4 7 million  of lower services revenue which reflected the spinoff partially offset by   increased rental occupancies and rates prior to the spinoff date see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our former timeshare segment 

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income the increase in cost reimbursements revenue to 8843 million  in 2011  from 8239 million  in 2010  reflected the impact of higher propertylevel demand and growth across the system 

2010 compared to 2009 

revenues increased by 783 million 7 percent to 11691 million in 2010 from 10908 million in 2009 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue 557 million timeshare sales and services revenue 98 million base management and franchise fees 73 million incentive management fees 28 million comprised of a 12 million increase for north america and a 16 million increase outside of north america and owned leased corporate housing and other revenue 27 million 

the increase in timeshare sales and services revenue to 1221 million in 2010 from 1123 million in 2009 primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income and to a lesser extent higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancy levels and rates these favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily associated with tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009 a 20 million increase in reserves we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default and lower sales to new customers in our initial launch of the mvcd program see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our timeshare segment 

the increases in base management fees to 562 million in 2010 from 530 million in 2009 and in franchise fees to 441 million in 2010 from 400 million in 2009 primarily reflected stronger revpar and the impact of unit growth across the system the increase in incentive management fees to 182 million in 2010 from 154 million in 2009 primarily reflected higher propertylevel revenue and continued tight propertylevel cost controls that improved 2010 margins compared to 2009 and to a lesser extent new unit growth 

the increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue to 1046 million in 2010 from 1019 million in 2009 largely reflected 14 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees associated with six properties that exited our system 8 million of higher branding fees 6 million of higher revenue for owned and leased properties and 5 million of higher other revenue partially offsetting these favorable variances was a onetime 6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009 the increase in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected increased revpar and occupancy levels combined branding fees associated with credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled 78 million and 70 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the increase in cost reimbursements revenue to 8239 million in 2010 from 7682 million in 2009 reflected the impact of growth across the system partially offset by lower propertylevel costs in response to cost controls net of hotels exiting the system we added 4287 managed rooms and 17024 franchised rooms to our system in 2010 

timeshare strategyimpairment charges 

 2011 charges 

in preparing our former timeshare segment to operate as an independent publicly traded company following our spinoff of the stock of mvw see footnote no 17 spinoff for additional information management assessed the timeshare segments intended use of excess undeveloped land and built inventory and the current market conditions for those assets on september 8 2011 management approved a plan for the timeshare segment to accelerate cash flow through the monetization of certain excess undeveloped land in the us mexico and the bahamas over the next 18  to 24  months and to accelerate sales of excess built luxury fractional and residential inventory over the next three  years as a result in accordance with the guidance for accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets because the nominal cash flows from the planned land sales and the estimated fair values of the land and excess built luxury inventory were less than their respective carrying values we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 324 million   234  million aftertax in our 2011 income 

statement under the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” caption 

2009 charges 

in 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling 752 million in our income statement 502 million aftertax including 614 million of pretax charges that impacted operating income under the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” caption and 138 million of pretax charges that impacted nonoperating income under the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges nonoperating” caption the 752 million of pretax impairment charges were noncash other than 27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and 21 million of charges for purchase commitments 

for additional information related to the 2009 and 2011 impairment charges including how these impairments were determined the impairment charges grouped by product type andor geographic location and a table showing the composition of the charges see footnote no 18 “timeshare strategy  impairment charges” 

restructuring costs and other charges 

as part of the restructuring actions we began in 2008 we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our former timeshare segment hotel development aboveproperty level management and corporate overhead these further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of 51 million in 2009 for additional information on the 2009 restructuring costs including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment please see footnote no 21 “restructuring costs and other charges” of the notes to the financial statements in our 2009 form 10k for the cumulative restructuring costs incurred since inception please see footnote no 19 “restructuring costs and other charges” of the notes to our financial statements in this form 10k 

as a result of our restructuring efforts we realized the following annual cost savings in 2010 and 2009 respectively which were primarily reflected in our income statement under the expense captions noted i 113 million 73 million aftertax and 80 million to 85 million 48 million to 52 million aftertax for our former timeshare segment under “timesharedirect” and “general administrative and other” ii 12 million 8 million aftertax and 9 million 5 million aftertax for hotel development across several of our lodging segments primarily under “general administrative and other” and iii 10 million 8 million aftertax and 8 million 5 million aftertax for reducing above propertylevel lodging management personnel under “general administrative and other” 

operating income loss 

2011 compared to 2010 

operating income decreased by 169 million  to 526 million  in 2011  from 695 million  in 2010  the decrease reflected timeshare strategyimpairment charges of 324 million  recorded in 2011 and 40 million  of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by a 105 million  increase in base management and franchise fees 49 million  of higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses a 28 million  decrease in general administrative and other expenses and 13 million  of higher incentive management fees we address the reasons for the increases in base management and franchise fees and in incentive management fees as compared to 2010  in the preceding “revenues” section 

the 49 million   54 percent  increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to 21 million of higher branding fees 15 million of net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher revpar and propertylevel margins 6 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees net of 2010 termination costs 6 million of higher corporate housing and other revenue net of expenses and 5 million of decreased rent expense partially offset by 4 million of lower results at a leased hotel in japan that experienced lower demand as a result of the earthquake and tsunami earlier in the year 

general administrative and other expenses decreased by 28 million   4 percent  to 752 million  in 2011  from 780 million  in 2010  the decrease primarily reflected favorable variances from the following items recorded in 2010 an 84 million longlived asset impairment charge associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset which we did not allocate to any of our segments a 13 million longlived asset impairment charge allocated to our former timeshare segment and a 14 million longlived asset impairment charge allocated to our north american limitedservice segment also contributing to the decrease in expenses was 9 million of lower former timeshare segment expenses due to the spinoff and a 5 million reversal in 2011 of a loan loss provision related to one property with increased expected future cash flows these favorable variances were partially offset by the following items recorded in 2011 34 million of transactionrelated expenses associated with the spinoff of the timeshare business 17 million of higher compensation costs 10 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets and initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally a 5 million impairment of contract acquisition costs and a 5 million accounts receivable reserve both related 

to one luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy a 5 million performance cure payment for a north american fullservice property and 7 million related to an increase in the guarantee reserves for one international and one north american fullservice property primarily due to cash flow shortfalls at the properties and a 2 million writeoff of contract acquisition costs associated with two other properties unfavorable variances from a 4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the united states and a 6 million reversal of guarantee accruals primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements both recorded in 2010 further offset the aforementioned favorable variances 

the 28 million  decrease in total general administrative and other expenses consisted of a 34 million  decrease that we did not allocate to any of our segments a 22 million  decrease allocated to our former timeshare segment and a 12 million  decrease allocated to our north american limitedservice segment partially offset by a 20 million  increase allocated to our luxury segment a 15 million  increase allocated to our international segment and a 5 million  increase allocated to our north american fullservice segment 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses totaled 159 million  in 2011  and 199 million  in 2010  the decrease of 40 million  as compared to 2010  primarily reflected 28 million  of lower other revenue net of expenses and 25 million  of lower financing revenue net of expenses partially offset by 8 million  of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 5 million  of higher services revenue net of expenses the 28 million  decrease in other revenue net of expenses primarily reflected a 15 million unfavorable variance from an adjustment to the marriott rewards liability in the prior year and to a lesser extent in the current year reflected the impact of the spinoff as well as lower resales revenue net of expenses due to lower closings the 25 million  decrease in financing revenue net of expenses primarily reflected decreased interest income due to the spinoff as well as lower notes receivable balances prior to the spinoff date higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected favorable reportability as well as a favorable variance from a net 12 million  reserve in the prior year partially offset by lower 2011 sales volumes as well as the impact of the spinoff see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our former timeshare segment prior to spinoff 

2010 compared to 2009 

operating income increased by 847 million to operating income of 695 million in 2010 from an operating loss of 152 million in 2009 the increase in operating income reflected a favorable variance of 614 million related to timeshare strategyimpairment charges recorded in 2009 116 million of higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses a 73 million increase in base management and franchise fees a 51 million decrease in restructuring costs 28 million of higher incentive management fees and 23 million of higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by a 58 million increase in general administrative and other expenses we note the reasons for the increase of 73 million in base management and franchise fees as well as the increase of 28 million in incentive management fees as compared to 2009 in the preceding “revenues” section 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2010 totaled 199 million the increase of 116 million as compared to 2009 primarily reflected 78 million of higher financing revenue net of expenses which largely reflected increased interest income associated with the impact of consolidating previously unconsolidated securitized notes under the new transfers of financial assets and consolidation standards 33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 8 million of higher other revenue net of expenses partially offset by 3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower product costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010 as well as favorable variances from both a 10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net 3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009 partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated in the preceding “revenues” section see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our former timeshare segment prior to spinoff 

the 23 million 34 percent increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to 12 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees net of property closing costs 8 million of higher branding fees a 4 million reversal of a liability related to a hotel that closed in 2010 and net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher revpar and propertylevel margins partially offset by additional rent expense associated with one property and an unfavorable variance from a onetime 6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 58 million 8 percent to 780 million in 2010 from 722 million in 2009 the increase primarily reflected the following 2010 charges an 84 million longlived asset impairment charge associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset which we did not allocate to any of our segments a 

13 million longlived asset impairment charge allocated to our former timeshare segment and a 14 million longlived asset impairment charge allocated to our north american limitedservice segment see footnote no 7 “property and equipment” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information on these three impairment charges in addition we recorded a 4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge allocated to our north american fullservice segment in 2010 see the north american fullservice segment discussion for additional information on this impairment charge also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was 35 million of higher compensation costs 14 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with initiatives to enhance our brands globally 7 million of increased currency exchange losses and 2 million of increased legal expenses these unfavorable variances were partially offset by an 8 million reversal in 2010 of guarantee accruals primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements and a 4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the united states in addition the comparison reflects the following 2009 expenses that we did not incur in 2010 49 million of impairment charges related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due in part to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls partially offset by an 11 million reversal of the 2008 accrual for the funding of those cash flow shortfalls a 7 million writeoff of timeshare segment capitalized software costs and 4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance the yearoveryear comparison also reflected a 15 million favorable variance in deferred compensation expenses with changes to our deferred compensation plan general administrative and other expenses for 2010 had no deferred compensation impact compared with 15 million of marktomarket valuation expenses in 2009 the increase in general administrative and other expenses was also partially offset by the elimination of the loan loss provision in 2010 compared with a 43 million provision in 2009 which reflected 29 million associated with one luxury segment project and 14 million associated with a north american limitedservice segment portfolio 

the 58 million increase in total general administrative and other expenses was comprised of a 77 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments a 5 million increase allocated to our former timeshare segment an 8 million decrease allocated to our north american limitedservice segment an 8 million decrease allocated to our luxury segment a 7 million decrease allocated to our north american fullservice segment and a 1 million decrease allocated to our international segment 

losses gains and other income expense 

we show our losses gains and other income for 2011 2010 and 2009 in the following table   



2011 compared to 2010 

the 23 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from an 18 million gain on the sale of one timeshare segment property in 2010 the 18 million  impairment of equity securities in 2011 reflects an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable securities for additional information on the impairment see footnote no 4 “fair value of financial instruments” 

2010 compared to 2009 

we did not extinguish any debt in 2010 in 2009 we repurchased 122 million principal amount of our senior notes in the open market across multiple series the 21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the 98 million purchase price and the 119 million net carrying amount of senior notes we repurchased during the period the 5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities for additional information on the impairment see footnote no 5 “fair value measurements” of the notes to the financial statements in our 2009 form 10k 

interest expense 

2011 compared to 2010 

interest expense decreased by 16 million   9 percent  to 164 million  in 2011  compared to 180 million  in 2010  this decrease was primarily driven by 1 a 12 million decrease in interest expense on securitized notes which reflected the transfer of these notes to mvw on the spinoff date as well as a lower average outstanding balance and a lower average interest rate on those notes prior to the spinoff date 2 a 2 million increase in capitalized interest associated with construction projects and 3 a 1 million decrease in interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program which reflected lower interest rates see the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report for additional information on our credit facility 

2010 compared to 2009 

interest expense increased by 62 million 53 percent to 180 million in 2010 compared to 118 million in 2009 this increase was driven by 1 the consolidation of 1121 million of debt in the 2010 first quarter associated with previously securitized notes which resulted in a 55 million increase in interest expense in 2010 related to that debt 2 a 14 million unfavorable variance from 2009 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2010 associated with construction projects and 3 12 million of higher interest expense in 2010 associated with our executive deferred compensation plan these increases were partially offset by 1 12 million of lower interest expense associated with our repurchase of 122 million of principal amount of our senior notes in 2009 the maturity of our series c senior notes in the 2009 fourth quarter and other net debt reductions and 2 a 7 million decrease in interest expense associated with our previous 24 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility which primarily reflected lower average borrowings 

interest income and income tax 

2011 compared to 2010 

interest income decreased by 5 million   26 percent  to 14 million  in 2011  compared to 19 million  in 2010  primarily reflecting a 3 million decrease associated with the repayment of certain loans 

our tax provision increased by 65 million   70 percent  to a tax provision of 158 million  in 2011  from a tax provision of 93 million  in 2010  the increase was primarily due to an unfavorable variance related to a prior year irs settlement on the treatment of funds received from certain nonus subsidiaries that resulted in an 85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010 and 34 million  of income tax expense that we recorded in 2011 to writeoff certain deferred tax assets that we transferred to mvw in conjunction with the spinoff of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business we impaired these assets because we consider it more likely than not that mvw will be unable to realize the value of those deferred tax assets please see footnote no 17 spinoff of the notes to our financial statements for additional information on the transaction the increases were partially offset by lower pretax income in 2011 

2010 compared to 2009 

interest income decreased by 6 million 24 percent to 19 million in 2010 compared to 25 million in 2009 primarily reflecting a 4 million decrease associated with a loan that we determined was impaired in 2009 because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis we did not recognize any interest on this loan after its impairment the decline in interest income also reflected a 2 million decrease due to a reduction in principal due associated with one loan 

our income tax expense increased by 158 million 243 percent to a provision of 93 million in 2010 from a benefit of 65 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to pretax income in 2010 as compared to a pretax loss in 2009 and 14 million of higher tax expense associated with changes to our deferred compensation plan there were no 2010 plan changes impacting deferred compensation expenses compared with changes which had a 14 million favorable impact in 2009 the increase was partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2010 as 2009 reflected 52 million of income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain nonus subsidiaries in the 2010 fourth quarter we settled issues with the internal revenue service “irs” on our treatment of funds received from certain nonus subsidiaries in conjunction with that settlement we recorded an 85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010 our 2010 income tax expense also reflected a 12 million benefit we recorded primarily associated with revisions to prior years’ estimated foreign tax expense 

equity in losses earnings 

2011 compared to 2010 

equity in losses of 13 million  in 2011  decreased by 5 million  from equity in losses of 18 million  in 2010  and 

primarily reflected 9 million of increased earnings at two north american limitedservice joint ventures and one international segment joint venture primarily due to stronger propertylevel performance 8 million of lower losses for a residential and fractional project joint venture our former timeshare segment stopped recognizing their share of the joint venture’s losses as their investment including loans due from the joint venture was reduced to zero in 2010 and a favorable variance from joint venture impairment charges in 2010  of 5 million  associated with our north american limitedservice segment these favorable impacts were partially offset by 8 million of decreased earnings at two luxury segment joint ventures furthermore in 2011 and 2010 we reversed 3 million and 11 million respectively of the 27 million funding liability we initially recorded in the timeshare strategyimpairment charges nonoperating caption of our 2009 income statement see footnote no 18 timeshare strategyimpairment charges of the notes to our financial statements of this 10k for additional information the 11 million reversal in 2010 and the 3 million reversal in 2011 were both recorded based on facts and circumstances surrounding a project related to our former timeshare segment including continued progress on certain constructionrelated legal claims and potential funding of certain costs by one of the partners 

2010 compared to 2009 

equity in losses of 18 million in 2010 decreased by 48 million from equity in losses of 66 million in 2009 and primarily reflected favorable variances from a 30 million impairment charge associated with a luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined was fully impaired and a 3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that we did not allocate to one of our segments both incurred in 2009 in the 2010 fourth quarter we also recorded an 11 million reversal of the 27 million funding liability initially recorded in 2009 see preceding  2011 compared to 2010  discussion increased earnings of 5 million for our international segment joint ventures and 3 million of lower cancellation reserves at our former timeshare segment joint venture also contributed to the decrease in equity in losses a 2010 impairment charge of 5 million associated with our north american limitedservice segment joint venture partially offset the favorable impacts 

net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 

2010 compared to 2009 

net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 7 million in 2010 to zero compared to 7 million in 2009 the benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of 7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling 11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of 4 million associated with the losses 

net income loss 

2011 compared to 2010 

net income and net income attributable to marriott decreased by 260 million   57 percent  to 198 million  in 2011  from 458 million  in 2010  and diluted earnings per share attributable to marriott decreased by 066  per share  55 percent  to 055  per share from 121  per share in 2010  as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “operating income loss” the 260 million  decrease in net income compared to the prior year was due to timeshare strategyimpairment charges  324 million  higher income taxes  65 million  lower gains and other income  42 million  lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses  40 million  and lower interest income  5 million  higher base management and franchise fees  105 million  higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses  49 million  lower general administrative and other expenses  28 million  lower interest expense  16 million  higher incentive management fees  13 million  and lower equity in losses  5 million  partially offset these items 

2010 compared to 2009 

net income of 458 million in 2010 increased by 811 million 230 percent from a loss of 353 million in 2009 net income attributable to marriott of 458 million in 2010 increased by 804 million 232 percent from a loss of 346 million in 2009 and diluted income per share attributable to marriott of 121 per share increased by 218 225 percent from losses of 097 per share in 2009 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “operating income loss” the 458 million increase in net income compared to the prior year was due to a favorable variance related to timeshare strategyimpairment charges in 2009 752 million higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 116 million lower restructuring costs 51 million higher base management and franchise fees 73 million lower equity in losses 48 million higher incentive management fees 28 million higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 23 million and higher gains and other income 4 million these favorable variances were partially offset by higher income taxes 158 million higher general administrative and other expenses 58 million higher interest expense 62 million and lower interest income 6 million 

earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda a financial measure that is not prescribed or authorized by united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization we consider ebitda to be an indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business we also use ebitda as do analysts lenders investors and others to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings accordingly the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 

we also evaluate adjusted ebitda another nongaap financial measure as an indicator of operating performance our adjusted ebitda reflects 

1 timeshare spinoff adjustments timeshare spinoff adjustments as if the spinoff had occurred on the first day of 2010 the timeshare spinoff adjustments remove the results of our former timeshare segment for 2011 and 2010 remove unallocated spinoff transaction costs of 34 million we incurred in 2011 and assume payment by mvw to us of estimated license fees of 60 million for 2011 and 64 million for 2010 we have also included certain corporate items not previously allocated to our former timeshare segment in the timeshare spinoff adjustments for additional information on the nature of the timeshare spinoff adjustments see the form 8k we filed with the sec on november 21 2011 upon completion of the spinoff 

2 an adjustment for 28 million of other charges for 2011 consisting of an 18 million charge for an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable securities a 5 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs and a 5 million accounts receivable reserve both related to one luxury segment property whose owner filed for bankruptcy and 

3 an adjustment for 98 million of other charges for 2010 consisting of an 84 million impairment charge related to a capitalized revenue management software asset and a 14 million impairment charge related to a land parcel 

we discuss the second and third of these items in greater detail in the preceding losses gains and other income expense caption and the  2010 compared to 2009  heading under the operating income loss caption respectively 

we evaluate adjusted ebitda to make periodoverperiod comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges ebitda and adjusted ebitda also facilitate our comparison of results from our ongoing operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies 

  

ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap both of these nongaap measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make in addition other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate them at all limiting ebitdas and adjusted ebitdas usefulness as comparative measures we provide adjusted ebitda for illustrative and informational purposes only and this measure is not necessarily indicative of and does not purport to represent what our operating results would have been had the spinoff occurred on the first day of 2010 this information also does not reflect certain financial and operating benefits we expect to realize as a result of the spinoff 

we show our 2011 and 2010 ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations and reconcile those measures with net income in the following tables 

  



business segments 

we are a diversified hospitality company with operations in four business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging and luxury lodging see footnote no 16 “business segments” of the notes to our financial statements for further information on our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment the reclassification of certain 2010 and 2009 segment revenues segment financial results and segment assets to reflect our movement of hawaii to our north american segments from our international segment and other information about each segment including revenues net income loss attributable to marriott net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests equity in earnings losses of equity method investees assets and capital expenditures 

in addition to the segments noted previously on november 21 2011 we spun off our timeshare operations and timeshare development business as a new independent company mvw which was formerly our timeshare segment see footnote no 16 “business segments” of the notes to our financial statements for historical financial results of our former timeshare segment and footnote no 17 spinoff of the notes to our financial statements for additional information on the spinoff 

at yearend 2011  we operated franchised and licensed the following properties excluding 2166  corporate housing rental units associated with our execustay brand 



  

 

lodging  reflects all four of our lodging segments and our former timeshare segment for periods prior to the spinoff date 

2011 compared to 2010 

we added 206  properties  30856  rooms and 30  properties  6262  rooms exited our system in 2011 these figures do not include residential or execustay units during that time we also added four  residential properties  753  units and no  residential properties exited the system these property additions include 80  hotels  8371  rooms which are operated or franchised as part of our unconsolidated joint venture with ac hoteles sa see footnote no 8   “acquisitions and dispositions” for additional information about ac hotels by marriott 

total segment financial results decreased by 218 million   22  percent to 765 million  in 2011 from 983 million  in 2010 and total segment revenues increased by 586 million  to 12197 million  in 2011 a 5  percent increase from revenues of 11611 million  in 2010 

the yearoveryear increase in revenues included a 604 million  increase in cost reimbursements revenue which does not impact operating income or net income total segment financial results compared to 2010 primarily reflected 324 million  of timeshare strategyimpairment charges a decrease of 40 million  in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses a 24 million  decrease in gains and other income and a 6 million  increase in general administrative and other expenses partially offsetting these unfavorable factors were a 101 million  increase in base management and franchise fees to 1104 million  in 2011 from 1003 million  in 2010 an increase of 37 million  in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 13 million  of higher incentive management fees to 195 million  in 2011  from 182 million  in 2010  13 million  of lower joint venture equity losses and a 12 million  decrease in interest expense for more detailed information on the variances see the preceding sections beginning with “operating income loss” 

the 101 million  increase in base management and franchise fees primarily reflected stronger revpar and the impact of unit growth across the system and favorable foreign exchange rates in 2011  29  percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 27 percent in 2010 in addition in 2011  67  percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the united states versus 65 percent in 2010 

see “statistics” below for detailed information on systemwide revpar and companyoperated revpar by segment region and brand 

compared to 2010  worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins in 2011  increased by 60  basis points and worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit per available room hppar increased by 76  percent on a constant us dollar basis reflecting higher occupancy rate increases and the impact of tight cost controls in 2011  at properties in our system partially offset by higher propertylevel compensation these same factors contributed to north american companyoperated house profit margins increasing by 70  basis points compared to 2010  and hppar at those same properties increased by 81  percent international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 40  basis points and hppar at those properties increased by 67  percent reflecting increased demand and higher revpar in most locations and continued tight propertylevel cost controls partially offset by higher propertylevel compensation and the effects of revpar declines in the middle east 

2010 compared to 2009 

we added 154 properties 28114 rooms and 31 properties 6072 rooms exited the system in 2010 these figures do not include residential or execustay units we also added three residential properties 442 units and one residential property 25 units exited the system in 2010 

total segment financial results increased by 979 million to 983 million in 2010 from 4 million in 2009 and total segment revenues increased by 780 million to 11611 million in 2010 a 7 percent increase from revenues of 10831 million in 2009 

the yearoveryear increase in revenues included a 557 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to marriott the results compared to 2009 reflected a favorable variance from 685 million of 2009 timeshare strategyimpairment charges 614 million of which were reported in the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” caption and 71 million of which were reported in the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges nonoperating” caption of our income statements an increase of 116 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 19 million of decreased general administrative and other expenses a 73 million increase in base management and franchise fees to 1003 million in 2010 from 930 million in 2009 a 48 million decrease in restructuring costs 35 million of lower joint venture equity losses 28 million of higher incentive management fees to 182 

million in 2010 from 154 million in 2009 an increase of 21 million in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses and a 21 million increase in gains and other income these favorable variances were partially offset by 55 million of increased interest expense and an 11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest benefit for more detailed information on the variances see the preceding sections beginning with “operating income loss” 

in 2010 27 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 25 percent in 2009 in addition in 2010 65 percent of our incentive fees were derived from properties outside of the continental united states versus 67 percent in 2009 

see “statistics” below for detailed information on systemwide revpar and companyoperated revpar by segment region and brand 

compared to 2009 worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins in 2010 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable companyoperated hppar increased by 64 percent on a constant us dollar basis reflecting the impact of tight cost controls in 2010 at properties in our system and increased demand partially offset by decreased average daily rates north american companyoperated house profit margins were nearly unchanged as compared to 2009 while hppar at those same properties increased by 38 percent reflecting increased demand and tight cost controls at properties partially offset by decreased average daily rates and lower cancellation and attrition fees international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 120 basis points and hppar at those properties increased by 106 percent reflecting increased demand and continued tight propertylevel cost controls 

lodging development 

we opened 206  properties totaling 30856  rooms across our brands in 2011 and 30  properties  6262  rooms left the system not including residential products or execustay we also added four  residential properties  753  units and no residential properties left the system highlights of the year included 

 

we currently have over 110000  hotel rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 30000  hotel rooms gross to our system in 2012 

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

the following tables show occupancy average daily rate and revpar for comparable properties for each of the brands in our north american fullservice and north american limitedservice segments for our international segment by region and the principal brand in our luxury segment the ritzcarlton we have not presented statistics for companyoperated fairfield inn  suites properties in these tables because the brand is predominantly franchised and we operate very few properties so such information would not be meaningful identified as “nm” in the tables that follow systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties 

the occupancy average daily rate and revpar statistics we use throughout this report for 2011  include the 52 weeks from january 1 2011  through december 30 2011  for 2010  include the 52 weeks from january 2 2010  through december 31 2010  and for 2009  include the 52 weeks from january 3 2009  through january 1 2010  except in each case for the ritzcarlton brand properties and properties located outside of the united states which for those properties includes the period from january 1 through december 31 for each year

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

on june 23 2011  we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement the “credit facility” to extend the facility’s expiration from may 14 2012  to june 23 2016  and reduce at our direction the facility size from 2404 billion  to 1750 billion  of aggregate effective borrowings the material terms of the amended and restated credit facility are otherwise unchanged and the facility continues to support general corporate needs including working capital capital expenditures and letters of credit the availability of the credit facility also supports our commercial paper program borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating for additional information on our credit facility including participating financial institutions see exhibit 10 “second amended and restated credit agreement” to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on june 27 2011 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets together with cash we expect to generate from operations remains adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

in early 2011 we resumed issuing commercial paper in the united states we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper therefore our issuances are subject to market demand we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature we do not expect fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper to affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

at yearend 2011  our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1520 billion  and reflected borrowing capacity of 1418 billion  under our credit facility and our cash balance of 102 million  we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking 1750 billion  of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting  1 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility and  331 million  of outstanding commercial paper we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at yearend 2011  we anticipate that available borrowing capacity under the credit facility will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs including repayment of debt obligations since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we also expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

cash from operations 

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 05 to 10 at yearend 2011 and 14 to 10 at yearend 2010 see footnote no 17 spinoff of the notes to our financial statements for information on the spinoff in 2011 and related decrease in current assets we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to 

this 2011 annual report on form 10k are as follows 

  



 timeshare cash flows 

while our former timeshare segment historically generated positive operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varied based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we included timeshare reportable sales we financed in cash from operations when we collected cash payments we show the net operating activity from our former timeshare segment prior to the spinoff which does not include income from our timeshare segment in the following table in 2011 2010 and 2009 new timeshare segment mortgages totaled  214 million   256 million  and 302 million  respectively and collections totaled  273 million  which included collections on securitized notes of  187 million   347 million  which included collections on securitized notes of  230 million  and 155 million  respectively 



for additional information on our timeshare note securitizations including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes see footnote no 11 “asset securitizations” of the notes to our financial statements 

for additional information on the spinoff please see footnote no 17 spinoff of the notes to our financial statements we expect that the spinoff will result in the realization through 2015 of approximately 400 million to 450 million of cash tax benefits to marriott including approximately 115 million to 125 million for the 2012 fiscal year relating to the value of the timeshare business for 2011 we realized approximately 80 million of these cash tax benefits 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 183 million  in 2011 307 million  in 2010 and 147 million  in 2009 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives timeshare segment development expenditures which we included in “cash from operations” prior to the spinoff as noted in that section were not reflected in these numbers capital expenditures in 2011 decreased primarily due to the purchase of two hotels in 2010 capital expenditures in 2010 increased primarily due to the purchase of two hotel properties we expect investment spending for the 2012 fiscal year will total approximately 550 million  to 750 million  including 50 million  to 100 million  for maintenance capital spending investment spending will also include other capital expenditures including property acquisitions loan advances contract acquisition costs and equity and other investments 

over time we have sold lodging properties under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions we expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these 

investments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging segment because 1 we own less than one percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions  property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 20 million  in 2011 114 million  in 2010 and 2 million  in 2009 

loan activity  from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise collections and sales for such loans net of advances during 2011 and 2010 amounted to net loan collections of 84 million  in 2011 and net loan advances of 6 million  in 2010 at yearend 2011 we had no senior loans and 382 million in mezzanine and other loans including a current portion of 84 million outstanding compared with no senior loans and 191 million in mezzanine and other loans including a current portion of 7 million outstanding at yearend 2010 in 2011 our notes receivable balance associated with senior mezzanine and other loans increased by 191 million  and primarily reflected   the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans see the “senior mezzanine and other loans” caption in footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information 

equity and cost method investments  cash outflows of 83 million  in 2011 29 million  in 2010 and 28 million  in 2009 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures 

cash from financing activities 

debt  debt decreased by 658 million  in 2011 to 2171 million  at yearend 2011 from 2829 million  at yearend 2010 and reflected a 1016 million  decrease in nonrecourse debt associated with previously securitized notes which we transferred to mvw as part of the spinoff partially offset by a  331 million  increase in commercial paper and other debt which includes capital leases increases of  27 million    debt increased by 531 million in 2010 to 2829 million at yearend 2010 from 2298 million at yearend 2009 and reflected consolidation of debt with a balance at yearend 2010 of 1016 million partially offset by decreased borrowings under our credit facility of 425 million and other net debt decreases of 60 million 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2011 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 50 percent and an average maturity of approximately 36 years the ratio of fixedrate longterm debt to total longterm debt was 082 to 10 at yearend 2011 

see the “cash requirements and our credit facilities” caption within this “liquidity and capital resources” section for additional information on our credit facility 

during 2010 we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility which had a balance outstanding at yearend 2009 of 425 million 

in 2009 we repurchased 122 million principal amount of our senior notes in the open market across multiple series we recorded a gain of 21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debt’s purchase price of 98 million and its carrying amount of 119 million 

share repurchases  we purchased 434 million shares of our class a common stock in 2011 at an average price of 3279 per share purchased 15 million shares in 2010 at an average price of 3902 per share and did not purchase any shares in 2009 as of yearend 2011 55 million  shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations previously approved by our board of directors on february 10 2012 we announced that our board of directors increased by 35 million  shares the authorization to repurchase our class a common stock we purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions

we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ® best rate guarantee gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our website or any other marriott reservation channel also key to our success is our strong marriott rewards program our ritzcarlton rewards program and our informationrich and easytouse wwwmarriottcom website our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective with over 3500 properties in our system economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and enhance our fee revenue 

with 75 percent of our guests saying they use our website when planning or booking their stays and with over 6 billion in annual propertylevel gross revenues wwwmarriottcom is one of the largest online retail sites in the world based on sales in 2010 we introduced a number of new enhancements to the wwwmarriottcom booking mobile and search engine experience that are designed to generate more revenue and further reduce booking costs 

marriott’s sales transformation is a sales deployment strategy that aligns sales efforts around customer needs reduces duplication of sales efforts and enables coverage for a larger number of accounts we consider our sales transformation strategy to be a key competitive advantage for marriott the rollout of sales transformation which began in late 2007 is scheduled for completion by mid2011 

  

building on more than 20 years of energy conservation experience we are committed to protecting the environment our “spirit to preserve ® ” environmental strategy calls for greening our 10 billion supply chain further reducing fuel and water consumption expanding our portfolio of green hotels and buildings educating and inspiring employees and guests to support the environment and investing in innovative largescale conservation projects worldwide 

we are the first in the hospitality industry to launch a green hotel prototype that has been preapproved by us green building council “usgbc” as part of its leadership in energy and environment design “leed” volume program meaning that any hotel that follows these plans will earn basic leed certification or possibly higher upon final usgbc approval the us travel association confirms that travelers place the importance of supporting environmentally responsible travel service suppliers as a necessity even in an economic downturn 

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising there are approximately 870 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

during the recent recession we experienced significant reductions in demand for hotel rooms and timeshare products particularly in 2009 and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience while demand trends globally improved in 2010 additional cost reductions could become necessary to preserve operating margins if demand trends reverse but we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2010 approximately 69 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is concentrated with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have approximately a ten percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a one percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties competitor hotels converting to one of marriott’s brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

  

the vacation ownership industry is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies since entering the timeshare industry in 1984 we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide competition in the timeshare interval fractional and residential business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts trust in the brand the pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits such as exchange programs we believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences combined with our financial strength diverse market presence strong brands and wellmaintained properties will enable us to remain competitive approximately 74 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales came from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners in 2010 as compared to 65 percent in 2009 the increase in 2010 reflected our customer service marketing and sales efforts which initially focused on the existing owner base after the launch of marriott vacation club destinations timeshare program in june 

marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards are our frequent guest programs with over 34 million members and 12 participating brands the rewards programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 30 participating airline programs we believe that our rewards programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2010 approximately 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by rewards program members in addition the ability of timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brands we continue to enhance our rewards program offerings and specifically and strategically market to this large and growing customer base our loyal rewards member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts 

discontinued operations 

synthetic fuel 

prior to 2008 we operated four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” because tax credits under section 45k of the us internal revenue code “irc” were not available for coalbased synthetic fuel produced or sold after calendar yearend 2007 we shut down the facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel in late 2007 accordingly we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation see footnote no 3 “discontinued operations – synthetic fuel” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation of properties and our development of properties comply in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations our compliance with such provisions also has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position nor do we anticipate that such compliance will have a material impact in the future

 item 1a risk factors tableend forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the company and its financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

lodging and timeshare industry risks 

our industries are highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for customers we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas this could limit our operating margins diminish our market share and reduce our earnings 

we are subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel timeshare and corporate apartment industries the profitability of the hotels vacation timeshare resorts and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand or the prices our hotels are able to obtain for hotel rooms timeshare units residential units and corporate apartments or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profit of our lodging businesses reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans guarantees and noncontrolling equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage even where such factors do not reduce demand propertylevel profit margins may suffer if we are unable to fully recover increased operating costs from our guests similarly our fee revenue could be impacted by weak propertylevel revenue or profitability 

our hotel management and franchise agreements may also be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which the company fails or elects not to cure a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

general economic uncertainty and weak demand in the lodging and timeshare industries could continue to impact our financial results and growth weak economic conditions in the united states europe and much of the rest of the world and the uncertainty over the duration of these conditions could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging and timeshare industries as a result of current economic conditions we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms and timeshare products recent improvements in demand trends globally may not continue and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery was to stall or conditions were to worsen 

proposed spinoff risk 

the proposed spinoff of our timeshare division may not occur as or when planned or at all or could result in issues we do not yet anticipate unanticipated developments could delay prevent the completion of or otherwise adversely affect the proposed spinoff of our timeshare division including any problems or delays in obtaining financing for the new timeshare company regulatory approvals thirdparty consents a favorable letter ruling from the internal revenue service or disruptions either in general market conditions or in the lodging or timeshare business the transaction is also subject to final approval by our board of directors completion of the proposed spinoff may require significant time effort and expense and may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations which could adversely affect those operations any delays in completion of the proposed spinoff may increase the amount of time effort and expense that we devote to the transaction moreover we may not be able to complete the spinoff on the terms currently anticipated as a result of financing issues or accommodations we may have to make to obtain the consent of regulators or other third parties 

in addition if we complete the proposed spinoff the actual results may differ materially from the results we anticipate specifically the proposed transaction could adversely affect our relationships with our customers or employees including those of the timeshare division or disrupt our operations the separated businesses could also face unanticipated problems in operating independently and thus may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the separation 

operational risks 

our lodging operations are subject to global regional and national conditions because we conduct our business on a global platform our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of both global and regional 

  

economies in recent years our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from weak economic conditions and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future economic performance could be similarly affected by the economic environment in each of the regions in which we operate the resulting unknown pace of business travel and the occurrence of any future incidents in those regions 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the united states also makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business we currently operate or franchise hotels and resorts in 70 countries and our operations outside the united states represented approximately 16 percent of our revenues in 2010 we expect that the international share of our total revenues will increase in future years as a result we are increasingly exposed to a number of challenges and risks associated with doing business outside the united states including the following any of which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs or disrupt our business 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of governments that may impact our operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us laws that affect the activities of us companies abroad 3 limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax effective manner 4 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 5 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws and 6 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation 

our new programs and new branded products may not be successful we cannot assure that our recently launched edition and autograph collection brands and marriott vacation club destination pointsbased timeshare program the expected launch of ac hotels by marriott or any new programs or products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public or other customers we also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing the brands or any new programs or products or that the brands or any new programs or products will be successful in addition some of our new brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with one or more third parties including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural or manmade disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters manmade disasters such as the recent oil spill in the gulf of mexico and the spread of contagious diseases such as h1n1 flu avian flu and sars in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers could cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

disagreements with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation or may delay implementation of product or service initiatives consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements which may include disagreements over the need for or payment for new product or service initiatives such disagreements may be more likely while hotel returns are weaker as a result of the 2008 – 2009 economic slow down we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but are not always able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

damage to or other potential losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or 

  

that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

development and financing risks 

while w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties we depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and to develop timeshare properties and we or our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control instability in the financial markets following the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the contraction of available liquidity and leverage continue to constrain the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments in addition owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity while lenders have shown a willingness to work with borrowers to extend relief in the short to medium term some current and prospective hotel owners are still finding new hotel financing on commercially viable terms to be challenging 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks we develop new hotel timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the 2009 impairment charges associated with our timeshare business our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to further decreases in demand for residential fractional or interval ownership increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for these projects that are not pursued to completion 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in the current difficult business environment 

  

other risks associated with timeshare and residential properties 

disruption in the credit markets could impair our ability to securitize the loans that our timeshare business generates our timeshare business provides financing to purchasers of our timeshare and fractional properties and we periodically securitize interests in those loans in the capital markets disruption in the credit markets in the second half of 2008 and much of 2009 impaired the timing and volume of the timeshare loans that we securitized as well as the financial terms of such securitizations improved market conditions in 2010 allowed us to successfully complete a securitization in the fourth quarter of 2010 on substantially more favorable terms nonetheless any future deterioration in the financial markets could preclude delay or increase the cost to us of future note securitizations which could in turn cause us to reduce spending in order to maintain our leverage and return targets 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties that are associated with our lodging and timeshare properties or brands may reduce our profits in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate through noncontrolling interests andor licensing fees in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including luxury residences and condominiums under our ritzcarlton and marriott brands such projects pose additional risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging and timeshare businesses which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 

 

  

  

 purchaser defaults on the loans our timeshare business generates could reduce our timeshare revenues and profits we are also subject to the risk of default on the financing we provide to purchasers of our timeshare and fractional properties purchaser defaults could force us to foreclose on the loan and reclaim ownership of the financed property both for loans that we have not securitized and in our role as servicer for the loans we have securitized if we cannot resell foreclosed properties in a timely manner or at a price sufficient to repay the loans and our costs we could incur losses or impairment charges on loans we have yet to securitize or loss of future income from our residual interest in loans that we have securitized 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position the lodging and timeshare industries continue to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards and the ritzcarlton rewards programs and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis if we are unable to do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our business some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s look no further ® best rate guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ® and yahoo ® to steer customers toward their websites a practice currently being challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from wwwmarriottcom  or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels 

  

failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions operational inefficiencies damage of reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits  our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems and those of our service providers we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to us if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is also increasingly demanding in both the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and employee and customer expectations or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so our information systems and records including those we maintain with our service providers may be subject to security breaches system failures viruses operator error or inadvertent releases of data a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data maintained by us or by a service provider could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines or litigation a breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the telemarketing sales rule canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing email and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

other risks 

changes in tax and other laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of laws regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world in response to the recent economic crisis and the recent recession we anticipate that many of the jurisdictions in which we do business will review tax and other revenue raising laws regulations and policies and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits in particular governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our nonus operations or that could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured for example most us company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the united states is generally taxed at local rates which are often much lower than us tax rates if changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations were to significantly increase the tax rates on nonus income our effective tax rate could increase our profits could be reduced and if such increases were a result of our status as a us company could place us at a disadvantage to our nonus competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we are not able to recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes in connection with mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder’s rights plan to replace the stockholder’s rights plan that expired in march 2008

 weak economic conditions in much of the world instability in the financial markets and weak consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2009 we responded aggressively to the economic climate by reducing costs and lowering investment spending throughout the company and taking decisive measures to enhance our liquidity and manage our balance sheet accordingly our board of directors the “board” declared stock dividends rather than cash dividends in each of the 2009 second third and fourth quarters while the board again declared a cash dividend in response to the improving business environment of 004 per share in the 2010 first second and third quarters and a cash dividend of 00875 per share in the 2010 fourth quarter each quarter the board considers whether and in what form to declare a dividend

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend business and overview 

we are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3545 properties 618104 rooms and related facilities the figures in the preceding sentence are as of yearend 2010 and include 34 home and condominium products 3391 units for which we manage the related owners’ associations in addition we provided 2043 furnished corporate housing rental units which are not included in the totals 

our operations are grouped into five business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging luxury lodging and timeshare we operate develop and franchise under numerous separate brand names in 70 countries and territories 

we earn base incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease we also generate revenues from the following sources associated with our timeshare segment 1 selling timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties 2 operating the resorts and residential properties 3 financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals and 4 rentals finally we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate 

during 2010 we broadened our timeshare interval product offering to include the sale of the pointsbased marriott vacation club destinations timeshare program in north america and the caribbean the marriott vacation club destinations timeshare program offers greater flexibility further personalization and more experience opportunities for participating timeshare owners see the “marriott vacation club destinations timeshare program” caption later in this form 10k for additional information 

we sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a standalone basis under the ritzcarlton brand the ritzcarlton residences and in conjunction with timeshare segment projects the ritzcarlton destination club and grand residences by marriottresidential our timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time other residences are typically constructed and sold by thirdparty developers with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk while the worldwide residential market is very large the luxurious nature of our residential properties the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands and the hospitality services that we provide all serve to make our residential properties distinctive 

lodging 

business conditions for our lodging business improved in 2010 while the recent recession significantly impacted lodging demand and hotel pricing occupancies began to improve late in 2009 and that improvement continued throughout 2010 room rates began to stabilize and improve in some markets in the 2010 second quarter and that improvement continued strengthened and expanded to other markets throughout the rest of 2010 in 2010 worldwide average daily rates on a constant dollar basis stayed the same as 2009 for companyoperated properties worldwide revpar for companyoperated properties increased 63 percent on a constant dollar basis for 2010 as compared to 2009 and occupancy increased 41 percentage points to 687 percent 

while worldwide revpar for 2010 remained well below 2008 levels we continued to see strengthening in properties in asia europe the caribbean latin america and in our luxury properties around the world our hotels in asia are particularly benefitting from strong economic growth in that region additionally hotels in north america experienced stronger demand from corporate transient and association group customers in 2010 as compared to 2009 and that demand continued to strengthen progressively during the 2010 period however propertylevel banquet and catering spending continues to be weak primarily reflecting tight budgets and fewer group functions although we did experience some improvement late in 2010 during the 2010 first quarter group meeting cancellations declined to typical levels and expected revenue from group meetings continued to improve throughout 2010 while our booking windows for both group business and transient business remain very short our pace of bookings for group business for future periods continued to improve throughout 2010 

we monitor market conditions continuously and carefully price our rooms daily to meet individual hotel demand levels we modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes demand for higher rated rooms improved in 2010 which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business this mix improvement benefited average daily rates at many hotels 

negotiated corporate business “special corporate business” represented 14 percent of our fullservice hotel room nights for 2010 in north america by late 2010 demand trends had further strengthened and we had negotiated rates with more 

  

than twothirds of our 2011 special corporate rate clients those rates were meaningfully higher than those we negotiated in 2009 and early 2010 we typically negotiate and fix room rates associated with special corporate business in advance of the year to which they apply which limits our ability to raise these rates quickly we expect to complete negotiations with our remaining special corporate business clients in the 2011 first quarter in negotiating pricing for this segment of business we do not focus strictly on volume but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our customers including for example stay patterns day of week and season locations of stays nonroom spend and aggregate spend 

group business pricing is also inflexible in the near term as some group business may be booked several years in advance of guest arrival however as a result of the recent recession shorter group booking windows became more common for 2010 than they were in prior years accordingly with strengthening demand group business booked in 2010 showed stronger price improvement than business booked in 2009 and “intheyearfortheyear” bookings also increased in 2010 

properties in our system are maintaining very tight cost controls as we continue to focus on enhancing propertylevel house profit margins where appropriate for market conditions we have maintained many of our 2009 propertylevel cost saving initiatives such as adjusting menus and restaurant hours modifying room amenities crosstraining personnel utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible and not filling some vacant positions we also reduced aboveproperty costs which are allocated to hotels by scaling back systems processing and support areas in addition we have not filled certain aboveproperty vacant positions and have required where legally permitted and elsewhere encouraged employees to use their vacation time accrued during 2010 

our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels rather than owning them at yearend 2010 we operated 45 percent of the hotel rooms in our system under management agreements our franchisees operated 53 percent under franchise agreements and we owned or leased 2 percent our emphasis on longterm management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while the addition of new hotels to our system generates growth this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry in addition we increase our financial flexibility by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we make 

we consider revpar which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues references to revpar throughout this report are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted 

companyoperated house profit margin is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit also known as house profit to total propertylevel revenue we consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control house profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses house profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

for our north american comparable properties systemwide revpar which includes data from our franchised managed owned and leased properties increased by 49 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting improved occupancy levels in most markets partially offset by a modest decline in average daily rates for our properties outside north america systemwide revpar for 2010 increased 92 percent versus 2009 reflecting improved occupancy levels partially offset by a modest decline in average daily rates 

timeshare 

we launched the pointsbased marriott vacation club destinations timeshare program “mvcd program” in north america and the caribbean in june 2010 and we are initially focusing our marketing efforts on existing customers as a result in 2010 contract sales to existing owners increased 31 percent while sales to new customers declined we expect accelerated sales to new customers in 2011 see the “marriott vacation club destinations timeshare program” caption later in this form 10k for additional information 

contract sales for our timeshare fractional and residential products increased modestly in 2010 compared to 2009 largely due to a decline in contract sales cancellation allowances we adjust our contract sales for cancellation allowances that we record in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to preclosing contract cancellations at the same time contract sales were constrained by difficult comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009 by the end of 2010 timeshare pricing improved because we had largely discontinued or reduced the purchase incentives and targeted marketing efforts instituted in 2009 

  

rental revenues increased in 2010 with stronger leisure demand for our marriott vacation club product and greater available rental inventory demand for fractional and residential units remains weak sales and marketing costs as a percentage of contract sales continue to improve as with lodging our timeshare properties continue to maintain very tight cost controls and we have not filled certain vacant positions and have required where legally permitted and elsewhere encouraged employees to use their vacation time accrued during 2010 

since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentageofcompletion accounting method current demand may not always be reflected in our timeshare segment results until later accounting periods 

on january 2 2010 the first day of our 2010 fiscal year we adopted the new transfers of financial assets and consolidation standards as a result of adopting these standards in the 2010 first quarter we consolidated 13 existing qualifying special purpose entities associated with past securitization transactions and we recorded a onetime noncash aftertax reduction to shareholders’ equity of 146 million 238 million pretax in the 2010 first quarter representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

see footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to our financial statements for more detailed information on our adoption of these new accounting topics including the impact to our balance sheet and statement of income 

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2010 2009 and 2008 

continuing operations 

revenues 

2010 compared to 2009 

revenues increased by 783 million 7 percent to 11691 million in 2010 from 10908 million in 2009 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue 557 million timeshare sales and services revenue 98 million base management and franchise fees 73 million incentive management fees 28 million comprised of a 12 million increase for north america and a 16 million increase outside of north america and owned leased corporate housing and other revenue 27 million 

the increase in timeshare sales and services revenue to 1221 million in 2010 from 1123 million in 2009 primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income and to a lesser extent higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancy levels and rates these favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily associated with tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009 a 20 million increase in reserves we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default and lower sales to new customers in our initial launch of the mvcd program see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our timeshare segment 

the increases in base management fees to 562 million in 2010 from 530 million in 2009 and in franchise fees to 441 million in 2010 from 400 million in 2009 primarily reflected stronger revpar and the impact of unit growth across the system the increase in incentive management fees to 182 million in 2010 from 154 million in 2009 primarily reflected higher propertylevel revenue and continued tight propertylevel cost controls that improved 2010 margins compared to 2009 and to a lesser extent new unit growth 

the increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue to 1046 million in 2010 from 1019 million in 2009 largely reflected 14 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees associated with six properties that exited our system 8 million of higher branding fees 6 million of higher revenue for owned and leased properties and 5 million of higher other revenue partially offsetting these favorable variances was a onetime 6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009 the increase in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected increased revpar and occupancy levels combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled 78 million and 70 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income attributable to us the increase in cost reimbursements revenue to 8239 million in 2010 from 7682 million in 2009 reflected the impact of growth across the system partially offset by lower propertylevel 

  

costs in response to cost controls net of hotels exiting the system we added 4287 managed rooms and 17024 franchised rooms to our system in 2010 

2009 compared to 2008 

revenues decreased by 1971 million 15 percent to 10908 million in 2009 from 12879 million in 2008 as a result of lower cost reimbursements revenue 1152 million timeshare sales and services revenue 300 million owned leased corporate housing and other revenue 206 million incentive management fees 157 million comprised of 108 million for north america and 49 million outside of north america base management fees 105 million comprised of 79 million for north america and 26 million outside of north america and franchise fees 51 million 

the decrease in cost reimbursements revenue to 7682 million in 2009 from 8834 million in 2008 reflected lower propertylevel costs in response to lower occupancy and cost controls partially offset by the impact of growth across the system we added 35 managed properties 8574 rooms and 200 franchised properties 25136 rooms to our system in 2009 net of properties exiting the system 

the decrease in timeshare sales and services revenue of 300 million 21 percent to 1123 million in 2009 from 1423 million in 2008 primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent residential products and the asia pacific points program as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009 and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue the decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to 2008 and higher financing revenue see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our timeshare segment 

the decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue to 1019 million in 2009 from 1225 million in 2008 largely reflected 183 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties 19 million of lower revenue associated with our corporate housing business 14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees and 5 million of lower branding fees associated with the sale of residential real estate partially offset by 11 million of increased branding fees associated with our affinity credit card and a 3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008 and as a result was not operating at full capacity combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled 70 million and 64 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected revpar declines associated with weak lodging demand 

the decrease in incentive management fees to 154 million in 2009 from 311 million in 2008 reflected lower propertylevel revenue associated with weak demand lower revpar and the associated lower propertylevel operating income and margins in 2009 compared to 2008 most incentive management fees are earned only after each hotel earns a minimum return for the hotel’s owner with particularly weak demand and low propertylevel operating income in 2009 most managed hotels did not have sufficient operating income to allow us to earn an incentive fee in 2009 only 25 percent of managed hotels paid incentive fees to us as compared to 56 percent in 2008 the decreases in base management fees to 530 million in 2009 from 635 million in 2008 and franchise fees to 400 million in 2009 from 451 million in 2008 both reflected revpar declines driven by weaker demand partially offset by the favorable impact of unit growth across the system 

timeshare strategyimpairment charges 

in 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling 752 million in our income statement 502 million aftertax including 614 million of pretax charges that impacted operating income under the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” caption and 138 million of pretax charges that impacted nonoperating income under the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges nonoperating” caption the 752 million of pretax impairment charges were noncash other than 27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and 21 million of charges for purchase commitments 

see footnote no 18 “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information including a table showing the composition of the charges 

restructuring costs and other charges 

as a result of the restructuring actions we began in the fourth quarter of 2008 we incurred 55 million in restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2008 as part of these actions we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our timeshare segment hotel development aboveproperty level management and corporate overhead these further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of 51 million in 2009 for additional information on the 2008 and 2009 restructuring costs including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment please see footnote no 21 “restructuring costs and other charges” of the notes to the financial statements in our 2009 form 10k for the cumulative restructuring costs incurred since inception and a roll forward of the restructuring liability through yearend 

  

2010 please see footnote no 19 “restructuring costs and other charges” of the notes to our financial statements in this form 10k 

as a result of our restructuring efforts we realized the following annual cost savings in 2010 which were primarily reflected in our income statement under the expense captions noted i 113 million 73 million aftertax for our timeshare segment under “timesharedirect” and “general administrative and other” ii 12 million 8 million aftertax for hotel development across several of our lodging segments primarily under “general administrative and other” and iii 10 million 8 million aftertax for reducing above propertylevel lodging management personnel under “general administrative and other” 

operating income loss 

2010 compared to 2009 

operating income increased by 847 million to operating income of 695 million in 2010 from an operating loss of 152 million in 2009 the increase in operating income reflected a favorable variance of 614 million related to timeshare strategyimpairment charges recorded in 2009 116 million of higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses a 73 million increase in base management and franchise fees a 51 million decrease in restructuring costs 28 million of higher incentive management fees and 23 million of higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by a 58 million increase in general administrative and other expenses we note the reasons for the increase of 73 million in base management and franchise fees as well as the increase of 28 million in incentive management fees as compared to 2009 in the preceding “revenues” section 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2010 totaled 199 million the increase of 116 million as compared to 2009 primarily reflected 78 million of higher financing revenue net of expenses which largely reflected increased interest income associated with the impact of consolidating previously unconsolidated securitized notes under the new transfers of financial assets and consolidation standards 33 million of higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 8 million of higher other revenue net of expenses partially offset by 3 million of lower services revenue net of expenses higher development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected both lower product costs due to lower sales volumes and lower marketing and selling costs in 2010 as well as favorable variances from both a 10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority and a net 3 million impact from contract cancellation allowances in 2009 partially offset by lower development revenue for the reasons stated in the preceding “revenues” section see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our timeshare segment 

the 23 million 34 percent increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to 12 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees net of property closing costs 8 million of higher branding fees a 4 million reversal of a liability related to a hotel that closed in 2010 and net stronger results at some owned and leased properties due to higher revpar and propertylevel margins partially offset by additional rent expense associated with one property and an unfavorable variance from a onetime 6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 58 million 8 percent to 780 million in 2010 from 722 million in 2009 the increase primarily reflected the following 2010 charges an 84 million longlived asset impairment associated with a capitalized revenue management software asset which we did not allocate to any of our segments a 13 million longlived asset impairment allocated to our timeshare segment and a 14 million longlived asset impairment allocated to our north american limitedservice segment see footnote no 8 “property and equipment” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information regarding these three impairment charges in addition we recorded a 4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge allocated to our north american fullservice segment in 2010 see the north american fullservice segment discussion for additional information regarding this impairment charge also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was 35 million of higher incentive compensation costs 14 million of increased other expenses primarily associated with initiatives to enhance our brands globally 7 million of increased currency exchange losses and 2 million of increased legal expenses these unfavorable variances were partially offset by an 8 million reversal in 2010 of guarantee accruals primarily related to a completion guarantee for which we satisfied the related requirements and a 4 million reversal of excess accruals for net asset tax based on the receipt of final assessments from a taxing authority located outside the united states in addition the comparison reflects the following 2009 expenses that we did not incur in 2010 49 million of impairment charges related to two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due in part to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls partially offset by an 11 million reversal of the 2008 accrual for the funding of those cash flow shortfalls a 7 million writeoff of timeshare segment capitalized software costs and 4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance the yearoveryear comparison also reflected a 15 million favorable variance in deferred compensation expenses with changes to our deferred compensation plan general administrative and other expenses for 2010 had no deferred 

  

compensation impact compared with 15 million of marktomarket valuation expenses in 2009 the increase in general administrative and other expenses was also partially offset by the elimination of the loan loss provision in 2010 compared with a 43 million provision in 2009 which reflected 29 million associated with one luxury segment project and 14 million associated with a north american limitedservice segment portfolio 

the 58 million increase in total general administrative and other expenses was comprised of a 77 million increase that we did not allocate to any of our segments a 5 million increase impacting our timeshare segment an 8 million decrease impacting our north american limitedservice segment an 8 million decrease impacting our luxury segment a 7 million decrease impacting our north american fullservice segment and a 1 million decrease impacting our international segment 

2009 compared to 2008 

operating income decreased by 917 million 120 percent to an operating loss of 152 million in 2009 from operating income of 765 million in 2008 the decrease in operating income reflected timeshare strategyimpairment charges in 2009 of 614 million 157 million of lower incentive management fees a 156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees 69 million of lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 6 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by an 81 million decrease in general administrative and other expenses and a decrease in restructuring costs of 4 million in the preceding “revenues” section we note the reasons for the decrease of 157 million in incentive management fees as well as the decrease of 156 million in combined base management and franchise fees as compared to 2008 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2009 totaled 83 million the decline of 6 million 7 percent from 89 million in 2008 primarily reflected 50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses mostly offset by 43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses 15 million of higher other revenue net of expenses and 3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses lower development revenue net of product marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent lower revenue net of costs for our asia pacific points program and a 10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a 22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate 10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit and a 9 million 2008 inventory writedown related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in europe higher financing revenue net of financing expenses reflected higher note securitization gains increased residual interest accretion a decrease in the adjustment to the fair market value of residual interests and a decrease in the cost of financing partially offset by lower interest income lower services revenue net of expenses reflected weak demand for rentals and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory see “business segments timeshare” later in this section for additional information regarding our timeshare segment 

the 69 million 50 percent decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to a decline of 65 million in revenue net of expenses primarily associated with weaker demand at owned and leased properties as well as our corporate housing business 14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees and 5 million of lower branding fees associated with sale of residential real estate partially offset by 11 million of increased branding fees associated with our affinity credit card and a 3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008 and as a result was not operating at full capacity 

general administrative and other expenses decreased by 81 million 10 percent to 722 million in 2009 from 803 million in 2008 the decrease primarily reflected 186 million of lower expenses largely due to cost savings generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008 and lower incentive compensation as well as a 12 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008 additionally in 2009 we reached final settlement regarding the delta airlines lease investment and recorded a 3 million recovery of the investment previously reserved in the “general administrative and other” expense caption on our income statement for additional information regarding the delta airlines lease investment see the “investment in leveraged lease” caption in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our 2008 form 10k these benefits were partially offset by the following items 49 million of impairment charges for two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due in part to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls partially offset by a 15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an 11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls 2009 provisions for loan losses of 43 million for two loans partially offset by a 22 million favorable variance from a 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan an 8 million impairment charge related to the writeoff of contract acquisition costs for one property a 7 million writeoff of timeshare segment capitalized software costs 12 million of expenses primarily related to writeoffs of other assets that we deemed nonrecoverable performance cure accruals and guarantee accruals associated with 12 hotels and 4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance additionally 2009 included a 15 million unfavorable impact 

  

associated with deferred compensation expenses compared to a 28 million favorable impact in 2008 both of which reflected marktomarket valuations of the 81 million decrease in total general administrative and other expenses a 1 million increase was attributable to our lodging segments a 31 million decrease was attributable to our timeshare segment and a 51 million decrease was unallocated 

gains losses and other income expense 

the table below shows our gains losses and other income for 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 2010 compared to 2009 

we did not extinguish any debt in 2010 in 2009 we repurchased 122 million principal amount of our senior notes in the open market across multiple series the 21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the 98 million purchase price and the 119 million net carrying amount of senior notes we repurchased during the period the 5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities for additional information on the impairment see footnote no 5 “fair value measurements” of the notes to the financial statements in our 2009 form 10k 

2009 compared to 2008 

see the previous paragraph for information on our debt extinguishment and impairment of equity securities in 2009 we did not extinguish any debt in 2008 

interest expense 

2010 compared to 2009 

interest expense increased by 62 million 53 percent to 180 million in 2010 compared to 118 million in 2009 this increase was driven by 1 the consolidation of 1121 million of debt in the 2010 first quarter associated with previously securitized notes which resulted in a 55 million increase in interest expense in 2010 related to that debt 2 a 14 million unfavorable variance from 2009 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2010 associated with construction projects and 3 12 million of higher interest expense in 2010 associated with our executive deferred compensation plan these increases were partially offset by 1 12 million of lower interest expense associated with our repurchase of 122 million of principal amount of our senior notes in 2009 the maturity of our series c senior notes in the 2009 fourth quarter and other net debt reductions and 2 a 7 million decrease in interest expense associated with our 24 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility our “credit facility” which primarily reflected lower average borrowings 

2009 compared to 2008 

interest expense decreased by 45 million 28 percent to 118 million in 2009 compared to 163 million in 2008 interest expense associated with commercial paper and our credit facility decreased by 25 million reflecting the repayment of our commercial paper in 2008 and increased borrowings under the credit facility with a lower interest rate we also benefited from a 26 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners including our marriott rewards gift certificates and selfinsurance programs as a result of lower interest rates and the repurchase of some of our senior notes across multiple series in the 2008 fourth quarter and 2009 first quarter see “liquidity and capital resources” in our 2009 form 10k for additional information which resulted in a 12 million reduction to interest expense and finally other interest expense decreases of 5 million these decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a 23 million unfavorable variance to 2008 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2009 associated with construction projects 

interest income and income tax 

2010 compared to 2009 

interest income decreased by 6 million 24 percent to 19 million in 2010 from 25 million in 2009 primarily reflecting a 4 million decrease associated with a loan that we determined was impaired in 2009 because we recognize 

  

interest on impaired loans on a cash basis we did not recognize any interest on this loan after its impairment the decline in interest income also reflected a 2 million decrease due to a reduction in principal due associated with one loan 

our income tax expense increased by 158 million 243 percent to a provision of 93 million in 2010 from a benefit of 65 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to pretax income in 2010 as compared to a pretax loss in 2009 and 14 million of higher tax expense associated with changes to our deferred compensation plan there were no 2010 plan changes impacting deferred compensation expenses compared with changes which had a 14 million favorable impact in 2009 the increase was partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2010 as 2009 reflected 52 million of income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain nonus subsidiaries in the 2010 fourth quarter we settled issues with the internal revenue service “irs” on our treatment of funds received from certain nonus subsidiaries in conjunction with that settlement we recorded an 85 million benefit to our income tax provision in 2010 our 2010 income tax expense also reflected a 12 million benefit we recorded primarily associated with revisions to prior years’ estimated foreign tax expense 

2009 compared to 2008 

interest income decreased by 14 million 36 percent to 25 million in 2009 from 39 million in 2008 primarily reflecting 8 million of interest income we recorded in 2008 for three loans that subsequently became impaired because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis we did not recognize any interest on these impaired loans in 2009 the decline in interest income also reflected 5 million of lower interest income due to a decline in interest rates on our cash balances 2 million of previously reserved interest income collected in 2008 and 2 million of lower interest income in 2009 reflecting a reduction in principal due associated with one loan partially offset by 4 million of additional interest income from new loans funded at yearend 2008 and in 2009 

our tax provision decreased by 415 million 119 percent to a benefit of 65 million in 2009 from a provision of 350 million in 2008 reflecting a pretax loss in 2009 and 43 million of lower tax expense associated with our deferred compensation plan the decrease was partially offset by an increase to the effective tax rate in 2009 due to a change in our mix of worldwide income resulting from substantial reductions of nonus income in jurisdictions with low tax rates the 2009 tax rate also reflected 52 million of income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain nonus subsidiaries an issue that was the subject of ongoing discussions at that time between us and the irs the charges recorded in 2009 primarily related to our then current exposure related to this issue in addition to tax expense on pretax earnings tax expense for 2008 also reflected 1 29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable us court of federal claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction 2 19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments including a settlement with the irs that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction and 3 24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain nonus subsidiaries 

equity in losses earnings 

2010 compared to 2009 

equity in losses of 18 million in 2010 decreased by 48 million from equity in losses of 66 million in 2009 and primarily reflected favorable variances from a 30 million impairment charge associated with a luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined was fully impaired and a 3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that we did not allocate to one of our segments both incurred in 2009 in the 2010 fourth quarter we also recorded an 11 million reversal of a funding liability recorded in 2009 due to progress in that quarter on certain constructionrelated legal claims and other factors see footnote no 18 “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information regarding this reversal increased earnings of 5 million for our international segment joint ventures and 3 million of lower cancellation reserves at our timeshare segment joint venture also contributed to the decrease in equity in losses a 2010 impairment charge of 5 million associated with our north american limitedservice segment joint venture partially offset the favorable impacts 

2009 compared to 2008 

equity in losses of 66 million in 2009 increased by 81 million from equity in earnings of 15 million in 2008 and primarily reflected a 30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired the decrease in joint venture equity earnings also reflected an unfavorable comparison to 15 million of equity earnings in 2008 from a joint venture that sold portfolio assets and had significant associated gains and 5 million of earnings in 2008 from another joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture further contributing to the decline were 24 million of decreased earnings in 2009 for a timeshare segment joint venture residential and fractional project 7 million of equity losses associated with a north american limitedservice segment joint venture a 3 million impairment and 2 million of other equity losses associated with an international segment joint venture and 9 million of equity losses at certain other joint ventures all of which were negatively affected by the weak demand environment the unfavorable impacts also included a 3 million impairment 

  

charge for a joint venture that is not allocated to one of our segments and for which we do not expect to recover our investment these decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable 11 million impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate and a 2008 impairment charge of 9 million associated with one luxury segment joint venture under development see footnote no 21 “restructuring costs and other charges” of the notes to the financial statements in our 2009 form 10k for more information on some of these joint venture impairments 

net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 

2010 compared to 2009 

net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 7 million in 2010 to zero compared to 7 million in 2009 the benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of 7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling 11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of 4 million associated with the losses 

2009 compared to 2008 

net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 8 million in 2009 to 7 million compared to 15 million in 2008 

income loss from continuing operations 

2010 compared to 2009 

income from continuing operations of 458 million in 2010 increased by 811 million 230 percent from a loss of 353 million in 2009 income from continuing operations attributable to marriott of 458 million in 2010 increased by 804 million 232 percent from a loss of 346 million in 2009 and diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to marriott of 121 per share increased by 218 225 percent from losses of 097 per share in 2009 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “operating income loss” the 458 million increase in income from continuing operations compared to the prior year was due to a favorable variance related to timeshare strategyimpairment charges in 2009 752 million higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 116 million lower restructuring costs 51 million higher base management and franchise fees 73 million lower equity in losses 48 million higher incentive management fees 28 million higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 23 million and higher gains and other income 4 million these favorable variances were partially offset by higher income taxes 158 million higher general administrative and other expenses 58 million higher interest expense 62 million and lower interest income 6 million 

2009 compared to 2008 

compared to the prior year loss from continuing operations increased by 697 million 203 percent to a 2009 loss of 353 million from 2008 income of 344 million loss from continuing operations attributable to marriott increased by 705 million 196 percent to a 2009 loss of 346 million from 2008 income of 359 million and diluted losses per share from continuing operations attributable to marriott increased by 194 200 percent to 097 per share from earnings of 097 per share as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “operating income loss” the 697 million increase in loss from continuing operations compared to the prior year was due to 2009 timeshare strategyimpairment charges 752 million lower incentive management fees 157 million lower base management and franchise fees 156 million lower equity in earnings 81 million lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 69 million lower interest income 14 million lower gains and other income 7 million and lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 6 million lower income taxes 415 million lower general administrative and other expenses 81 million lower interest expense 45 million and lower restructuring costs 4 million partially offset the unfavorable variances 

earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda a financial measure which is not prescribed or authorized by united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” reflects earnings excluding the impact of interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization we consider ebitda to be an indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business we also use ebitda as do analysts lenders investors and others to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings accordingly the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies ebitda also excludes depreciation and 

  

amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 

we also evaluate adjusted ebitda another nongaap financial measure as an indicator of operating performance our adjusted ebitda excludes the 2008 and 2009 restructuring costs and other charges totaling 192 million and 213 million respectively the 2009 timeshare strategyimpairment charges totaling 752 million and for 2010 both impairment charges totaling 111 million and the 11 million reversal of a prior year impairment charge we evaluate adjusted ebitda that excludes these items to allow for periodoverperiod comparisons of our ongoing core operations before material charges ebitda and adjusted ebitda also facilitate our comparison of results from our ongoing operations before material charges with results from other lodging companies 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap both of these nongaap measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make in addition other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate it at all limiting adjusted ebitda’s usefulness as a comparative measure the table below shows our ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations and reconciles those measures with net income loss attributable to marriott 

 

   

business segments 

we are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging luxury lodging and timeshare see footnote no 17 “business segments” of the notes to our financial statements for further information on our segments including how we aggregate our individual brands into each segment and other information about each segment including revenues income loss from continuing operations attributable to marriott net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests equity in losses earnings of equity method investees assets and capital expenditures 

at yearend 2010 we operated or franchised the following properties by segment excluding 2043 corporate housing rental units associated with our execustay brand 

 

  

     

lodging reflects all five of our lodging segments 

2010 compared to 2009 

we added 154 properties 28114 rooms and 31 properties 6072 rooms exited the system in 2010 these figures do not include residential or execustay units we also added three residential properties 442 units and one residential property 25 units exited the system in 2010 

total segment financial results increased by 979 million to 983 million in 2010 from 4 million in 2009 and total segment revenues increased by 780 million to 11611 million in 2010 a 7 percent increase from revenues of 10831 million in 2009 

the yearoveryear increase in revenues included a 557 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to marriott the results compared to 2009 reflected a favorable variance from 685 million of 2009 timeshare strategyimpairment charges 614 million of which were reported in the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” caption and 71 million of which were reported in the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges nonoperating” caption of our income statements an increase of 116 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 19 million of decreased general administrative and other expenses a 73 million increase in base management and franchise fees to 1003 million in 2010 from 930 million in 2009 a 48 million decrease in restructuring costs 35 million of lower joint venture equity losses 28 million of higher incentive management fees to 182 million in 2010 from 154 million in 2009 an increase of 21 million in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses and a 21 million increase in gains and other income these favorable variances were partially offset by 55 million of increased interest expense and an 11 million decrease in net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest benefit for more detailed information regarding the variances see the preceding sections beginning with “operating income loss” 

in 2010 27 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 25 percent in 2009 in addition in 2010 65 percent of our incentive fees were derived from properties outside of the continental united states versus 67 percent in 2009 

see “statistics” below for detailed information on systemwide revpar and companyoperated revpar by segment region and brand 

compared to 2009 worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins in 2010 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit per available room “hppar” increased by 64 percent on a constant us dollar basis reflecting the impact of tight cost controls in 2010 at properties in our system and increased demand partially offset by decreased average daily rates north american companyoperated house profit margins were nearly unchanged as compared to 2009 while hppar at those same properties increased by 38 percent reflecting increased demand and tight cost controls at properties partially offset by decreased average daily rates and lower cancellation and attrition fees international companyoperated house profit margins increased by 120 basis points and hppar at those properties increased by 106 percent reflecting increased demand and continued tight propertylevel cost controls 

2009 compared to 2008 

we added 254 properties 37714 rooms and 17 properties 3476 rooms exited the system in 2009 these figures do not include residential or execustay units we also added five residential properties 568 units in 2009 

total segment financial results decreased by 1162 million 100 percent to 4 million in 2009 from 1166 million in 2008 and total segment revenues decreased by 1986 million to 10831 million in 2009 a 15 percent decrease from total segment revenues of 12817 million in 2008 as discussed in more detail earlier in this report demand was weaker in 2009 than 2008 

the decrease in revenues included a 1152 million decrease in cost reimbursements revenue which does not impact operating income or net income attributable to marriott the results compared to 2008 reflected 685 million of timeshare impairment charges 614 million of which were reported in the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” caption and 71 million of which we reported in the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges nonoperating” caption of our income statements see the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” section for more information on the impairments 157 million of lower incentive management fees a 156 million decrease in combined 2009 base management and franchise fees 85 million of owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 63 million of lower equity joint venture results 18 million of higher restructuring costs a 13 million decrease in net losses attributable to a noncontrolling interests benefit a decrease of 9 million in gains and other income and a decrease 

  

of 6 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by 30 million of decreased general administrative and other expenses these decreases included 80 million in other charges see footnote no 21 “restructuring costs and other charges” of the notes to the financial statements in our 2009 form 10k with 57 million recorded in general administrative and other expenses and 23 million recorded in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 

the 156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees reflected lower demand and significantly lower revpar in 2009 incentive management fees decreased by 157 million and reflected lower propertylevel operating revenues and margins associated with weak demand somewhat offset by propertylevel cost controls with lower propertylevel operating income many managed properties did not earn sufficient income to achieve owner priority returns and as a result we earned no incentive fees from those properties in 2009 67 percent of our incentive fees were derived from hotels outside north america versus 49 percent in 2008 

compared to 2008 worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins in 2009 decreased by 380 basis points and worldwide comparable companyoperated hppar decreased by 257 percent on a constant us dollar basis reflecting the impact of very tight cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system more than offset by the impact of yearoveryear revpar decreases international companyoperated house profit margins declined by 270 basis points and hppar at our international managed properties decreased by 220 percent reflecting significant cost control plans at properties more than offset by the impact of decreased demand north american companyoperated house profit margins declined by 440 basis points and hppar at our north american managed properties decreased by 277 percent also reflecting significant cost control plans at properties more than offset by the impact of decreased demand hppar at our north american limitedservice managed properties decreased by 287 percent reflecting cost control plans at properties more than offset by the impact of decreased demand  

lodging development 

we opened 154 properties totaling 28114 rooms across our brands in 2010 and 31 properties 6072 rooms left the system not including residential products or execustay we also added three residential properties 442 units and one residential property 25 units left the system highlights of the year included 

 

  

  

  

  

 we currently have nearly 105000 hotel rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 35000 hotel rooms gross to our system in 2011 

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report 

statistics 

the following tables show occupancy average daily rate and revpar for comparable properties for each of the brands in our north american fullservice and north american limitedservice segments for our international segment by region and the principal brand in our luxury segment the ritzcarlton we have not presented statistics for companyoperated fairfield inn  suites properties in these tables because the brand is predominantly franchised and we operate very few properties so such information would not be meaningful identified as “nm” in the tables that follow 

  

systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties 

the occupancy average daily rate and revpar statistics used throughout this report for 2010 include the 52 weeks from january 2 2010 through december 31 2010 for 2009 include the 52 weeks from january 3 2009 through january 1 2010 and for 2008 include the 53 weeks from december 29 2007 through january 2 2009 except in each case for the ritzcarlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental united states and canada which for them includes the period from january 1 through december 31 for each year 

  

 

 

        

  

         

  

     

 

 

        

  

         

  

   north american fullservice lodging includes marriott hotels  resorts  jw marriott  renaissance hotels  and autograph collection  

 

 2010 compared to 2009 

in 2010 across our north american fullservice lodging segment we added 20 properties 7591 rooms and 5 properties 1541 rooms left the system 

in 2010 revpar for comparable companyoperated north american fullservice properties increased by 43 percent to 10695 occupancy for these properties increased by 28 percentage points to 687 percent and average daily rates increased by 01 percent to 15560 

the 46 million increase in segment results compared to 2009 primarily reflected 21 million of higher base management and franchise fees 10 million of higher incentive management fees 7 million of lower general administrative and other expenses and 7 million of higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses 

the 21 million of higher base management and franchise fees primarily reflected increased revpar and unit growth as well as franchise fees from new properties added to the autograph collection the 10 million increase in incentive management fees was largely due to higher propertylevel revenue and continued tight propertylevel cost controls favorably impacting house profit margins 

the 7 million increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily due to stronger results driven by higher revpar and propertylevel margins 

the 7 million decrease in general administrative and other expenses primarily reflected favorable variances from an 8 million impairment charge related to the writeoff of contract acquisition costs for one property a 7 million charge for a security deposit both of which we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 and a 3 million reversal of a completion guarantee accrual because we satisfied the related guarantee release requirements in 2010 these favorable variances were partially offset by 7 million in net 2010 other cost increases primarily reflecting incentive compensation as well as a 4 million contract acquisition cost impairment charge recorded in the 2010 fourth quarter because we expect that a management agreement associated with one property will likely be terminated early in 2011 in conjunction with a change in property ownership 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with our north american fullservice lodging segment properties totaled 4575 million in 2010 compared to 4322 million in 2009 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

in 2009 across our north american fullservice lodging segment we added 11 properties 3645 rooms and 3 properties 800 rooms left the system 

in 2009 revpar for comparable companyoperated north american fullservice properties decreased by 170 percent to 10387 occupancy decreased by 43 percentage points to 661 percent and average daily rates decreased by 116 percent to 15710 

the 147 million decrease in segment results compared to 2008 primarily reflected a 71 million decrease in incentive management fees a 60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees a 15 million decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses and a 3 million increase in general administrative and other expenses partially offset by a 4 million increase in gains and other income 

the 71 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower propertylevel revenue and margins in 2009 compared to 2008 a result of weak demand partially offset by propertylevel cost controls fiftyone properties paid incentive fees in 2009 compared to 101 in 2008 the 60 million decrease in base management and franchise fees was primarily driven by lower revpar

marriott vacation club destinations timeshare program 

during our 2010 third quarter we launched the pointsbased marriott vacation club destinations timeshare program the “mvcd program” in north america and the caribbean under the mvcd program we sell beneficial interests in a domestic land trust based on the number of beneficial interests purchased mvcd members receive an annual allocation of vacation club points to redeem for travel at numerous destinations although the existing rights and privileges of owners of weeksbased intervals are unchanged those owners now also have the option of enrolling in the marriott vacation club destinations exchange program which affords them the opportunity to trade their weeksbased intervals for vacation club points usage each year as well as to purchase additional product in increments of less than one week since the mvcd program is a significant change from our prior approach to the timeshare business we have focused our marketing efforts on existing owners to encourage participation and purchase of additional product early results have exceeded our expectations 

we believe the mvcd program will appeal to a broader demographic than our prior weeksbased program by providing our owners with more flexible usage options including the use of points for tailored vacation experiences and by allowing us to sell our resort system at all locations including those where few or no weeks were still available we expect that the mvcd program will result in fewer resorts under construction at any given time and allow us to better leverage successful sales centers at completed resorts with less invested in inventory the mvcd program also should allow us to improve returns on investment 

revenue recognition for the mvcd program follows our timeshare pointsbased use system revenue recognition policy see footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to our financial statements the timing of revenue recognition for this program approximates contract sales because we expect to sell fully completed inventory for the foreseeable future with more efficient inventory management we expect to have lower unsold maintenance fee expense which should enhance profitability over time in addition to capitalized costs for internally developed software and licensing fees of 14 million we incurred costs for the mvcd program in 2010 of approximately 20 million which included 12 million of startup costs costs in excess of enrollment revenue for the new pointsbased program totaled 13 million and is reflected in our income statement in timeshare sales and service net of direct expenses 

given the amount of inventory we have we do not expect to develop new timeshare resorts in the near term 

proposed spinoff of timeshare operations and development business

discontinued operations 

synthetic fuel 

prior to 2008 we operated four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” because tax credits under irc section 45k were not available for coalbased synthetic fuels produced or sold after calendar year 2007 and because we estimated that high oil prices during 2007 would result in the phaseout of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007 we shut down the facilities in our 2007 fourth quarter and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel accordingly we now report this business as a discontinued operation see footnote no 3 “discontinued operations  synthetic fuel” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information regarding our former synthetic fuel segment

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage consisting of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we need to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility together with cash we expect to generate from operations and our ability to raise capital remains adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

at yearend 2010 our available borrowing capacity amounted to 2831 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of 2326 billion under our credit facility and our cash balance of 505 million we calculate that borrowing capacity by taking 2404 billion of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting 78 million of outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility during 2010 we repaid our outstanding credit facility borrowings and had no outstanding balance at yearend as noted in the previous paragraphs we anticipate that this available capacity will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we also expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly 

cash from operations 

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

 

 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 14 to 10 at yearend 2010 and 12 to 10 at yearend 2009 we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

  

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to our 2010 annual report on form 10k are as follows 

 

  

 timeshare cash flows in conjunction with our adoption of the new transfers of financial assets and consolidation standards in the 2010 first quarter as discussed in more detail in footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to our financial statements we no longer account for note receivable securitizations as sales but rather as secured borrowings as defined in the new standards and accordingly did not recognize gains or losses on the 2010 notes receivable securitization nor do we expect to recognize gains or losses on future note receivable securitizations as part of our adoption of the new standards we classify the following 2010 activities as “financing activities” in our consolidated statement of cash flows 1 payments on the newly recorded debt obligations as repayments of longterm debt 231 million 2 note repurchases classified in “timeshare activity net” under “operating activities” for 2009 and 2008 as repayments of longterm debt 93 million and 3 proceeds on any note securitizations as issuance of longterm debt 215 million classified in “timeshare activity net” under “operating activities” for 2009 and 2008 also we no longer have any cash flow activity related to residual interests or servicing assets we will continue to classify any collections on held notes receivable as well as the notes receivable we reestablished in the 2010 first quarter associated with past securitization transactions as “timeshare activity net” in “operating activities” 

in response to lower demand for our timeshare products we have correspondingly reduced our projected investment in new timeshare development while our timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments the following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare segment which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our timeshare segment in 2010 2009 and 2008 new timeshare segment mortgages were 256 million 302 million and 747 million respectively and collections totaled 347 million which included collections on securitized notes of 230 million 155 million and 222 million respectively 

 

 see footnote no 13 “longterm debt” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information on the failure of some timeshare securitized notes receivable pools to perform within established parameters and the resulting redirection of cash flows in 2010 seven securitized notes receivable pools reached performance triggers in different months throughout the year as a result of increased defaults as of yearend 2010 of the seven pools out of compliance during 2010 loan performance had improved sufficiently in six pools to cure the performance triggers leaving one pool out of compliance approximately 6 million of cash flows in 2010 and 17 million of cash flows in 2009 were redirected as a result of reaching the performance triggers for those years none of our pools experienced performance triggers in 2008 so no cash flow was redirected during that year 

on november 12 2010 we securitized a pool of approximately 229 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity the “20101 trust” simultaneous with the securitization investors purchased approximately 218 million in timeshare loan backed notes from the 20101 trust in a private placement in two classes class a notes totaling approximately 195 million with an interest rate of 354 percent and class b notes totaling approximately 23 million with an interest rate of 452 percent as consideration for our securitization of the timeshare mortgage loans we received cash proceeds of approximately 215 million net of costs and a subordinated residual interest in the 20101 trust through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time under the new transfers of financial assets and consolidation standards we accounted for this transaction as a secured borrowing in 2010 and we did not record a gain or loss 

  

on october 20 2010 we exercised our option for the term 2002 transaction to repurchase all outstanding collateral payoff and redeem all outstanding bonds and terminate the associated trust which resulted in cash outflows from the company of approximately 25 million 

on march 9 2009 we completed a private placement of approximately 205 million of floatingrate timeshare loan backed notes with a bankadministered commercial paper conduit we contributed approximately 284 million of notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the securitization of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products to a newly formed special purpose entity the “20091 trust” on the same day the 20091 trust issued approximately 205 million of the 20091 trust’s notes in connection with the private placement of notes receivable we received proceeds of approximately 181 million net of costs and retained 94 million of residual interests in the special purpose entity which included 81 million of notes we effectively owned after the transfer and 13 million related to the servicing assets and interest only strip we measured all residual interests at fair market value on the date of the transfer we recorded the notes that we effectively owned after the transfer as notes receivable in connection with this march 2009 note securitization we recorded a 1 million loss which we included in the “timeshare sales and services” line item in our income statement 

on october 21 2009 we securitized a pool of approximately 380 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity the “20092 trust” simultaneous with the securitization investors purchased 317 million of 4809 percent timeshare loan backed notes from the 20092 trust in a private placement as part of this transaction we paid off the notes that the 20091 trust issued in march 2009 and reacquired approximately 233 million of timeshare mortgage loans that were released from the 20091 trust we included approximately 218 million of these reacquired loans in the october 21 2009 securitization as consideration for our securitization of the timeshare mortgage loans we received cash proceeds of approximately 168 million and a subordinated residual interest in the 20092 trust through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time these cash proceeds are net of approximately 145 million paid to the commercial paper conduit to unwind the first quarter transaction in connection with this october 2009 note securitization we recorded a 38 million gain which we included in the “timeshare sales and services” line item in our income statement 

on june 10 2008 we securitized to a newly formed special purpose entity the “20081 trust” 300 million of notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products on the same day the 20081 trust issued 246 million of the 20081 trust’s notes in connection with the securitization of notes receivable we received net proceeds of 237 million we retained residual interests with a fair value on the day of sale of 93 million we recorded note securitization gains totaling 16 million in 2008 which was net of a 12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness which we included in the “timeshare sales and services” line item in our income statement 

we had residual interests of 214 million at yearend 2009 which we recorded in the accompanying balance sheet as other longterm receivables of 144 million and other current assets of 70 million our servicing assets and residual interests which we measured at yearend 2009 using level 3 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy which we described in our 2009 form 10k in footnote no 5 “fair value measurements” accounted for 91 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at yearend 2009 that were required to be measured at fair value using the then applicable fair value measurement guidance we treated the residual interests including servicing assets as trading securities under the provisions for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and accordingly we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the “timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our income statements during 2009 and 2008 we recorded trading gains of 18 million and losses of 9 million respectively see footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information on residual interests eliminated as part of the adoption of the new transfers of financial assets and consolidation standards in the first quarter of 2010 

for additional information on our timeshare note securitizations including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes see footnote no 12 “asset securitizations” of the notes to our financial statements see also footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” and footnote no 20 “variable interest entities” of the notes to our financial statements for the impact of adoption of the new transfers of financial assets and consolidation standards 

we estimate that for the 20year period from 2011 through 2030 the cash flow associated with completing all phases of our existing portfolio of owned timeshare properties will be approximately 28 billion this estimate is based on our current development plans which remain subject to change 

  

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 307 million in 2010 147 million in 2009 and 357 million in 2008 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives timeshare segment development expenditures which we include in “cash from operations” as noted in that section are not reflected in these numbers capital expenditures increased primarily due to our purchase of two hotel properties in 2010 over time we have sold lodging properties under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions we expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging and timeshare segments because 1 we own less than one percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 114 million in 2010 2 million in 2009 and 38 million in 2008 

loan activity from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise collections and sales for such loans net of advances during 2010 and 2009 amounted to net loan advances of 6 million in 2010 and net loan advances of 45 million in 2009 at yearend 2010 we had no senior loans and 191 million in mezzanine and other loans including a current portion of 7 million outstanding compared with 1 million in senior loans including a current portion of 1 million and 195 million in mezzanine and other loans including a current portion of 95 million outstanding at yearend 2009 in 2010 our notes receivable balance associated with senior mezzanine and other loans decreased by 4 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans see the “senior mezzanine and other loans” caption in footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to our financial statements for additional information 

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 29 million in 2010 28 million in 2009 and 25 million in 2008 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures 

cash from financing activities 

debt debt increased by 531 million in 2010 to 2829 million at yearend 2010 from 2298 million at yearend 2009 and reflected consolidation in conjunction with our adoption of the new transfers of financial assets and consolidation standards of debt with a balance at yearend 2010 of 1016 million partially offset by decreased borrowings under our credit facility of 425 million and other net debt decreases of 60 million debt decreased by 797 million in 2009 to 2298 million at yearend 2009 from 3095 million at yearend 2008 and reflected a 544 million decrease in borrowings under our credit facility the repayment upon maturity of 79 million including interest of series c senior notes in 2009 the repurchase of 119 million in book value 122 million in principal amount of senior notes across multiple series and other debt decreases of 57 million

 item 1 business tableend we are a worldwide operator and franchisor of hotels and related lodging facilities we were organized as a corporation in delaware in 1997 and became a public company in 1998 when we were “spun off” as a separate entity by the company formerly named “marriott international inc” our operations are grouped into the following five business segments

terms of our management agreements vary but typically we earn a management fee which comprises a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a percentage of annual revenues in excess of a fixed amount many of the operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners additionally many of our operating agreements permit the owners to terminate the agreement if certain performance metrics are not met and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies 

  

for lodging facilities that we operate we generally are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees required to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies both for which we generally are reimbursed by the owners we provide centralized reservation services and national advertising marketing and promotional services as well as various accounting and data processing services we are generally reimbursed by owners for the cost of providing these services 

franchised lodging properties 

we have franchising programs that permit the use of many of our lodging brand names and systems by other hotel owners and operators under these programs we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees which typically range from 4 percent to 6 percent of room revenues for all brands plus 2 percent to 3 percent of food and beverage revenues for certain fullservice hotels in addition franchisees contribute to our national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems at yearend 2009 we had 2279 franchised properties 304269 rooms

we also sell residential real estate in conjunction with luxury hotel development ritzcarltonresidential and timeshare segment projects ritzcarlton residences and grand residences by marriottresidential and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others residences developed in conjunction with hotels are typically constructed and sold by hotel owners with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk we typically open our timeshare segment residential projects over time with limited inventory available at any one time while the worldwide residential market is very large the luxurious nature of our residential properties the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands and the hospitality services that we provide all serve to make our residential properties distinctive 

seasonality 

in general business at companyoperated and franchised properties is relatively stable and includes only moderate seasonal fluctuations business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location

we operate 13 systemwide hotel reservation centers eight in the united states and canada and five in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others 

we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ® best rate guarantee gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our website or any other marriott reservation channel also key to our success is our strong marriott rewards loyalty program and our informationrich and easytouse wwwmarriottcom website our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective with almost 3500 hotels economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and enhance our fee revenue

building on more than 20 years of energy conservation experience we are committed to protecting the environment our “spirit to preserve ® ” environmental strategy calls for greening our 10 billion supply chain further reducing fuel and water consumption by 25 percent per available room creating green construction standards for hotel developers to achieve leed ® leadership in energy and environmental design certifications—an internationally recognized green building certification system designed by the us green building council educating and inspiring employees and guests to support the environment and helping protect the rainforest earlier in 2009 we invited guests to add to our 2 million commitment to help save the rainforest in brazil 

  

for new properties we have introduced a green hotel prototype that is in the process of being precertified leed compliant the green hotel prototype will save owners approximately 100000 and six months in design time and reduce a hotel’s energy and water consumption by up to 25 percent based on national averages these savings combined with incentives offered in many jurisdictions could provide a payback for the leed building investment in about two years the us travel association confirms that travelers place the importance of supporting environmentally responsible travel service suppliers as a necessity even in an economic downturn 

sales force one a sales deployment strategy that aligns sales efforts around customer needs reduces duplication of sales efforts and enables coverage for a larger number of accounts to support this strategy we continue to realign our sales organization to provide total account management for group business transient extendedstay and catering customers the rollout of sales force one which began in late 2007 is scheduled for completion by mid2011 the realigned sales organization is known as global sales which is made up of four components enterprise sales which is responsible for setting overall segment strategies and accountspecific strategies for large corporate and association customers area sales assigned to a designated geographical area and which is responsible for proactively selling a crossbrand portfolio property sales which is responsible for booking group and catering business that falls outside sales office parameters and the sales office which is responsible for evaluating and closing inbound leads developing new business and executing event planning for selectservice and extendedstay hotels 

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising there are approximately 852 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

in the current economic environment faced with significant reductions in demand we have taken steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency due to the competitive nature of our industry we have focused these efforts on areas that have limited or no impact on the guest experience while additional cost reductions may become necessary to preserve operating margins we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2009 approximately 69 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is concentrated with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have a 10 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than our direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

  

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties competitor hotels converting to one of marriott’s brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion 

the vacation ownership industry is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies since entering the timeshare industry in 1984 we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide competition in the timeshare interval fractional and residential business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts trust in the brand the pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits such as exchange programs we believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences combined with our financial strength diverse market presence strong brands and wellmaintained properties will enable us to remain competitive approximately 65 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales came from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners in 2009 as compared to 53 percent in 2008 the increase in 2009 reflected additional marketing and promotional efforts 

marriott rewards is our frequent guest program with over 32 million members and nine participating marriott brands the marriott rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 31 participating airline programs we believe that marriott rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2009 approximately 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by marriott rewards members in addition the ability of timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into marriott rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brands we continue to enhance our marriott rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically and strategically market to this large and growing customer base in 2009 the marriott rewards program eliminated blackout dates at nearly 2900 hotels worldwide giving marriott rewards members greater access to redemption nights at the company’s brands our loyal marriott rewards member base is a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts 

discontinued operations 

synthetic fuel 

our synthetic fuel operation consisted of four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” because tax credits under section 45k of the internal revenue code “irc” were not available for the production and sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar yearend 2007 we shut down the facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel in late 2007 accordingly we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation contemporaneously with the shutdown we transferred the facilities to the lessors of the sites where the facilities were located in exchange for the release of our obligations under the leases to restore the premises to their original conditions the book value of the facilities was zero at yearend 2007 as a result of the facilities being transferred to the lessors costs associated with shutting down the synthetic fuel operation and transferring the facilities to the site lessors were not material 

employee relations 

at yearend 2009 we had approximately 137000 employees approximately 7900 of whom were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

the properties we operate or develop are subject to national state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety the use management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials we believe that our operation of properties and our development of properties comply in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations our compliance with such provisions also has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position nor do we anticipate that such compliance will have a material impact in the future

 item 1a risk factors tableend forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the company and its financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

lodging and timeshare industry risks 

our industries are highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for customers we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas this could limit our operating margins diminish our market share and reduce our earnings 

we are subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel timeshare and corporate apartment industries the profitability of the hotels vacation timeshare resorts and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand or the prices our hotels are able to obtain for hotel rooms timeshare units residential units and corporate apartments or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profit of our lodging businesses reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans guarantees and noncontrolling equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage even where such factors do not reduce demand propertylevel profit margins may suffer if we are unable to fully recover increased operating costs from our guests similarly our fee revenue could be impacted by weak propertylevel revenue or profitability 

our hotel management and franchise agreements may also be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which the company fails or elects not to cure a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

current general economic conditions and the slowdown in the lodging and timeshare industries will continue to impact our financial results and growth the present weak economic conditions in the united states europe and much of the rest of the world and the uncertainty over the duration of that weakness and the prospects for recovery will continue to have a negative impact on the lodging and timeshare industries as a result of current economic conditions we continue to experience reduced demand for our hotel rooms and timeshare products accordingly our financial results have been impacted by the economic slowdown and we expect that our future financial results and growth will be further harmed until a meaningful recovery is well under way 

operational risks 

our lodging operations are subject to international national and regional conditions because we conduct our business on a national and international platform our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies in recent years our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from recent economic conditions the military action in iraq and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future economic performance is similarly affected by the economic environment in the united states and other regions which remains affected by the current worldwide economic weakness the resulting unknown pace of business travel and the occurrence of any future incidents in the countries where we operate 

the growing significance of our operations outside of the united states also makes us increasingly susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally which could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business we currently operate or franchise hotels and resorts in 68 countries our operations outside the united states represented approximately 16 percent of our revenues in 2009 and we expect that the international share of our total revenues will increase in future years as a result we are increasingly exposed to a number of challenges and risks associated with doing business outside the united states including those listed below any of which could reduce our revenues or profits increase our costs or disrupt our business 1 compliance with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments that may impact our operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls and trade restrictions 2 compliance with us laws that affect the activities of us companies abroad 3 limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a tax effective manner 4 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 5 uncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws and 6 rapid changes in government policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation 

  

new branded hotel products that we launch in the future may not be successful we may in the future launch additional branded hotel products we cannot assure that our recently launched edition and the autograph collection brands or new hotel products we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing the brands or that the brands will be successful in addition some of these new brands involve or may involve cooperation andor consultation with a third party including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties regarding areas of consultation or shared control could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters and the spread of contagious diseases such as h1n1 flu avian flu and sars in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers can cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty can have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

unresolved disputes with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise may result in litigation consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and will from time to time give rise to disagreements such disagreements may be more likely as hotel returns are depressed as a result of current economic conditions we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but are not always able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation and could do so in the future if any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment settlement or court order we could suffer significant losses our profits could be reduced or our future ability to operate our business could be constrained 

damage to or other potential losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of insurance coverage that we can obtain and our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

development and financing risks 

while w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties we depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and to develop timeshare properties and we or our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control ongoing instability in the financial markets following the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the contraction of available liquidity and leverage continue to constrain the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments as a result while lenders have shown a willingness to work with borrowers to extend relief in the short to medium term many current and prospective hotel owners are still finding new hotel financing on commercially viable terms to be challenging our ability to recover loan and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from owners through the proceeds of hotel sales refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital in addition any further downgrade of our credit ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch ratings or other rating agencies could reduce our availability of capital or increase our cost of capital 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our 

  

competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks we develop new hotel timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties as demonstrated by the 2009 impairment charges associated with our timeshare business our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to further decreases in demand for residential fractional or interval ownership increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for these projects that are not pursued to completion 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in the current difficult business environment 

other risks associated with timeshare and residential properties 

disruption in the credit markets could impair our ability to sell the loans that our timeshare business generates our timeshare business provides financing to purchasers of our timeshare and fractional properties and we periodically sell interests in those loans in the securities markets disruption in the credit markets in the second half of 2008 and much of 2009 impaired the timing and volume of the timeshare loans that we sell as well as the financial terms of such sales deteriorating market conditions resulted in the delay of a planned fourth quarter 2008 sale to the 2009 first quarter with terms that were less favorable to us than they had been historically and higher sales costs to us than we had originally anticipated market conditions improved throughout 2009 and we successfully completed a sale in the fourth quarter of 2009 on terms that were substantially more favorable than the first quarter 2009 transaction nonetheless financial markets have not returned to pre2008 conditions and another deterioration could delay future sales sharply increase their cost to us or prevent us from selling our timeshare notes entirely delays in note sales or increases in sale costs could cause us to reduce spending in order to maintain our leverage and return targets and could also result in increased borrowing to provide capital to replace proceeds from such sales 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties that are associated with our lodging and timeshare properties or brands may reduce our profits in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate through noncontrolling interests andor licensing fees in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including luxury residences and condominiums under our ritzcarlton and marriott brands such projects pose additional risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging and timeshare businesses which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 

 

   

  

 purchase defaults on the loans our timeshare business generates could reduce our timeshare revenues and profits we are also subject to the risk of default on the financing we provide to purchasers of our timeshare and fractional properties purchaser defaults could force us to foreclose on the loan and reclaim ownership of the financed property both for loans that we have not securitized and in our role as servicer for the loans we have sold in the securities markets if we cannot resell foreclosed properties in a timely manner or at a price sufficient to repay the loans and our costs we could incur losses impairment charges on loans we have yet to securitize or our residual interest in loans that we have securitized 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position the lodging and timeshare industries continue to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards program and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis if we are unable to do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our revenues some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s look no further ® best rate guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” from internet search engines such as google ®  bing ® and yahoo ® to steer customers toward their websites a practice currently being challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ websites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from wwwmarriottcom  or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels 

failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions damage of reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits  our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers as they are entered into processed by summarized by and reported by our various information systems and those of our service providers we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to us if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions our customers and employees also have a high expectation that their personal information will be adequately protected by ourselves or our service providers and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding in both the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data by us or by a service provider could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines and litigation 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the telemarketing sales rule canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing email and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products 

  

we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

other risks 

changes in tax and other laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and foreign laws regulations and policies in response to the recent economic crisis and the current recession we anticipate that many of the jurisdictions in which we do business will review tax and other revenue raising laws regulations and policies and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits in particular us and foreign governments may revise tax laws regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our nonus operations or that could require costly changes to those operations or the way in which they are structured for example most us company effective tax rates reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the united states is generally taxed at local rates which are often much lower than us tax rates if changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations were to significantly increase the tax rates on nonus income our effective tax rate could increase our profits could be reduced and if such increases were a result of our status as a us company could place us at a disadvantage to our nonus competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we are not able to recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director’s consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes in connection with mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder’s rights plan to replace the stockholder’s rights plan that expired in march 2008

the range of prices of our common stock and cash dividends declared per share for each quarterly period within the last two years are as follows 

 

  

 as discussed in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” weak economic conditions in much of the world instability in the financial markets and weak consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2009 we responded aggressively to the economic climate by reducing costs and lowering investment spending throughout the company and taking decisive measures to enhance our liquidity and manage our balance sheet accordingly our board of directors the “board” declared stock dividends rather than cash dividends in each of the 2009 second third and fourth quarters while the board again declared a cash dividend of 004 per share on february 4 2010 the board each quarter considers whether and in what form to declare a dividend 

at january 29 2010 there were 358522350 shares of class a common stock outstanding held by 44867 shareholders of record our class a common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange and the chicago stock exchange the fiscal yearend closing price for our stock was 2725 on december 31 2009 and 2006 on january 2 2009 all prices are reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend business and overview 

we are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3420 properties 595461 rooms and related facilities the figures in the preceding sentence are as of yearend 2009 and include 30 home and condominium products 3034 units for which we manage the related owners’ associations in addition we provided 2072 furnished corporate housing rental units which are not included in the totals 

our operations are grouped into five business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging luxury lodging and timeshare we operate develop and franchise under numerous separate brand names in 68 countries and territories 

we earn base incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease we also generate revenues from the following sources associated with our timeshare segment 1 selling timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties 2 operating the resorts and residential properties 3 financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals and 4 rentals finally we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate 

we sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a standalone basis under the ritzcarlton brand the ritzcarlton residences and in conjunction with timeshare segment projects the ritzcarlton destination club and grand residences by marriottresidential our timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time other residences are typically constructed and sold by thirdparty developers with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk while the worldwide residential market is very large the luxurious nature of our residential properties the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands and the hospitality services that we provide all serve to make our residential properties distinctive 

lodging 

weak economic conditions in the united states europe and much of the rest of the world instability in the financial markets following the worldwide financial crisis that began in 2008 and weak consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2009 lodging demand in the united states as well as internationally remained soft throughout 2009 as a result of weak economic conditions while hotel room supply increased in several markets demand for our luxury properties remained particularly weak outside the united states concerns in the latter half of 2009 regarding the h1n1 virus also hurt demand particularly in mexico as well as in some markets in asia the caribbean and south america 

we experienced continued weakness in 2009 associated with both group and business transient demand new group meeting cancellations moderated progressively throughout 2009 as compared to the 2008 fourth quarter new nearterm group bookings remain soft although they improved somewhat particularly in the 2009 fourth quarter while we continued to experience significant attrition rates in 2009 from expected attendance at meetings that moderated somewhat in the latter half of 2009 noncorporate demand which remained weak in the 2009 first quarter improved in the 2009 second quarter and even more so in the 2009 third and fourth quarters largely as a result of significant promotional efforts and discounting aimed at replacing weak corporate business with leisure government and other discounted transient business through these challenging times our strategy and focus continues to be to preserve profit margins by driving revenue increasing our market share and managing costs 

responding to the weak demand environment for hotel rooms we continue to deploy a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase both propertylevel revenue and market share we monitor market conditions continuously and are able to quickly institute high impact and low cost sales promotions as needed these promotions are designed both to reward and retain loyal customers and to attract new guests wwwmarriottcom and our loyal marriott rewards member base are both low cost and high impact vehicles for our revenue generation efforts in response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings we also implemented sales associate meeting planner and customer incentives to close on new group business 

as more customers use social media we have also found new ways to connect communicating with our customers on youtube twitter facebook and through our blog “marriott on the move” we also continue to enhance our marriott rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically and strategically market to this large and growing customer base with a goal of continuing to improve the overall guest service experience we improved wwwmarriottcom in 2009 by redesigning the website to significantly enhance its functionality and modernize its appearance 

  

properties in our system instituted and are maintaining very tight cost controls given the current weak demand environment we continue to work aggressively to reduce costs and enhance propertylevel house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours reviewing and adjusting room amenities relaxing some brand standards for hotels crosstraining personnel utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible eliminating certain positions and not filling some vacant positions we have also reduced aboveproperty costs which are allocated to hotels by scaling back systems processing and support areas in addition we have eliminated or not filled certain aboveproperty positions and have encouraged or where legally permitted required employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year 

our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels rather than owning them at yearend 2009 46 percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements 52 percent were operated under franchise agreements and 2 percent were owned or leased by us our emphasis on management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion reflecting properties added to our system generates ongoing growth with longterm management and franchise agreements this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry additionally we maintain financial flexibility by minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make 

we calculate revpar by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues references to revpar throughout this report are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted 

companyoperated house profit margin is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit also known as house profit to total propertylevel revenue we consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control gross operating profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

for our north american comparable companyoperated properties revpar decreased by 185 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting weakness in most markets our 2009 fiscal year began on january 3 2009 and included 52 weeks while the prior year included 53 weeks and two new year’s holidays if revpar for 2008 was calculated for the 52 week period ended january 2 2009 revpar would have declined by an average of 193 percent for our north american comparable companyoperated properties for our comparable managed properties outside north america revpar for 2009 decreased 180 percent versus 2008 with weakness in most markets around the world 

compared to 2008 worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins for 2009 decreased by 380 basis points reflecting the impact of revpar declines from weak demand partially offset by strong cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system 

timeshare 

weak economic conditions instability in the financial markets and low consumer confidence also kept demand for timeshare intervals soft in 2009 demand for fractional and residential units was particularly weak as a result we slowed or canceled some development projects and closed less efficient timeshare sales offices in 2008 and 2009 we also increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives and eliminated or did not fill certain positions in 2008 and 2009 during the 2009 second and third quarters we were able to increase sales over the 2009 first quarter through various sales promotions including pricing adjustments as with lodging our timeshare properties have instituted very tight cost controls and we have eliminated or not filled certain positions and have encouraged or where legally permitted required employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year for additional information on our companywide restructuring efforts see our “restructuring costs and other charges” caption later in this management’s discussion and analysis section 

in response to the difficult business conditions that the timeshare segment’s businesses continued to experience we evaluated our entire timeshare segment portfolio in the 2009 third quarter in order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time on september 22 2009 we approved plans for our timeshare segment to stimulate sales accelerate cash flow and reduce investment spending these decisions resulted in our recording 2009 third quarter pretax charges totaling 752 million 502 million aftertax we discuss these charges in more detail under the caption “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” later in this management’s discussion and analysis section 

  

since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentageofcompletion accounting method soft demand frequently is not reflected in our timeshare segment results until later accounting periods intentional and unintentional construction delays could also reduce nearerterm timeshare segment results as percentageofcompletion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well 

our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction the worldwide presence and quality of our brands our marriott rewards loyalty program an informationrich and easytouse website a multichannel central reservations system and desirable property amenities we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary website wwwmarriottcom  through functionality and service improvements and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of propertylevel reservations via this costefficient channel we have added other languages to wwwmarriottcom  and we have enabled guests to use handheld devices to make and confirm reservations and get directions

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2009 2008 and 2007 

continuing operations 

revenues 

2009 compared to 2008 

revenues decreased by 1971 million 15 percent to 10908 million in 2009 from 12879 million in 2008 as a result of lower cost reimbursements revenue 1152 million timeshare sales and service revenue 300 million owned leased corporate housing and other revenue 206 million incentive management fees 157 million comprised of 108 million for north america and 49 million outside of north america base management fees 105 million comprised of 79 million for north america and 26 million outside of north america and franchise fees 51 million 

the decrease in cost reimbursements revenue to 7682 million in 2009 from 8834 million in 2008 reflected lower propertylevel costs in response to lower occupancy and cost controls partially offset by the impact of growth across the system this revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income we added 35 managed properties 8574 rooms and 200 franchised properties 25136 rooms to our system in 2009 net of properties exiting the system 

the decrease in timeshare sales and services revenue of 300 million 21 percent to 1123 million in 2009 from 1423 million in 2008 primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent residential products and the asia pacific points program as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009 and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue the decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to the 2008 fiscal year and higher financing revenue see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our timeshare segment 

the decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue to 1019 million in 2009 from 1225 million in 2008 largely reflected 183 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties 19 million of lower revenue associated with our corporate housing business 14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees and 5 million of lower branding fees associated with the sale of residential real estate partially offset by 11 million of increased branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and a 3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008 and as a result was not operating at full capacity combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled 70 million and 64 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected revpar declines associated with weak lodging demand 

the decrease in incentive management fees to 154 million in 2009 from 311 million in 2008 reflected lower propertylevel revenue associated with weak demand lower revpar and the associated lower propertylevel operating income and margins in 2009 compared to 2008 most incentive management fees are earned only after each hotel earns a minimum return for the hotel’s owner with particularly weak demand and low propertylevel operating income in 2009 most managed hotels did not have sufficient operating income to allow us to earn an incentive fee in 2009 only 25 percent of managed hotels paid incentive fees to us as compared to 56 percent in 2008 the decreases in base management fees to 530 million in 2009 from 635 million in 2008 and franchise fees to 400 million in 2009 from 451 million in 2008 both reflected revpar declines driven by weaker demand partially offset by the favorable impact of unit growth across the system 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

revenues decreased by 111 million 1 percent to 12879 million in 2008 from 12990 million in 2007 primarily as a result of lower timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system base management and franchise fees increased by 27 million as a result of improved revpar in international markets and unit growth partially offset by the impact of declines in north american revpar the 27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling 6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and 13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008 incentive management fees decreased by 58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of 1 incentive management fees totaling 17 million that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2007 and 2 13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with hurricane katrina the decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower propertylevel profitability due to lower occupancy and higher propertylevel wages and benefits costs and utilities costs particularly in north america partially offsetting the decreases incentive management fees from international properties increased reflecting revpar and unit growth see the “business segments” discussion later in this report for additional information 

the 15 million 1 percent decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue largely reflected 10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties 17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the receipt in 2008 of 15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees compared to 19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate totaling 64 million in both 2008 and 2007 partially offset by 17 million of higher corporate housing revenue the 10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels 

timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by 324 million 19 percent compared to the prior year the decrease primarily reflected lower demand in 2008 revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008 as well as a decrease of 65 million in note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the asia pacific points program increased interest income revenue associated with projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007 and increased services revenue see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our timeshare segment 

the 111 million decrease in total revenue includes 259 million 3 percent of increased cost reimbursements revenue to 8834 million in 2008 from 8575 million in the prior year the increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage we added six managed properties 3100 rooms and 157 franchised properties 19836 rooms to our system in 2008 net of properties exiting the system 

timeshare strategyimpairment charges 

in response to the difficult business conditions that the timeshare segment’s timeshare luxury residential and luxury fractional real estate development businesses continued to experience we evaluated our entire timeshare portfolio in the 2009 third quarter in order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time on september 22 2009 we approved plans for our timeshare segment to take the following actions 1 for our luxury residential projects reduce prices convert certain proposed projects to other uses sell some undeveloped land and not pursue further marriottfunded residential development projects 2 reduce prices for existing luxury fractional units 3 continue shortterm promotions for our us timeshare business and defer the introduction of new projects and development phases and 4 for our european timeshare and fractional resorts continue promotional pricing and marketing incentives and not pursue further development we designed these plans which primarily relate to luxury residential and fractional resorts to stimulate sales accelerate cash flow and reduce investment spending 

as a result of these decisions in 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling 752 million in our consolidated statements of income 502 million aftertax including 614 million of pretax charges impacting operating income under the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” caption and 138 million of pretax charges impacting nonoperating income under the “timeshare strategyimpairment charges nonoperating” caption the 752 million of pretax impairment charges were noncash other than 27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and 21 million of charges for purchase commitments that we expected to fund in 2010 

  

the following table details the composition of these charges 

 

 for additional information related to these impairment charges including how these impairments were determined and the impairment charges grouped by product type andor geographic location see footnote no 20 “timeshare strategy – impairment charges” 

restructuring costs and other charges 

during the latter part of 2008 we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result in part of the failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy our capital intensive timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008 although we did complete a note sale in the first quarter of 2009 these declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees cancellation of development projects reduced timeshare contract sales and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans in the fourth quarter of 2008 we put certain companywide costsaving measures in place in response to these declines with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further costsaving measures upperlevel management responsible for the timeshare segment lodging development and aboveproperty level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives the various initiatives resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of 55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 we also recorded 137 million of other charges in the 2008 fourth quarter for information regarding the fourth quarter 2008 charges see footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our annual report on form 10k for 2008 “2008 form 10k” 

restructuring costs 

as part of the restructuring actions we began in the fourth quarter of 2008 we initiated further cost savings measures in 2009 associated with our timeshare segment hotel development aboveproperty level management and corporate overhead these further measures resulted in additional restructuring costs of 51 million in 2009 for additional information on these restructuring costs including the types of restructuring costs incurred in total and by segment a roll forward of the restructuring liability and cumulative restructuring costs to date since inception of the restructuring please see footnote no 21 “restructuring costs and other charges” 

as a result of our timeshare segment’s restructuring efforts we are projecting 112 million to 117 million 68 million to 72 million aftertax of annual cost savings in 2010 in 2009 we realized approximately 80 million to 85 million 48 million to 52 million aftertax compared to the 70 million to 80 million we had projected for 2009 the 2009 savings primarily were and we expect that future savings will primarily be reflected in the “timesharedirect” and the “general administrative and other” expense captions in our consolidated statements of income 

as a result of the hotel development restructuring efforts across several of our lodging segments we are projecting approximately 12 million 7 million aftertax of annual cost savings in 2010 in 2009 we realized 9 million 5 million aftertax of savings the 2009 savings primarily were and we expect that future savings will primarily be reflected in the “general administrative and other” expense caption in our consolidated statements of income 

the restructuring initiatives we implemented by reducing above propertylevel lodging management personnel and corporate overhead are projected to result in 10 million to 11 million 6 million to 7 million aftertax of annual cost savings in 2010 and in 2009 we realized all of the 8 million 5 million aftertax of savings we had projected for 2009 these savings primarily were and are expected to be reflected in the “general administrative and other” expense caption in our consolidated statements of income 

  

we anticipate that the remaining restructuring liability related to the workforce reduction will be substantially paid by the third quarter of 2010 for the timeshare segment and by the fourth quarter of 2010 for hotel development and for aboveproperty level management the amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities in the timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2014 the remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by yearend 2010

operating income 

2009 compared to 2008 

operating income decreased by 917 million 120 percent to an operating loss of 152 million in 2009 from operating income of 765 million in 2008 the decrease in operating income reflected timeshare strategyimpairment charges in 2009 of 614 million 157 million of lower incentive management fees a 156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees 69 million of lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 6 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by an 81 million decrease in general administrative and other expenses and a decrease in restructuring costs of 4 million in the preceding “revenues” section we note the reasons for the decrease of 157 million in incentive management fees as well as the decrease of 156 million in combined base management and franchise fees as compared to 2008 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses in 2009 totaled 83 million the decline of 6 million 7 percent from 89 million in 2008 primarily reflected 50 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 17 million of lower services revenue net of expenses mostly offset by 43 million of higher financing revenue net of financing expenses 15 million of higher other revenue net of expenses and 3 million of higher reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses lower development revenue net of product marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower revenue for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent lower revenue net of costs for our asia pacific points program and a 10 million charge related to an issue with a state tax authority partially offset by favorable reportability for several projects that reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds after 2008 and favorable variances from both a 22 million 2008 pretax impairment charge related to a joint venture that we fully consolidate 10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit and a 9 million 2008 inventory writedown related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in europe higher financing revenue net of financing expenses reflected higher note sale gains increased residual interest accretion a decrease in the adjustment to the fair market value of residual interests and a decrease in the cost of financing partially offset by lower interest income lower services revenue net of expenses reflected weak demand for rentals and increased maintenance cost for unsold inventory see “business segments timeshare” later in this section for additional information regarding our timeshare segment 

the 69 million 50 percent decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was primarily attributable to a decline of 65 million in revenue net of expenses primarily associated with weaker demand at owned and leased properties as well as our corporate housing business 14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees and 5 million of lower branding fees associated with sale of residential real estate partially offset by 11 million of increased branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and a 3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008 and as a result was not operating at full capacity 

general administrative and other expenses decreased by 81 million 10 percent to 722 million in 2009 from 803 million in 2008 the decrease primarily reflected 186 million of lower expenses largely due to cost savings generated from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2008 and lower incentive compensation as well as a 12 million favorable variance due to development cancellations in 2008 additionally in 2009 we reached final settlement regarding the delta airlines lease investment and recorded a 3 million recovery of the investment previously reserved in the “general administrative and other” expense caption on our consolidated statements of income for additional 

  

information regarding the delta airlines lease investment see the “investment in leveraged lease” caption in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our 2008 form 10k these benefits were partially offset by the following items 49 million of impairment charges for two security deposits that we deemed unrecoverable in 2009 due in part to our decision not to fund certain cash flow shortfalls partially offset by a 15 million accrual in 2008 for the expected funding of those cash flow shortfalls and an 11 million reversal in 2009 of the remaining balance of that 2008 accrual due to the decision to no longer fund those cash flow shortfalls 2009 provisions for loan losses of 43 million for two loans partially offset by a 22 million favorable variance from a 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan as discussed in footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” these provisions for loan losses are now part of “general administrative and other” an 8 million impairment charge related to the writeoff of contract acquisition costs for one property a 7 million writeoff of timeshare segment capitalized software costs 12 million of expenses primarily related to writeoffs of other assets that we deemed nonrecoverable performance cure accruals and guarantee accruals associated with 12 hotels and 4 million of bad debt expense on an accounts receivable balance additionally 2009 included a 15 million unfavorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses compared to a 28 million favorable impact in 2008 both of which reflected marktomarket valuations of the 81 million decrease in total general administrative and other expenses 1 million increase was attributable to our lodging segments 31 million decrease was attributable to our timeshare segment and 51 million decrease was unallocated 

2008 compared to 2007 

operating income decreased by 418 million 35 percent to 765 million in 2008 from 1183 million in 2007 the decrease in operating income reflected 261 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 41 million of lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 58 million of lower incentive management fees 55 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008 and a 30 million increase in general administrative and other expenses partially offset by an increase in combined base management and franchise fees of 27 million 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses for 2008 totaled 89 million the decline of 261 million 75 percent from the prior year primarily reflected 138 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs 95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses 34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses partially offset by 4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses and 2 million of lower joint venture related expenses lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval fractional and residential products lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008 a 22 million pretax impairment charge 10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit startup costs and low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition thresholds as well as lower revenue recognition for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 the decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information regarding our timeshare segment 

the 41 million 23 percent decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 21 million of lower income reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties 4 million of lower termination fees and 17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year partially offsetting the decreases were lower depreciation charges totaling 6 million in 2008 associated with one property compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2007 of 8 million associated with that same property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 30 million 4 percent to 803 million in 2008 from 773 million in 2007 this increase reflected the following items 44 million of increased expenses associated with among other things our unit growth and development systems improvements and initiatives to enhance our brands globally a 16 million charge for certain guarantees an unfavorable 9 million variance for reserve reversals in 2007 12 million in writeoffs in 2008 of costs related to development cancellations 4 million of increased foreign exchange losses 4 million of charges related to bad debt reserves on accounts receivable and a 15 million increase in provision for loan losses reflecting a 22 million 2008 provision on a fully impaired loan see the “other charges” section of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our 2008 form 10k for more information and a 3 million loan loss provision associated with one property partially offset by favorable variances associated with a 5 million provision recorded in 2007 to write off the remaining exposure associated with our investment in a delta airlines lease and the reversal of 5 million of provisions in 2008 related to two previously impaired loans that were repaid as discussed in footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” those provisions for loan losses are now part of “general administrative and other” see “other charges” section of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our 2008 form 10k for additional information on the charge related to certain guarantees development cancellation writeoffs bad debt reserves and provision for loan losses these unfavorable variances were partially offset by a favorable variance related to a 2007 charge of 35 million resulting from excise taxes associated with the settlement of 

  

issues raised during the examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and department of labor of our employee stock ownership plan “esop” feature of our employees’ profit sharing retirement and savings plan and trust the “plan” see footnote no 2 “income taxes” in our 2008 form 10k for additional information on the esop settlement additionally 2008 included a 28 million favorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses compared to an 11 million unfavorable impact in the prior year both of which reflected marktomarket valuations of the 30 million increase in total general administrative and other expenses an increase of 38 million was attributable to our lodging segments an increase of 13 million was attributable to our timeshare segment and a decrease of 21 million primarily reflecting the 2007 esop settlement charge was unallocated 

the reasons for the decrease of 58 million in incentive management fees as well as the combined base management and franchise fees increase of 27 million over the prior year are noted in the preceding “revenues” section 

gains and other income expense 

the table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 2009 compared to 2008 

the 21 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2009 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of senior notes we repurchased during the period for additional information on the debt extinguishment see the “liquidity and capital resources” section later in this report the 5 million impairment of equity securities in 2009 reflected an otherthantemporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities for additional information on the impairment see footnote no 5 “fair value measurements” 

2008 compared to 2007 

the 28 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2008 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of our senior notes we repurchased for additional information on the debt extinguishment see the “liquidity and capital resources” section later in this report the 25 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected a 23 million gain associated with sales of real estate in our international segment as well as other smaller gains on sale of real estate in 2007 that did not occur in 2008 the 12 million gain on forgiveness of debt in 2007 was associated with government incentives noted in the “2007 compared to 2006” section in our 2008 form 10k gain on sale of joint venture and other investments of 31 million in 2007 reflected an 18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling 13 million on the sale of joint venture investments income from cost method joint ventures decreased 17 million to a loss of 3 million in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to certain cost method tax investments that we deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired see the “other charges” section of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our 2008 form 10k for more information 

interest expense 

2009 compared to 2008 

interest expense decreased by 45 million 28 percent to 118 million in 2009 compared to 163 million in 2008 interest expense associated with commercial paper and our 24 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility our “credit facility” decreased by 25 million reflecting the repayment of our commercial paper in 2008 and increased borrowings under the credit facility with a lower interest rate we also benefited from a 26 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners including our marriott rewards gift certificates and selfinsurance programs as a result of lower interest rates and the repurchase of some of our senior notes across multiple series in the 2008 fourth quarter and 2009 first quarter see “liquidity and capital resources” later in this section for additional information which resulted in a 12 million reduction to interest expense and finally other interest expense decreases of 5 million these decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a 23 million unfavorable variance to 2008 as a result of lower capitalized interest in 2009 associated with construction projects 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

interest expense decreased by 21 million 11 percent to 163 million in 2008 compared to 184 million in 2007 the decrease in interest expense compared to the prior year reflected a charge of 13 million for interest on the excise taxes associated with the esop settlement in 2007 interest expense associated with commercial paper and our credit facility decreased in 2008 reflecting a reduction in the amount of commercial paper outstanding lower interest rates on commercial paper and increased borrowings under the credit facility with a lower interest rate as a result yearoveryear interest expense was lower by 7 million we also benefited from a 15 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners as a result of lower interest rates a 6 million favorable variance to the prior year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects and the maturity of our series e senior notes in early 2008 yielding a 6 million favorable variance to the prior year the writeoff of 2 million of deferred financing costs in 2007 related to the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement resulted in a favorable variance in 2008 these favorable variances to the prior year were partially offset by the impact of the series i and series j senior notes issuances which occurred in the second half of 2007 that increased our interest expense in 2008 by 30 million 

interest income and income tax 

2009 compared to 2008 

interest income decreased by 14 million 36 percent to 25 million in 2009 from 39 million in 2008 primarily reflecting 8 million of interest income we recorded in 2008 for three loans that subsequently became impaired because we recognize interest on impaired loans on a cash basis we did not recognize any interest on these impaired loans in 2009 the decline in interest income also reflected 5 million of lower interest income due to a decline in interest rates on our cash balances 2 million of previously reserved interest income collected in 2008 and 2 million of lower interest income in 2009 reflecting a reduction in principal due associated with one loan partially offset by 4 million of additional interest income from new loans funded at yearend 2008 and in 2009 

as noted earlier in the “operating income” discussion we now classify the 2009 and 2008 provisions for loan losses as “general administrative and other” expenses in our consolidated statements of income 

our tax provision decreased by 415 million 119 percent to a benefit of 65 million in 2009 from a provision of 350 million in 2008 reflecting a pretax loss in 2009 and 43 million of lower tax expense associated with our deferred compensation plan the decrease was partially offset by an increase to the effective tax rate in 2009 due to a change in our mix of worldwide income resulting from substantial reductions of foreign income in jurisdictions with low tax rates the 2009 tax rate also reflected 52 million of income tax expense primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries an issue that is the subject of ongoing discussions between us and the irs the charges recorded in 2009 primarily relate to our ongoing current fiscal year exposure related to this issue in addition to tax expense on pretax earnings tax expense for 2008 also reflected 1 29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable us court of federal claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction 2 19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments including a settlement with the irs that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction and 3 24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries 

2008 compared to 2007 

interest income increased by 1 million 3 percent to 39 million from 38 million in the prior year 

as noted earlier in the “operating income” discussion and later in footnote no 1 “significant accounting policies” we now classify the 2008 provision for loan losses and 5 million of the 17 million 2007 provision for loan losses as “general administrative and other” expenses in our consolidated statements of income we also now classify the remaining 12 million of the 2007 provision for loan losses as “equity in losses earnings” in our consolidated statements of income as discussed under that caption later in this section 

our tax provision decreased by 91 million 21 percent to 350 million in 2008 from a tax provision of 441 million in 2007 and reflected the impact associated with lower pretax income in 2008 a 2007 charge for a german legislative tax change and 6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the esop settlement this decrease was partially offset by 39 million in higher deferred compensation costs in 2008 and a higher tax rate in 2008 the higher 2008 tax rate reflected 1 29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable us court of federal claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction 2 19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments including a settlement with the irs that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction and 3 24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries 

  

equity in losses earnings 

2009 compared to 2008 

equity in losses of 66 million in 2009 increased by 81 million from equity in earnings of 15 million in 2008 and primarily reflected a 30 million impairment charge in 2009 associated with a luxury segment joint venture investment that we determined to be fully impaired see the “other charges” caption in the “restructuring costs and other charges” section for more information the decrease in joint venture equity earnings also reflected an unfavorable comparison to 15 million of equity earnings in 2008 from a joint venture that sold portfolio assets and had significant associated gains and 5 million of earnings in 2008 from another joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture further contributing to the decline were 24 million of decreased earnings in 2009 for a timeshare segment joint venture residential and fractional project 7 million of equity losses associated with a north american limitedservice segment joint venture a 3 million impairment and 2 million of other equity losses associated with an international segment joint venture and 9 million of equity losses at certain other joint ventures all of which were negatively affected by the weak demand environment the unfavorable impacts also included a 3 million impairment charge for a joint venture that is not allocated to one of our segments and for which we do not expect to recover our investment these decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable 11 million impact in 2008 associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate and a 2008 impairment charge of 9 million associated with one luxury segment joint venture under development see the “other charges” section of footnote no 21 “restructuring costs and other charges” for more information on some of these joint venture impairments 

2008 compared to 2007 

equity in earnings of 15 million in 2008 decreased 12 million from earnings of 3 million in 2007 and primarily reflected 14 million of increased earnings from a joint venture which sold portfolio assets in 2008 and had significant associated gains 10 million of favorable variances for three joint ventures that experienced losses due to startup costs in the prior year and 5 million of increased earnings from an international segment joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture in 2008 partially offset by an unfavorable 11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate an impairment charge of 9 million associated with one luxury segment joint venture under development and a 7 million impact related to contract cancellation allowances recorded at one timeshare segment joint venture see the “other charges” section of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our 2008 form 10k for more information on the impairment and contract cancellation allowances in 2007 we also recorded a 12 million loan loss provision related to one property where we have a joint venture investment that is not allocated to one of our segments which as discussed in footnote no 1 “significant accounting policies” we now classify under the “equity in losses earnings” caption in our consolidated statements of income 

net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests 

2009 compared to 2008 

net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 8 million in 2009 to 7 million compared to 15 million in 2008 the benefit for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 of 7 million are net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling 11 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of 4 million associated with the losses 

2008 compared to 2007 

net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 14 million in 2008 to 15 million the benefits for net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2008 of 15 million are net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling 24 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of 9 million associated with the losses

we added 254 properties 37714 rooms and 17 properties 3476 rooms exited the system in 2009 not including residential products we also added 5 residential properties 568 units in 2009

the 156 million decrease in combined base management and franchise fees reflected lower demand and significantly lower revpar in 2009 incentive management fees decreased by 157 million and reflected lower propertylevel operating revenues and margins associated with weak demand somewhat offset by propertylevel cost controls with lower propertylevel operating income many managed properties did not earn sufficient income to achieve owner priority returns and as a result we earned no incentive fees from those properties in 2009 67 percent of our incentive fees were derived from hotels outside north america versus 49 percent in 2008 

systemwide revpar which includes data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties for comparable north american properties decreased by 172 percent and revpar for our comparable north american companyoperated properties decreased by 185 percent

lodging development 

we opened 254 properties totaling 37714 rooms across our brands in 2009 and 17 properties 3476 rooms left the system not including residential products we also added 5 residential properties 568 units highlights of the year included 

 

  

  

  

 we currently have approximately 100000 hotel rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add 25000 to 30000 hotel rooms gross to our system in 2010 

  

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report 

statistics 

the following tables show occupancy average daily rate and revpar for comparable properties for each of the brands in our north american fullservice and north american limitedservice segments for our international segment by region and the principal brand in our luxury segment the ritzcarlton we have not presented statistics for companyoperated fairfield inn  suites properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties as the brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful identified as “nm” in the tables that follow systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties 

the occupancy average daily rate and revpar statistics used throughout this report for 2009 include the 52 weeks from january 3 2009 through january 1 2010 for 2008 include the 53 weeks from december 29 2007 through january 2 2009 and for 2007 include the 52 weeks from december 30 2006 through december 28 2007 except in each case for the ritzcarlton brand properties and properties located outside of the continental united states and canada which for them includes the period from january 1 through december 31 for each year

the decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses of 25 million primarily reflected an unfavorable 7 million impact associated with two properties undergoing renovations in 2008 8 million of losses associated with three properties one of which was a new property that opened in 2008 5 million of lower contract termination fees received 2 million of lower land rent income and an unfavorable 3 million impact associated with one property that was sold in 2007 and is now a managed property

the 315 million decrease in timeshare segment revenues to 1750 million from 2065 million reflected a 324 million decrease in timeshare sales and services revenue and a 1 million decrease in base management fees partially offset by a 10 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue the decrease in timeshare sales and services revenue compared to the prior year primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval fractional and residential projects lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2008 a decrease of 65 million in note sale gains in 2008 a 32 million impact from the reduced valuation of residual interests contract cancellation allowances of 17 million low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds as well as the recognition in 2007 of revenues received in prior years for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 partially offsetting the decrease was higher revenue associated with the asia pacific points program revenue that became reportable subsequent to the 2007 fiscal year and increased services revenue timeshare segment revenues for 2008 and 2007 included 68 million and 50 million respectively of interest income and note sale gains of 16 million and 81 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively 

segment results of 28 million in 2008 decreased by 278 million from 306 million in 2007 and reflected 261 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 28 million of restructuring costs and 13 million of higher general administrative and other expenses partially offset by 24 million of higher net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests and 1 million in higher joint venture equity earnings 

the 261 million decrease in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 138 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs 95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses 34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses partially offset by 4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses and 2 million of lower joint venture related expenses lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval fractional and residential projects increased marketing and sales costs lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008 startup costs in 2008 for newer projects low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition reportability thresholds revenue recognition for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds a 9 million impact from inventory writedowns related to the termination of certain phases of timeshare development in europe and a 5 million net impact from contract cancellation allowances see the “other charges” caption of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our 2008 form 10k for additional information in addition development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected an impairment charge we recorded a pretax charge of 22 million 10 million net of noncontrolling interest benefit in the 2008 third quarter within the “timesharedirect” caption of our consolidated statements of income related to the impairment of a fractional and whole ownership real estate project held for development by a joint venture that we consolidate we made the adjustment in accordance with the guidance for accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets to adjust the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated fair value at yearend 2008 the predominant items we considered in our analysis were the downturn in market conditions including contract cancellations and tightening in the credit markets especially for jumbo mortgage loans we estimated the fair value of the inventory utilizing a probability weighted cash flow model that reflected our expectations of future performance discounted at a 10 year riskfree interest rate determined from the yield curve for us treasury instruments 368 percent the 25 million noncontrolling interests benefit reflected our joint venture partner’s portion of the losses of subsidiaries that we consolidate the 25 million noncontrolling interests benefit also reflected the impact of the pretax benefit of 12 million in 2008 representing our joint venture partner’s pretax share of the 22 million impairment charge 

the 95 million decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected 65 million of lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to 2007 mostly attributable to higher note sale volumes in 2007 42 million of lower residual interest accretion and 6 million of increased financing costs partially offset by 18 million of increased interest income lower note sale gains of 65 million reflected a 12 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to hedge ineffectiveness on note sale hedges and the 42 million of lower residual interest accretion reflected a 32 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which future cash flows were discounted to estimate the fair market value see the “other charges” caption of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our 2008 form 10k for more information regarding these charges in 2008 and 2007 we sold notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of 300 million and 520 million respectively the 34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses represented increased marketing and selling costs coupled with increased product cost relative to prior year 

  

the 28 million of restructuring costs represented 14 million in severance costs 9 million in development cancellations and 5 million in facility exit costs incurred as a result of restructuring initiatives at the segment see footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our 2008 form 10k for more information related to these initiatives and the costs incurred the 13 million increase in general administrative and other expenses reflected increased costs associated with wages and benefits joint venture equity earnings increased 1 million and reflected 10 million of startup losses incurred in 2007 for three joint ventures mostly offset by 7 million of contract cancellation allowances recorded at one joint venture in 2008 see the “other charges” caption of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” in our 2008 form 10k for additional information and 3 million of lower earnings in 2008 at one joint venture 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with timeshare segment properties totaled 285 million in 2008 compared to 275 million in 2007 

discontinued operations 

synthetic fuel 

the tax credits provided under irc section 45k were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through december 31 2007 given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phaseout of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007 we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on november 3 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation see footnote no 3 “discontinued operationssynthetic fuel” in this report for additional information regarding the synthetic fuel segment 

2008 compared to 2007 

the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 1 million in 2008 and 352 million in 2007 income from the synthetic fuel segment totaled 3 million net of tax in 2008 compared to a loss of 1 million in 2007 income from the synthetic fuel segment of 3 million for 2008 primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination by the secretary of the treasury in 2008 of the reference price of a barrel of oil for 2007 partially offset by payments due to third parties based on the amount of additional tax credits 

sharebased compensation 

under our 2002 comprehensive stock and cash incentive plan we award 1 stock options to purchase our class a common stock “stock option program” 2 stock appreciation rights “sars” 3 restricted stock units of our class a common stock and 4 deferred stock units we grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant 

during 2009 we granted 08 million restricted stock units and 05 million employee sars 5600 nonemployee sars and 39000 deferred stock units see footnote no 4 “sharebased compensation” later in this report for additional information 

new accounting standards 

see footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” for information on both 1 our adoption of new accounting standards in 2009 none of which had a material impact on our financial statements and 2 our first quarter of 2010 adoption of the following recently issued accounting standards and the estimated initial impact of those adoptions on our financial statements financial accounting standards “fas” no 166 “accounting for transfers of financial assetsan amendment of financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement no 140” or accounting standards update no 200916 “transfers and servicing topic 860 accounting for transfers of financial assets” and fas no 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” or accounting standards update no 200917 “consolidations topic 810 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities” the impact of adopting these recently issued accounting standards could in subsequent periods also prevent us from meeting the derecognition criteria of asc 860 and accordingly prevent us from achieving sale accounting for future securitization transactions because the underlying securitization vehicles may require consolidation 

we estimate that if we had adopted the aforementioned new accounting standards as of the first day of our 2009 fiscal year we would have reported an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscalyear 2009 of approximately 18 million primarily attributable to the difference between the increased amount of interest income from notes held net of interest expense to third party debt holders and the previously recorded accretion income attributed to residual interests for our past securitization transactions after we adopt these new accounting standards we will recognize higher amounts of interest income from notes held and interest expense and we will no longer recognize gains from the sales of our timeshare notes 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties we depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels as well as to develop timeshare properties capital markets were disrupted in the fourth quarter of 2008 and have remained challenging due to the worldwide financial crisis we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we also periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities obtain credit facilities from lenders or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

our credit facility which expires on may 14 2012 and associated letters of credit provide for 24 billion of aggregate effective borrowings and has supported our commercial paper program borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a fixed spread based on the credit ratings for our public debt we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating for additional information on our credit facility including participating financial institutions see exhibit 10 “amended and restated credit agreement” to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on may 16 2007 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits the company’s maximum leverage consisting of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit facility to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including the leverage covenant under the credit facility and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we need to do so in the future 

we believe the credit facility together with cash we expect to generate from operations remains adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

at yearend 2009 our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1978 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of 1863 billion under our credit facility and our cash balance of 115 million borrowing capacity under our credit facility of 1863 billion was calculated as 2404 billion of allowable effective aggregate borrowings under our credit facility less letters of credit outstanding totaling 116 million and less credit facility borrowings outstanding of 425 million as noted in the previous paragraphs we anticipate that this available capacity will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs and because we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions become considerably worse than we currently anticipate 

until the 2008 fourth quarter when disruptions in the financial markets significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market we regularly issued shortterm commercial paper primarily in the united states and to a much lesser extent in europe at that time we suspended issuing commercial paper and used funds borrowed under the credit facility to repay all of our previously issued commercial paper as it matured our standard and poor’s commercial paper rating at the end of 2009 was a3 because the current market for a3 commercial paper is very limited it would be very difficult to rely on the use of this market as a meaningful source of liquidity and we do not anticipate issuing commercial paper under these conditions 

when we had commercial paper outstanding we classified it as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis we reserved unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market was not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings matured as was the case in the 2008 fourth quarter given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility the limitations on our ability to access the commercial paper market and fluctuations in the costs of issuing commercial paper have not affected our liquidity and we do not expect they will do so in the future 

in 2009 the three major credit rating agencies reduced our longterm debt ratings to their lowest investment grade level although the agencies’ published outlooks indicate that they do not currently plan to reduce our debt ratings to below investment grade we cannot assure you that our ratings will remain at their current levels any further downgrades of our longterm debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch ratings or other similar rating agencies could increase our cost of capital limit our access to the capital markets or permit access only on terms that are more restrictive than those of our current outstanding debt 

  

on september 15 2009 we made a 79 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire at maturity all of our then outstanding series c senior notes we do not have any further public debt maturities until june 15 2012 

cash from operations 

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

 

 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 12 to 10 at yearend 2009 and 13 to 10 at yearend 2008 we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies and aggressive collection efforts we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to our 2009 annual report on form 10k are as follows 

 

 in response to significantly lower demand for our timeshare products we have correspondingly reduced our projected investment in new development see “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” section for additional information while our timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we include timeshare reportable sales that we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or when the notes are sold for cash the following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare segment which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our timeshare segment 

 

 additionally as discussed in more detail in the “timeshare residual interests valuation” caption in footnote no 21 “restructuring costs and other charges” eight previously securitized note pools reached performance triggers in 2009 as a result of increased defaults as of yearend 2009 loan performance had improved sufficiently in all but one of these pools to cure the performance triggers as compared to full year 2008 our cash inflows were reduced by approximately 17 million in 2009 as a result of the performance triggers 

on march 9 2009 we completed a private placement of approximately 205 million of floatingrate timeshare loan backed notes with a bankadministered commercial paper conduit we contributed approximately 284 million of notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products to a newly formed special purpose entity the “20091 trust” on the same day the 20091 trust issued approximately 205 million of the 20091 trust’s notes in connection with the private placement of notes receivable we received proceeds of approximately 181 million net of costs and retained 94 million of residual interests in the special purpose entity which included 81 million of notes we effectively owned after the transfer and 13 million related to the servicing assets and interest only strip we measured all residual interests at fair market value on the date of the transfer the notes effectively owned after the transfer require accounting treatment as notes receivable and are carried at the basis established at the date of transfer unless we deem them nonrecoverable in the future in which case we would record a valuation allowance in connection with this march 2009 note sale we recorded a 1 million loss which was included within the “timeshare sales and services” line item in our condensed consolidated statements of income 

  

on october 21 2009 we sold a pool of approximately 380 million in timeshare mortgage loans to a newly formed special purpose entity the “20092 trust” simultaneous with the sale investors purchased 317 million of 4809 percent timeshare loan backed notes from the 20092 trust in a private placement as part of this transaction we paid off the notes that the 20091 trust issued in march 2009 and reacquired approximately 233 million of timeshare mortgage loans that were released from the 20091 trust we included approximately 218 million of these reacquired loans in the october 21 2009 sale as consideration for our sale of the timeshare mortgage loans we received cash proceeds of approximately 168 million and a subordinated residual interest in the 20092 trust through which we expect to realize the remaining value of the mortgage loans over time these cash proceeds are net of approximately 145 million paid to the commercial paper conduit to unwind the first quarter transaction in connection with this october 2009 note sale we recorded a 38 million gain which was included within the “timeshare sales and services” line item in our condensed consolidated statements of income 

during 2008 and much of 2009 less favorable conditions in the asset securitization markets significantly reduced our gain from timeshare segment note sales as the trusts that purchased our mortgage notes had to issue debt at higher relative interest rates and lower overall amounts in proportion to the amounts of mortgage notes purchased as a result in the second quarter 2008 and for both transactions in 2009 we retained larger residual interests in the applicable trusts than we had in prior transactions in the first quarter 2009 note sale the bank administered conduit that purchased our aaa rated mortgage notes provided 205 million in funding with the floating interest rate swapped into an effective fixed interest rate of 987 percent this compares with effective interest rates after taking into account the impact of the corresponding swaps for the aaa rated notes issued by the trusts of 719 percent for the 2008 second quarter notes sale 591 percent for the 2007 fourth quarter note sale and 554 percent for the 2007 second quarter note sale by the fourth quarter of 2009 the market improved and we issued 380 million of aaa rated mortgage notes included both new mortgage notes of 162 million and mortgage notes from the conduit transaction in the first quarter of 2009 of 218 million at an effective fixed interest rate of 481 percent in addition while the trusts in two 2007 securitizations each also issued 155 percent of the total principal amount of their asset backed notes at ratings of less than aaa we concluded that the market for lower rated notes during 2008 and 2009 was insufficient to permit issuance of aa a and bbb rated notes at attractive spreads accordingly we decided to retain larger residual interests or principalonly strips in the trusts associated with each transaction 

we had residual interests of 214 million and 221 million respectively at yearend 2009 and yearend 2008 which we recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as other longterm receivables of 144 million and 134 million respectively and other current assets of 70 million and 87 million respectively 

our servicing assets and residual interests which we measured using level 3 inputs which are described in footnote no 5 “fair value measurements” in the fair value measurement hierarchy accounted for 91 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at yearend 2009 that are required to be measured at fair value using the fair value measurement guidance we treat the residual interests including servicing assets as trading securities under the provisions for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and accordingly we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the “timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our consolidated statements of income during 2009 and 2008 we recorded trading gains of 18 million and losses of 9 million respectively and in 2007 we recorded trading gains of 30 million for additional information on how we estimate the fair value of our residual interests and our assumptions used including a stress test of those assumptions please see footnote no 5 “fair value measurements” 

for additional information on our timeshare note sales including a discussion of the cash flows on securitized notes our maximum exposure to loss on those securitized notes and contractual servicing fees that we earned see footnote no 13 “asset securitizations” see also “future adoption of accounting standards” and footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” for discussions of the expected impact of our future adoption of amendments to the accounting standards for transfers of financial assets and to reporting on a consolidated basis on existing and future asset securitizations 

we estimate that for the 20year period from 2010 through 2029 the cost of completing all phases of our existing portfolio of owned timeshare properties will be approximately 29 billion this estimate is based on our current development plans which remain subject to change 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 147 million in 2009 357 million in 2008 and 671 million in 2007 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives timeshare segment development expenditures which are included in “cash from operations” as noted in that section are not reflected in these numbers capital expenditures decreased primarily due to reduced development spending a result of our cost containment efforts as well as expenditures related to improvements to existing properties that were completed in the prior year  we expect that nearterm 

  

capital expenditures will be consistent with 2009 levels see the discussion of “development and financing risks” within the risk factors section of this document for possible impacts of this reduction over time we have sold lodging properties under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions we expect to continue to make selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans and noncontrolling equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging and timeshare segments because 1 we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure 

dispositions property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 2 million in 2009 38 million in 2008 and 745 million in 2007 

loan activity we have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel based on historical experience over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit loan collections and sales net of advances during 2009 and 2008 amounted to net loan advances of 45 million and 17 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively senior loans outstanding totaled 1 million which included a current portion of 1 million at yearend 2009 and 2 million all of which was longterm at yearend 2008 mezzanine and other loans totaled 195 million which included a current portion of 95 million at yearend 2009 and 236 million which included a current portion of 15 million at yearend 2008 in 2009 our notes receivable balance associated with senior mezzanine and other loans decreased by 42 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserves against loans 

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 28 million in 2009 25 million in 2008 and 40 million in 2007 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures 

cash from financing activities 

debt debt decreased by 797 million in 2009 to 2298 million at yearend 2009 from 3095 million and reflected a 544 million decrease in borrowings under our credit facility the repayment upon maturity of 79 million including interest of series c senior notes in 2009 the repurchase of 119 million in book value 122 million in principal amount of senior notes across multiple series and other debt decreases of 57 million debt increased by 130 million in 2008 to 3095 million at yearend 2008 from 2965 million at yearend 2007 and reflected 969 million of borrowings under our credit facility mostly offset by the decrease in commercial paper outstanding of 585 million the repayment upon maturity of 91 million of series e senior notes in the 2008 first quarter repurchase of 109 million of senior notes across multiple series and other debt decreases of 54 million 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2009 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 49 percent and an average maturity of approximately 47 years the ratio of fixedrate longterm debt to total longterm debt was 08 to 10 at yearend 2009 at the end of 2009 we had longterm public debt ratings of bbb from standard and poor’s and baa3 from moody’s 

see the “cash requirements and our credit facilities” caption within this “liquidity and capital resources” section for additional information on our credit facility 

in 2009 we repurchased 122 million principal amount of our senior notes in the open market across multiple series we recorded a gain of 21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debt’s purchase price of 98 million and its carrying amount of 119 million in 2008 we repurchased 109 million of our senior notes in the open market across multiple series we recorded a gain of 28 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debt’s purchase price of 77 million and its carrying amount of 105 million of the debt 

share repurchases we did not purchase any shares of our class a common stock in 2009 we purchased 119 million shares of our class a common stock in 2008 at an average price of 3118 per share and 410 million shares of our class a common stock in 2007 at an average price of 4332 per share we purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions as of yearend 2009 213 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our board of directors we do not currently anticipate share repurchase activity in 2010 

  

dividends the board of directors declared a cash dividend on february 4 2010 and stock dividends on may 1 august 6 and november 5 2009 respectively as a result for periods prior to the stock dividends we have retroactively adjusted as of the dates of record all share and per share data in this report see footnote no 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” for additional information on these stock dividends

the following table summarizes our guarantee commitments as of yearend 2009 

guarantee commitments 

 

 in addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of 586 million our liability related to this guarantee is included in our liability for anticipated project funding disclosed in footnote no 20 “timeshare strategyimpairment charges” we have provided a project completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of cad 466 million usd 441 million we do not expect to fund under this project completion guarantee for additional information on these project completion guarantees including our pro rata ownership percentages see the “guarantees” caption within footnote no 18 “contingencies” 

for additional information on our guarantees including their nature and the circumstances under which they were entered into see the “guarantees” caption within footnote no 18 “contingencies” 

in addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions 

  

we also had the following other commitments including loan and investment commitments outstanding at yearend 2009 

loan and investment commitments 

 

 for further information on our loan and investment commitments including the nature of the commitments and their expirations see the “loan and investment commitments” caption within footnote no 18 “contingencies”

in the normal course of the hotel management business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow 

related party transactions 

equity method investments 

we have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management andor franchise services and receive fees in addition in some cases we provide loans preferred equity or guarantees to these entities our ownership interests in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 49 percent for other information regarding these equity method investments including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties see footnote no 24 “related party transactions” 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 1 it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

while we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly additionally changes in our assumptions estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them

terms of our management agreements vary but typically we earn a management fee which comprises a base management fee which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel and an incentive management fee which is based on the profits of the hotel our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations both direct and indirect such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years with options to renew for up to 50 or more additional years our lease agreements also vary but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a percentage of annual revenues in excess of a fixed amount many of the operating agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners additionally many of our operating agreements permit the owners to terminate the agreement if certain performance metrics are not met and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies

 other activities 

marriott golf manages 43 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners 

we operate 13 systemwide hotel reservation centers eight in the united states and canada and five in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others 

we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ® best rate guarantee gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our web site or any other marriott reservation channel also key to our success is our strong marriott rewards loyalty program and our informationrich and easytouse wwwmarriottcom web site our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective with almost 3200 hotels economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and maximize our fee revenue 

in late 2007 we rolled out sales force one a sales deployment strategy that aligns sales efforts around customer needs we believe that this strategy will reduce duplication of sales efforts and enable coverage for a larger number of accounts to support this strategy we have begun realigning our sales organization to provide a primary point of contact for group business transient extended stay and catering customers the realigned sales organization will be known as global sales which will be made up of four components enterprise sales which is responsible for setting overall segment strategies and accountspecific strategies for large corporate and association customers area sales assigned to a designated geographical area and which is responsible for proactively selling a crossbrand portfolio property sales which is responsible for booking group and catering business that falls outside sales office parameters and the sales office which is responsible for evaluating and closing inbound leads developing new business and executing event planning for select service and extended stay hotels 

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising there are approximately 815 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

in the current economic environment faced with softening demand we have taken steps to reduce operating costs due to the competitive nature of our industry we have focused these efforts on areas that have limited or no impact on the guest experience while additional reductions may become necessary to preserve operating margins we 

  

would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty owner preference and associate satisfaction to help maintain or increase our market share 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2008 approximately 68 percent of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is fairly concentrated with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have a 9 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties competitor hotels converting to one of marriott’s brands typically complete renovations in conjunction with the conversion 

the vacation ownership industry is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies since entering the timeshare industry in 1984 we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide competition in the timeshare interval fractional and residential business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts trust in the brand the pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits such as exchange programs we believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences combined with our financial strength diverse market presence strong brands and wellmaintained properties will enable us to remain competitive approximately 53 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners 

marriott rewards is a frequent guest program with over 30 million members and nine participating marriott brands the marriott rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 32 participating airline programs we believe that marriott rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels and allows the company to tailor promotional offerings to guest needs and interests in 2008 approximately 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by marriott rewards members in addition the ability of timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into marriott rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brands effective january 15 2009 the marriott rewards program eliminated blackout dates at nearly 2900 hotels worldwide giving marriott rewards members greater access to redemption nights at the company’s brands 

in the recent difficult economic climate marriott has rolled out aggressive new marketing programs to drive demand leveraging marriott rewards and wwwmarriottcom  

discontinued operations 

synthetic fuel 

our synthetic fuel operation consisted of four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” because tax credits under section 45k of the irc are not available for the production and sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar yearend 2007 we shut down the facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel in late 2007 accordingly we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation contemporaneously with the shutdown we transferred the facilities to the lessors of the sites where the facilities were located in exchange for the release of our obligations under the leases to restore the premises to their original conditions the book value of the facilities was zero at yearend 2007 as a result of the facilities being transferred to the lessors costs associated with shutting down the synthetic fuel operation and transferring the facilities to the site lessors were not material

 item 1a risk factors tableend forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the company and its financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

lodging industry risks 

the lodging industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for customers we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas this could limit our operating margins diminish our market share and reduce our earnings 

we are subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel timeshare and corporate apartment industries the profitability of the hotels vacation timeshare resorts and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand or the prices our hotels are able to obtain for hotel rooms timeshare units residential units and corporate apartments or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profit of our lodging businesses reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans guarantees and minority equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage even where such factors do not reduce demand propertylevel profit margins may suffer if we are unable to fully recover increased operating costs from our guests similarly our fee revenue could be impacted by weak propertylevel revenue or profitability 

our hotel management and franchise agreements may also be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section which the company fails or elects not to cure a significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business 

the current general economic recession and the slowdown in the lodging and timeshare industries will continue to impact our financial results and growth the present economic recession and the uncertainty over its depth and duration will continue to have a negative impact on the lodging and timeshare industries there is now general consensus among economists that the economies of the us europe and much of the rest of the world are now in a recession and we are experiencing reduced demand for our hotel rooms and timeshare products accordingly our financial results have been impacted by the economic slowdown and we expect that our future financial results and growth will be further harmed while the recession continues 

operational risks 

our lodging operations are subject to international national and regional conditions because we conduct our business on a national and international platform our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies in recent years our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from recent economic conditions the military action in iraq and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future economic performance is similarly subject to the economic environment in the united states and other regions which has become increasingly uncertain with recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies the current worldwide recession the resulting unknown pace of business travel and the occurrence of any future incidents in the countries where we operate 

new branded hotel products that we launch in the future may not be successful we may in the future launch additional branded hotel products we cannot assure that these brands will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing the brands or that the brands will be successful in addition each of these new brands involves cooperation andor consultation with a third party including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements with these third parties regarding areas of consultation or shared control could slow the development of these new brands andor impair our ability to take actions we believe to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

risks relating to natural disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters and the spread of contagious diseases such as avian flu and sars in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers can cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty can have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

we may have disputes with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both 

  

management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and may give rise to disagreements in some instances such disagreements may be more likely as hotel returns are depressed as a result of the current economic recession we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but have not always been able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has in the past resulted in litigation and could do so in the future 

damage to or other potential losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of insurance coverage that we can obtain and our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

development and financing risks 

while w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties we depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and to develop timeshare properties and we or our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control events over the past several months including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies and the contraction of available liquidity and leverage have impaired the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments as a result many current and prospective hotel owners are finding hotel financing on commercially viable terms to be difficult or impossible to obtain in addition the bankruptcy of lehman brothers and the financial condition of other lenders has prevented some projects that are in construction or development including a few in which the company has minority equity investments from drawing on existing financing commitments and replacement financing may not be available or may only be available on less favorable terms delays increased costs and other impediments to restructuring such projects will reduce our ability to realize fees recover loans and guarantee advances or realize equity investments from such projects our ability to recover loan and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from owners through the proceeds of hotel sales refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital in addition any future downgrade of our credit ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or other rating agencies could reduce our availability of capital and increase our cost of capital 

continued or increased volatility in the credit markets will likely continue to impair our ability to sell the loans that our timeshare business generates our timeshare business provides financing to purchasers of our timeshare and fractional properties and we periodically sell interests in those loans in the securities markets recent declines in the credit markets will likely continue to impair the timing and volume of the timeshare loans that we sell market conditions during the first half of 2008 resulted in terms that were less favorable to us than they were historically and further deterioration prevented a planned fourth quarter 2008 sale may delay planned 2009 sales or sharply increase their cost to us until the markets stabilize or prevent us from selling our timeshare notes entirely although we expect to realize the economic value of our timeshare note portfolio even if future note sales are temporarily or indefinitely delayed such delays in note sales could reduce or postpone future gains cause us to reduce spending in order to maintain our leverage and return targets and could also result in increased borrowing to provide capital to replace proceeds from such sales 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site 

  

availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks we develop new hotel timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties our involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 recent and continued declines in the capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or development of future properties 2 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to increases in mortgage rates andor decreases in mortgage availability market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate 3 construction delays cost overruns lender financial defaults or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations and 4 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for projects that are not pursued to completion 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion such disputes may also be more likely in the current difficult investment environment 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties that are associated with our lodging and timeshare properties or brands may reduce our profits in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate through minority interests andor licensing fees in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including luxury residences and condominiums under our ritzcarlton and marriott brands such projects pose additional risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging and timeshare businesses which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 

 

  

  

 technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position the lodging and timeshare industries continue to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards program and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis if we are unable to do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet services to book online hotel reservations could adversely impact our revenues  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  travelocitycom ®  and orbitzcom ®  as well as lesserknown online travel service providers these intermediaries initially focused on leisure travel but now also provide offerings for corporate travel and group meetings although marriott’s look no further ® best rate guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels intermediaries continue to use a variety of aggressive online marketing methods to attract customers including the purchase by certain companies of trademarked online keywords such as “marriott” 

  

from internet search engines such as google ® and yahoo ® to steer customers toward their web sites a practice currently being challenged by various trademark owners in federal court although marriott has successfully limited these practices through contracts with key online intermediaries the number of intermediaries and related companies that drive traffic to intermediaries’ web sites is too large to permit us to eliminate this risk entirely our business and profitability could be harmed if online intermediaries succeed in significantly shifting loyalties from our lodging brands to their travel services diverting bookings away from marriottcom or through their fees increasing the overall cost of internet bookings for our hotels 

failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions damage of reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers as they are entered into processed by summarized by and reported by our various information systems and those of our service providers we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to us if that data is inaccurate or incomplete we could make faulty decisions our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding both in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines and litigation 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively our timeshare segment and to a lesser extent our other lodging segments rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the telemarketing sales rule canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing email and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

other risks 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we are not able to recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director’s consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes in connection with mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder rights plan to replace the stockholder’s rights plan that expired in march 2008

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend business and overview 

we are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3178 properties 560681 rooms and related facilities the figures in the preceding sentence are as of yearend 2008 and include 27 home and condominium projects 2482 units for which we manage the related owners’ associations in addition we provided 2332 furnished corporate housing rental units which are not included in the totals 

our operations are grouped into five business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging luxury lodging and timeshare we operate develop and franchise under 18 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories 

we earn base incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare segment 1 selling timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties 2 operating the resorts and residential properties and 3 financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals finally we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate 

we sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a standalone basis under the ritzcarlton brand ritzcarltonresidential and in conjunction with timeshare segment projects ritzcarlton clubresidential and grand residences by marriottresidential our timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time other residences are typically constructed and sold by thirdparty developers with limited amounts if any of our capital at risk while the worldwide residential market is very large the luxurious nature of our residential properties the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands and the hospitality services that we provide all serve to make our residential properties distinctive 

the economic recession the global credit crisis and eroded consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2008 us lodging demand declined throughout 2008 but especially in the fourth quarter as a result of slowing economic growth outside the united states international lodging demand was generally stronger in most markets than in the united states but also softened progressively throughout 2008 and declined markedly in the 2008 fourth quarter leisure transient demand in the united states weakened in the first quarter of 2008 and was joined by weakening business transient demand beginning in the second quarter of 2008 additionally demand associated with our luxury properties decreased dramatically in the 2008 fourth quarter these factors were compounded in several markets in the united states where the supply of hotel rooms increased last minute new group meeting demand and attendance at group meetings softened considerably throughout 2008 as well and group meeting cancellations increased significantly in the fourth quarter while some business customers increased room nights in 2008 including professional services firms defense contractors and insurance companies others declined including companies associated with the financial services automotive and telecommunications industries in general for the properties in our system international and fullservice properties experienced stronger demand worldwide than our limitedservice and luxury properties 

us demand for timeshare intervals also softened considerably in 2008 and especially in the fourth quarter reflecting weak consumer confidence and a very difficult financing environment while demand in latin america and asia for timeshare products was stronger compared to 2007 demand for ritzcarlton fractional and residential units was particularly weak since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentageofcompletion accounting method soft demand is frequently not reflected in our timeshare segment results until later accounting periods intentional and unintentional construction delays could also unfavorably impact nearerterm timeshare segment results as percentageofcompletion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well 

responding to the challenging demand environment in 2008 for hotel rooms we initiated a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase propertylevel revenue these promotions were designed to keep current customers loyal while also attracting new guests in response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings we have also implemented sales associate and customer incentives to close on business as more customers use social media we have also found new ways to connect communicating with more than 300000 of our customers on youtube twitter facebook and through our blog “marriott on the move” we also continue to enhance our marriott rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically market to this large and growing customer base 

  

given this slower demand environment we worked aggressively to reduce costs and enhance propertylevel house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours reviewing and adjusting room amenities and not filling some vacant positions while varying by property most properties in our system have instituted contingency plans with very tight cost controls we have also reduced the aboveproperty costs by scaling back systems processing and support areas that are allocated to the hotels we have also eliminated certain positions not filled some vacant positions and will encourage and where legally permitted require employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year additionally we canceled certain hotel development projects for our timeshare segment we have slowed or canceled some development projects closed less efficient timeshare sales offices and increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives for additional information on our companywide restructuring efforts see our “restructuring costs and other charges” caption later in this section 

our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels rather than owning them at yearend 2008 48 percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements 50 percent were operated under franchise agreements and 2 percent were owned or leased by us our emphasis on property management and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion reflecting properties added to our system generates ongoing growth with longterm management and franchise agreements this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing leverage and risk in a cyclical industry additionally by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make we increase our financial flexibility 

we calculate revpar by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties references to revpar throughout this report are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted 

for our north american comparable properties revpar decreased in 2008 compared to the yearago period with moderately greater strength in manhattan new york houston texas orlando florida and los angeles california and weaker revpar in suburban markets near among other areas orange county california chicago illinois and detroit michigan outside north america 2008 revpar increases versus the prior year period were stronger particularly in the middle east central and southeast asia south america and central europe 

companyoperated house profit margin is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit also known as house profit to total propertylevel revenue we consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control gross operating profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

compared to 2007 worldwide comparable companyoperated house profit margins for 2008 decreased by 70 basis points reflecting the impact of stronger yearoveryear revpar associated with international properties and very strong cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system this impact was more than offset by the impact of revpar declines yearoveryear associated with properties in north america reflecting weaker demand and higher expenses in 2008 in north america primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs 

the company’s fiscal year ends on the friday nearest december 31 and while the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years included 52 weeks the 2008 fiscal year included 53 weeks as the 53 rd week for 2008 included the new year’s holiday and was seasonally slow it had the effect of reducing yearoveryear revpar performance while worldwide comparable revpar for 2008 for companyoperated properties decreased 11 percent compared to 2007 worldwide comparable revpar for 2008 for companyoperated properties excluding the extra 53 rd week decreased 04 percent compared to 2007 

our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction the worldwide presence and quality of our brands our marriott rewards loyalty program an informationrich and easytouse web site a multichannel central reservations system and desirable property amenities we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of new refreshed and reinvented properties new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary web site wwwmarriottcom  through functionality and service improvements and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of propertylevel reservations via this costefficient channel we have added other languages to marriottcom and we have enabled guests to use handheld devices to make and confirm reservations and get directions

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2008 2007 and 2006 

continuing operations 

revenues 

2008 compared to 2007 

revenues decreased by 111 million 1 percent to 12879 million in 2008 from 12990 million in 2007 primarily as a result of lower timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system base management and franchise fees increased by 27 million as a result of improved revpar in international markets and unit growth partially offset by the impact of declines in north american revpar the 27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling 6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and 13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008 incentive management fees decreased by 58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of 1 incentive management fees totaling 17 million that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2007 and 2 13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with hurricane katrina the decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower propertylevel profitability due to lower occupancy and higher propertylevel wages and benefits costs and utilities costs particularly in north america partially offsetting the decreases incentive management fees from international properties increased reflecting revpar and unit growth see the “business segments” discussion later in this report for additional information 

the 15 million 1 percent decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue largely reflected 10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties 17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the receipt in 2008 of 15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees compared to 19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate totaling 64 million in both 2008 and 2007 partially offset by 17 million of higher corporate housing revenue the 10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels 

timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by 324 million 19 percent compared to the prior year the decrease primarily reflected lower demand in 2008 revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008 as well as a decrease of 65 million in note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the asia pacific points program increased interest income revenue associated with projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007 and increased services revenue see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our timeshare segment 

the 111 million decrease in total revenue includes 259 million 3 percent of increased cost reimbursements revenue to 8834 million in 2008 from 8575 million in the prior year this revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income the increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage we added six managed properties 3100 rooms and 157 franchised properties 19836 rooms to our system in 2008 net of properties exiting the system 

2007 compared to 2006 

revenues increased by 995 million 8 percent to 12990 million in 2007 from 11995 million in 2006 as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide base management and franchise fees increased by 116 million as a result of stronger revpar and unit growth as we opened 203 properties 29200 rooms throughout 2007 in 2006 we recognized 

  

5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2006 versus no similar fees in 2007 incentive management fees increased by 88 million due to stronger revpar and propertylevel margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements incentive management fees included 17 million and 10 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized furthermore incentive management fees for 2007 included 13 million and base management fees for 2007 included 6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to 1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006 stronger catering food and beverage spa and other profits also drove propertylevel margins higher yearoveryear revpar increases were driven primarily by rate increases 

timeshare sales and services revenue increased by 170 million 11 percent in 2007 over the prior year the increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds in 2006 some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007 the increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our timeshare segment 

owned leased corporate housing and other revenue increased by 121 million 11 percent the increase largely reflected stronger revpar and the mix of owned and leased properties in 2007 compared to 2006 and to a lesser extent higher branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaling 64 million in 2007 and 52 million in 2006 offset by the recognition of 19 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007 compared to the recognition of 26 million of such fees in 2006 

the 995 million increase in total revenue includes 500 million 6 percent of increased cost reimbursements revenue to 8575 million in 2007 from 8075 million in the prior year the increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage we added 15 managed properties 4870 rooms and 138 franchised properties 15963 rooms to our system in 2007 net of properties exiting the system 

restructuring costs and other charges 

during the latter part of 2008 we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result in part of the recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy our capitalintensive timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008 these declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees cancellation of development projects reduced timeshare contract sales and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans we responded by implementing certain companywide costsaving measures with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further costsaving measures upperlevel management responsible for the timeshare segment hotel operations development and aboveproperty level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives the various initiatives resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of 55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 we also incurred other charges including charges for guarantees and reserves for loan losses and inventory writedowns on timeshare inventory reserves on accounts receivable contract cancellation allowances a charge related to the valuation of timeshare residual interests a charge associated with hedge ineffectiveness related to timeshare note sale hedges and asset impairments and other charges detailed further in “other charges” 

as part of the restructuring efforts in our timeshare segment we reduced and consolidated sales channels in the united states and closed down certain operations in europe we recorded timeshare restructuring costs of 28 million in the 2008 fourth quarter including 1 14 million in severance costs 2 5 million in facilities exit costs primarily associated with noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income arising from the reduction in personnel and 3 9 million related to the writeoff of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable we expect to complete this restructuring by yearend 2009 we are projecting 55 million to 65 million 35 million to 42 million aftertax of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring these savings will likely be reflected in the “timesharedirect” and the “general administrative and other expenses” captions in our consolidated statements of income 

as part of the hotel development restructuring efforts across several of our lodging segments we discontinued certain development projects that required our investment we recorded restructuring costs in the 2008 fourth quarter of 24 million including 1 2 million in severance costs and 2 22 million related to the writeoff of 

  

capitalized costs relating to development projects that we discontinued including capitalized costs related to owned development of renaissance clubsport we expect to complete this restructuring by yearend 2009 we are projecting up to 6 million 4 million aftertax of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring these savings will likely be reflected in the “general administrative and other expenses” caption in our consolidated statements of income 

we also implemented restructuring initiatives by reducing aboveproperty level lodging management personnel and corporate overhead we incurred 2008 fourth quarter restructuring costs of 3 million primarily reflecting severance costs we expect to complete this restructuring by yearend 2009 we are projecting up to 4 million 3 million aftertax of annual cost savings beginning in 2009 as a result of the restructuring these savings will likely be reflected in the “general administrative and other expenses” caption in our consolidated statements of income 

we have provided detailed information related to these restructuring costs and other charges below 

restructuring costs 

severance 

these various restructuring initiatives resulted in an overall reduction of 1021 employees the majority of whom were terminated by january 2 2009 across the company we recorded a total workforce reduction charge of 19 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits which consisted of 14 million for the timeshare segment 2 million related to hotel development and 3 million related to aboveproperty level lodging management and corporate overhead the charge does not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for propertylevel severance costs we also delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours in connection with these initiatives we expect to incur an additional 3 million to 4 million related to severance and fringe benefits in 2009 for the timeshare segment 

facilities exit costs 

as a result of workforce reductions and delays in filling vacant positions that were part of the timeshare segment restructuring we ceased using certain leased facilities we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately 5 million associated with these facilities primarily related to noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income in connection with these initiatives in 2009 we expect to incur an additional 2 million to 3 million related to ceasing use of additional noncancelable leases 

development cancellations 

we sometimes incur certain costs associated with the development of hotel and timeshare properties including legal costs the cost of land and planning and design costs we capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed as a result of the sharp downturn in the economy we decided to discontinue certain development projects that required our investment including our renaissance clubsport real estate development activities these cancellations do not impact the two renaissance clubsport properties that are currently open as a result of these development cancellations we expensed 31 million of previously capitalized costs which consisted of 9 million of costs for the timeshare segment and 22 million of costs related to hotel development we do not currently expect to expense any additional capitalized costs in 2009 in connection with these restructuring initiatives 

other charges 

charges for guarantees and reserves for loan losses 

we sometimes issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with some financing transactions and other obligations we also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage as a result of the downturn in the economy certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners may not be able to meet debt service obligations to us or in some cases to thirdparty lending institutions in addition we expect profit levels at a few hotels to drop below guaranteed levels as a result based on cash flow projections we expect to fund under some of our guarantees which we do not deem recoverable and we expect that one of the loans made by us will not be repaid according to its original terms due to the expected fundings under guarantees that we deemed nonrecoverable we recorded charges of 16 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the “general administrative and other expenses” caption in our consolidated statements of income due to the expected loan loss we recorded a charge of 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the “provision for loan losses” caption in our consolidated statements of income 

  

timeshare inventory writedowns 

as a result of terminating certain phases of timeshare development in europe we recorded an inventory writedown of 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded this charge in the “timesharedirect” caption of our consolidated statements of income 

accounts receivablebad debts 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we reserved 4 million of accounts receivable which we deemed uncollectible generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment following an analysis of those accounts we recorded this charge in the “general administrative and other expenses” caption in our consolidated statements of income 

timeshare contract cancellation allowances 

our financial statements reflect net contract cancellation allowances totaling 12 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue and cost previously recorded for certain projects under the percentageofcompletion method will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing we have an equity method investment in one of these projects and reflected 7 million of the 12 million in the “equity in earnings” caption in our consolidated statements of income the remaining net 5 million of contract cancellation allowances consisted of a reduction in revenue net of adjustments to product costs and other direct costs and was recorded in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct costs 

timeshare residual interests valuation 

the fair market value of our residual interest in timeshare notes sold declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which we discount future cash flows to estimate the fair market value of the retained interests the increase in the market rate of interest reflects deteriorating economic conditions and disruption in the credit markets which significantly increased the borrowing costs to issuers as a result of this change we recorded a 32 million charge in the “timeshare sales and services” caption in our consolidated statements of income to reflect the decrease in the fair value of these residual interests 

timeshare hedge ineffectiveness 

given the significant deterioration in the credit markets we expect that any potential note sale transactions pursued by the company in the near term will be materially different from arrangements originally contemplated and accordingly the sensitivity of a hedge the company previously entered into to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted note sales no longer significantly corresponds to the sensitivity in expected note sale proceeds differences include expected legal structures modifications to priority of cash flow and higher costs the change in terms inputs used to determine hedge effectiveness for timeshare’s note sale hedges resulted in the recognition of 12 million in hedge ineffectiveness we recorded this hedge ineffectiveness as a reduction in note sale gains in the “timeshare sales and services” caption in our consolidated statements of income 

asset impairments and other charges 

one project that is in development and in which the company has a joint venture investment was unable to draw on existing financing commitments as a result of the recent turmoil in the capital markets and the bankruptcy of the project’s major lender as a result based on our analysis of expected future cash flows we determined that our investment in that joint venture was fully impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 9 million in the “equity in earnings” caption in our consolidated statements of income 

in addition as a result of the economic downturn and the inability of certain developers to obtain financing we also recorded writeoffs of other assets 12 million related to development costs associated with projects we no longer deem probable in the “general administrative and other expenses” caption of our consolidated statements of income 

we also deemed certain cost method tax investments to be otherthantemporarily impaired because we do not expect to receive any future economic benefit from these investments accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of 9 million for those investments in the “gains and other income” caption of our consolidated statements of income 

  

summary of restructuring costs and other charges 

the following table is a summary of the restructuring costs and other charges we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as our remaining liability at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 and remaining restructuring costs expected to be incurred in 2009 as part of these restructuring initiatives 

 

 we anticipate that the remaining liability related to the workforce reduction will be substantially paid by the end of 2009 for the timeshare segment by the end of 2009 for hotel development and by the end of 2009 for aboveproperty level management the amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities in the timeshare segment will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012 the remaining liability related to expected fundings under guarantees will likely be substantially paid by yearend 2010 the following tables provide further detail on these charges including a breakdown by segment

 the following tables provide further detail on restructuring costs we expect to incur in 2009 including breakdown by segment 

2009 expected operating income impact 

 

 operating income 

2008 compared to 2007 

operating income decreased by 403 million 34 percent to 785 million in 2008 from 1188 million in 2007 the decrease in operating income reflected 261 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 41 million of lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 58 million of lower incentive management fees 55 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2008 and a 15 million increase in general administrative and other expenses partially offset by an increase in combined base management and franchise fees of 27 million 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses for 2008 totaled 89 million the decline of 261 million 75 percent from the prior year primarily reflected 138 million of lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs 95 million of lower financing revenue net of financing expenses 34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses partially offset by 4 million of higher services revenue net of expenses and 2 million of lower joint venture related expenses lower development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare interval fractional and residential products lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008 a 22 million pretax impairment charge 10 million net of minority interest benefit startup costs and low reportability in 2008 associated with newer projects that have not yet reached revenue recognition thresholds as well as lower revenue recognition for several projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 the decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year see “business segments timeshare” later in this report for additional information regarding our timeshare segment 

the 41 million 23 percent decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 21 million of lower income reflecting conversions from owned properties to managed properties 4 million of lower termination fees and 17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year partially offsetting the decreases were lower depreciation charges totaling 6 million in 2008 associated with one property compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2007 of 8 million associated with that same property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” 

general administrative and other expenses increased by 15 million 2 percent to 783 million in 2008 from 768 million in 2007 this increase reflected the following items 44 million of increased expenses associated with among other things our unit growth and development systems improvements and initiatives to enhance our brands globally a 16 million charge for certain guarantees an unfavorable 9 million variance for reserve reversals in 2007 12 million in writeoffs in 2008 of costs related to development cancellations 4 million of increased foreign exchange losses and 4 million of charges related to bad debt reserves on accounts receivable see “other charges” section of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” for additional information on the charge related to certain guarantees development cancellation writeoffs and bad debt reserves these unfavorable 

  

variances were partially offset by a favorable variance related to a 2007 charge of 35 million resulting from excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the examination by the internal revenue service “irs” and department of labor of our employee stock ownership plan “esop” feature of our employees’ profit sharing retirement and savings plan and trust the “plan” see footnote no 2 “income taxes” for additional information on the esop settlement additionally 2008 included a 28 million favorable impact associated with deferred compensation expenses compared to an 11 million unfavorable impact in the prior year both of which reflected marktomarket valuations of the 15 million increase in total general administrative and other expenses an increase of 51 million was attributable to our lodging and timeshare segments and a decrease of 36 million reflecting the 2007 esop settlement charge was unallocated 

the reasons for the decrease of 58 million in incentive management fees as well as the combined base management and franchise fees increase of 27 million over the prior year are noted in the preceding “revenues” section 

2007 compared to 2006 

operating income increased by 101 million 9 percent to 1188 million in 2007 from 1087 million in the prior year the increase in operating income reflects stronger combined base management incentive management and franchise fees of 204 million partially offset by higher general administrative and other expenses of 91 million lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of 7 million and lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses of 5 million 

the combined base management incentive management and franchise fees increase of 204 million reflected strong revpar growth unit growth and propertylevel margin improvements and favorable exchange rates worldwide in 2006 we recognized 5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2006 versus no similar fees in 2007 incentive management fees included 17 million and 10 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized furthermore incentive management fees for 2007 included 13 million and base management fees included 6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to 1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006 

compared to the yearago period general administrative and other expenses increased by 91 million 13 percent to 768 million in 2007 from 677 million in 2006 in 2007 we incurred a 35 million charge related to excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the irs and department of labor examination of our esop feature of our employees’ profit sharing retirement and savings plan and trust the “plan” see footnote no 2 “income taxes” for additional information on the esop settlement additionally the increase was attributable to among other things increased costs related to our unit growth development and systems improvements increased legal expenses and increased other administrative costs also unfavorably impacting general administrative and other expenses when compared to the prior year were foreign exchange losses totaling 2 million in 2007 compared to foreign exchange gains of 6 million in 2006 and 1 million of guarantee charges in 2007 while the yearago period reflected 6 million of guarantee reversals partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were 4 million of lower hotel operating agreement performance cure payments in 2007 compared to 2006 and a 9 million reversal in 2007 of reserves that were no longer required increased legal expenses in 2007 include charges associated with litigation and other legal matters of the 91 million increase in total general administrative and other expenses an increase of 13 million was attributable to our lodging and timeshare segments and a 78 million increase was unallocated 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of 350 million decreased by 7 million 2 percent compared to the prior year primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses more than offset by the reversal in 2006 of 15 million of contingency reserves and 4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 offset by several other projects that were approaching sellout the increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion interest income and higher note sale gains in 2007 compared to 2006 

the 5 million 3 percent decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected 19 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007 compared to 26 million in 2006 depreciation charges totaling 8 million were recorded in 2007 associated with one owned property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” during 2007 compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2006 of 7 million associated with two properties that were reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net 

  

of direct expenses was the favorable impact of 4 million associated with both the stronger demand environment in 2007 and the impact of the sale and purchase of several properties 

gains and other income expense 

the table below shows our gains and other income for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 2008 compared to 2007 

the 28 million gain on debt extinguishment in 2008 represents the difference between the purchase price and net carrying amount of our senior notes we repurchased for additional information on the debt extinguishment see the “liquidity and capital resources” section later in this report the 25 million decrease in gains on sales of real estate and other primarily reflected a 23 million gain associated with sales of real estate in our international segment as well as other smaller gains on sale of real estate in 2007 that did not occur in 2008 the 12 million gain on forgiveness of debt in 2007 was associated with government incentives noted in the “2007 compared to 2006” section below gain on saleincome on redemption of joint venture and other investments of 31 million in 2007 reflected an 18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling 13 million on the sale of joint venture investments income from cost method joint ventures decreased 17 million to a loss of 3 million in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to certain cost method tax investments that we deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired see the “other charges” section of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” for more information 

2007 compared to 2006 

the 12 million gain on forgiveness of debt for 2007 was associated with government incentives the loans were forgiven in recognition of our contribution to job growth and economic development gain on saleincome on redemption of joint venture and other investments of 31 million in 2007 reflected an 18 million gain associated with the sale of stock we held and net gains totaling 13 million on the sale of joint venture investments gain on saleincome on redemption of joint venture and other investments of 68 million in 2006 was comprised of 43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee which generated a gain of 25 million gains on sales of real estate and other increased 13 million in 2007 and primarily reflected a 23 million gain associated with sales of real estate by our international segment in 2007 that did not occur in 2006 partially offset by smaller gains in 2006 that did not occur in 2007 

interest expense 

2008 compared to 2007 

interest expense decreased by 21 million 11 percent to 163 million in 2008 compared to 184 million in 2007 the decrease in interest expense compared to the prior year reflected a charge of 13 million for interest on the excise taxes associated with the esop settlement in 2007 interest expense associated with commercial paper and our credit facility decreased in 2008 reflecting a reduction in the amount of commercial paper outstanding lower interest rates on commercial paper and increased borrowings under the credit facility with a lower interest rate as a result yearoveryear interest expense was lower by 7 million we also benefitted from a 15 million decrease in interest costs associated with various programs that we operate on behalf of owners including our marriott rewards gift certificates and selfinsurance programs as a result of lower interest rates a 6 million favorable variance to the prior year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects and the maturity of our series e senior notes in early 2008 yielding a 6 million favorable variance to the prior year the writeoff of 2 million of deferred financing costs in 2007 related to the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement resulted in a favorable variance in 2008 these favorable variances to the prior year were partially offset by the impact of the series i and series j senior notes issuances which occurred in the second half of 2007 that increased our interest expense in 2008 by 30 million 

  

2007 compared to 2006 

interest expense increased by 60 million 48 percent to 184 million for 2007 from 124 million in 2006 of the 60 million increase over 2006 78 million was due to 26 million of higher interest reflecting a higher outstanding commercial paper balance primarily due to increased share repurchases and the esop settlement payments and related interest rates 25 million of interest associated with our series h senior notes issuance which occurred late in 2006 and our series i and series j senior notes issuances which occurred in 2007 a charge of 13 million in 2007 related to the esop settlement charges totaling 53 million and 46 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf including our marriott rewards gift certificates and selfinsurance programs interest totaling 5 million associated with other additional debt and the writeoff of 2 million of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement in 2007 see footnote no 2 “income taxes” for additional information on the esop settlement the increase in interest on the programs we operate on behalf of the owners over the yearago period is attributable to higher liability balances and higher interest rates partially offsetting the 78 million interest expense increases over 2006 was an 18 million favorable variance to last year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects 

interest income provision for loan losses and income tax 

2008 compared to 2007 

interest income before the provision for loan losses increased by 1 million 3 percent to 39 million from 38 million in the prior year 

the provision for loan losses increased by 3 million 18 percent to 20 million from 17 million in the prior year the increase reflected provisions recorded in 2008 including a 22 million provision on a fully impaired loan see the “other charges” section of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” for more information and a 3 million loan loss provision associated with one property the unfavorable variance associated with the 2008 provisions was mostly offset by favorable variances associated with a 12 million provision recorded in 2007 related to one property a 5 million provision recorded in 2007 to write off the remaining exposure associated with our investment in a delta airlines lease and the reversal of 5 million of provisions in 2008 related to two previously impaired loans that were repaid for additional information regarding the delta airlines lease investment writeoff see the “investment in leveraged lease” caption later in this report 

our tax provision decreased by 91 million 21 percent to 350 million in 2008 from a tax provision of 441 million in 2007 and reflected the impact associated with lower pretax income in 2008 a 2007 charge for a german legislative tax change and 6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the esop settlement this decrease was partially offset by 39 million in higher deferred compensation costs in 2008 and a higher tax rate in 2008 the higher 2008 tax rate reflected 1 29 million of income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable us court of federal claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction 2 19 million of income tax expense due primarily to prior years’ tax adjustments including a settlement with the irs that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing transaction and 3 24 million of income tax expense related to the tax treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries that is in ongoing discussions with the irs 

2007 compared to 2006 

interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased by 11 million 22 percent to 38 million in 2007 from 49 million in 2006 primarily reflecting lower interest income associated with loans that have been repaid to us partially offset by the impact associated with new loan fundings 

loan loss provisions increased by 20 million versus the prior year primarily reflecting a 12 million charge associated with one property and a 5 million charge to write off our remaining exposure associated with our investment in a delta airlines lease versus loan loss reversals of 3 million in 2006 for additional information regarding the delta airlines lease investment writeoff see the “investment in leveraged lease” caption later in this report 

our tax provision increased by 61 million 16 percent to 441 million in 2007 from a tax provision of 380 million in 2006 and reflected higher pretax income from our lodging and timeshare segments as well as a higher tax rate in 2007 primarily reflecting both increased taxes associated with our international operations and a less favorable mix of taxable earnings between countries increased taxes also reflect a charge for a german legislative tax change in 2007 which had a onetime impact and 6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the esop settlement see footnote no 2 “income taxes” for additional information on the esop settlement 

  

equity in earnings losses 

2008 compared to 2007 

equity in earnings of 15 million in 2008 was unchanged from earnings of 15 million in 2007 and primarily reflected 14 million of increased earnings from a joint venture which sold portfolio assets in 2008 and had significant associated gains 10 million of favorable variances for three joint ventures that experienced losses due to startup costs in the prior year and 5 million of increased earnings from an international segment joint venture primarily reflecting insurance proceeds received by that joint venture in 2008 partially offset by an unfavorable 11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two international joint ventures operate an impairment charge of 9 million associated with one luxury segment joint venture under development and a 7 million impact related to contract cancellation allowances recorded at one timeshare segment joint venture see the “other charges” section of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” for more information on the impairment and contract cancellation allowances 

2007 compared to 2006 

equity in earnings increased by 12 million to earnings of 15 million from 3 million in 2006 and reflected the mix of investments compared to 2006 and stronger results at several joint ventures reflecting the strong lodging demand environment in 2007 for one joint venture the reopening of a hotel late in 2006 in mexico which had been closed following a hurricane in 2005 and strong demand in 2007 for our timeshare products in hawaii 

minority interest 

2008 compared to 2007 

minority interest increased by 14 million in 2008 to a 15 million benefit the minority interest benefit of 15 million is net of tax and reflected our partners’ share of losses totaling 24 million associated with joint ventures we consolidate net of our partners’ share of tax benefits of 9 million associated with the losses

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

statement of position 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued financial accounting standards “fas” no 152 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactionsan amendment of fasb statements no 66 and 67” and the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop 042 additionally the fasb amended fas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” and fas no 67 “accounting for costs and 

  

initial rental operations of real estate projects” to exclude accounting for real estate timesharing transactions from these statements we adopted sop 042 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter 

under sop 042 we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred we also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale we also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations which require us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs 

the adoption of sop 042 in 2006 which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of income resulted in a noncash aftertax charge of 109 million 025 per diluted share the pretax charge totaled 173 million and comprised a 130 million inventory writedown the establishment of a 25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of 18 million 

we estimate that for the 20year period from 2009 through 2028 the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately 35 billion 

business segments 

we are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the segments above in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses interest expense income taxes or indirect general administrative and other expenses with the exception of the timeshare segment we do not allocate interest income to our segments because note sales are an integral part of the timeshare segment we include note sale gains in our timeshare segment results we also include interest income associated with our timeshare segment notes in our timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that segment’s business additionally we allocate other gains and losses equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures divisional general administrative and other expenses and minority interests in income or losses of consolidated subsidiaries to each of our segments “other unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues general administrative and other expenses equity in earnings or losses and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments 

we aggregate the brands presented within our north american fullservice north american limitedservice international luxury and timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics types of customers distribution channels the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting structure 

  

total lodging and timeshare products by segment 

at yearend 2008 we operated or franchised the following properties by segment excluding 2332 corporate housing rental units associated with our execustay brand 

 

  

     

revenues 

 

 income from continuing operations 

 

 we allocate net minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries to our segments accordingly as of yearend 2008 we allocated net minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries as reflected in our consolidated statements of income as shown in the following table 

minority interest 

 

   

our business includes our north american fullservice north american limitedservice international luxury and timeshare segments we consider total segment revenues and total segment financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and results of our operations to those of other lodging companies 

2008 compared to 2007

 we currently have more than 125000 hotel rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development in our hotel development pipeline and we expect to add over 30000 hotel rooms to our system in 2009 

recent events including failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies have made the capital markets increasingly volatile accordingly given the difficult lending environment the company owners or franchisees may decide to reevaluate continuing some of the projects included in the development pipeline while the company has invested in few of its pipeline projects possible delays cancellations or financial restructurings of projects under development could have a negative impact on our financial results 

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to sell properties 

  

that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

in 2008 revpar for comparable companyoperated north american fullservice properties decreased by 16 percent to 12398 occupancy decreased by 20 percentage points to 703 percent and average daily rates increased by 12 percent to 17630 

the 59 million decrease in segment results compared to 2007 primarily reflected a 35 million decrease in incentive management fees and a 25 million decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses partially offset by a 2 million increase in base management and franchise fees 

the 35 million decrease in incentive management fees was in part due to the recognition in 2007 of business interruption insurance proceeds totaling 12 million associated with hurricane katrina and also reflected lower demand and propertylevel margins in 2008 compared to 2007 the slight increase of 2 million in base management and franchise fees was a product of unit growth and an additional week of sales mostly offset by lower revpar 

the decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses of 25 million primarily reflected an unfavorable 7 million impact associated with two properties undergoing renovations in 2008 8 million of losses associated with three properties one of which was a new property that opened in 2008 5 million of lower contract termination fees received 2 million of lower land rent income and an unfavorable 3 million impact associated with one property that was sold in 2007 and is now a managed property

the 23 million increase in segment results compared to 2006 reflects a 65 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees partially offset by a 22 million decline in gains and other income and a 20 million decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses 

the 65 million increase in fees was largely due to stronger revpar and propertylevel margins driven primarily by rate increases and productivity improvements incentive management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of 12 million and base management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of 2 million both of which were for business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricane katrina and no similar fees in 2006 additionally 2006 reflected the recognition of 3 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2006 compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2007 

gains and other income was 22 million lower in 2007 compared to 2006 and reflected a 37 million charge in 2006 associated with a straightline rent receivable partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of 25 million in 2006 and 34 million of lower other gains in 2007 compared to 2006 the 34 million decrease in other gains compared to the prior year reflects gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate while 2007 reflects limited similar activity owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by 20 million and reflected properties sold and 

  

10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2006 compared to 3 million of such fees received in 2007 general administrative and other expenses for 2007 were unchanged compared to 2006 primarily reflecting 5 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments in 2006 offset by a guarantee charge in 2007 associated with one property and the writeoff of a deferred contract acquisition cost associated with another property that left the system

the 10 million increase in base management and franchise fees was largely due to unit growth partially offset by a decrease in relicensing fees the 43 million decrease in incentive management fees was largely due to lower propertylevel revenue and margins and the recognition in 2007 of 15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2007 

the 14 million increase in general administrative and other expenses reflected a 15 million charge related to a shortfall funding under a guarantee see the “other charges” caption in footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” for more information the 13 million decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflected 6 million of franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007 which were primarily associated with fairfield inn brand properties that left our system and 7 million of lower income due to lower revenue and propertylevel margins associated with weaker demand at certain leased properties

in 2007 we recognized 15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior years’ results but not earned and due until 2007 compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2006 the additional increase in fees is largely due to higher revpar driven by rate increases which increased base management and franchise fees and to productivity improvements which increased propertylevel margins and incentive management fees additionally growth in the number of rooms contributed to the increase in base management and franchise fees the 5 million increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily a result of hotel franchise agreement termination fees of 6 million received in 2007 which were primarily associated with fairfield inn brand properties that left our system and 1 million of similar fees in 2006 the 11 million increase in general administrative and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects the impact of unit growth and development and the writeoff of 3 million of deferred contract acquisition costs

the increase in fees was largely due to higher revpar driven by rate increases and to a lesser extent reflected unit growth and cost control plans which increased propertylevel margins and incentive management fees 

the 32 million decrease in gains and other income in 2008 compared to 2007 reflected the recognition of gains totaling 9 million in 2008 compared to gains in 2007 of 41 million the 2007 gains primarily reflected a 10 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture and a gain totaling 23 million associated with sales of real estate the 15 million increase in general administrative and other expenses reflected higher wage and benefit costs and costs associated with unit growth and development 

joint venture equity results were lower than the prior year by 5 million primarily reflecting an unfavorable 11 million impact associated with tax law changes in a country in which two joint ventures operate partially offset by a 5 million favorable impact associated with insurance proceeds received by one of those same joint ventures

the 95 million decrease in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected 65 million of lower note sale gains in 2008 compared to 2007 mostly attributable to higher note sale volumes in 2007 42 million of lower residual interest accretion and 6 million of increased financing costs partially offset by 18 million of increased interest income lower note sale gains of 65 million reflected a 12 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to hedge ineffectiveness on note sale hedges and the 42 million of lower residual interest accretion reflected a 32 million charge in the 2008 fourth quarter related to the reduction in the valuation of residual interests due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which future cash flows were discounted to estimate the fair market value see the “other charges” caption of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” for more information regarding these charges in 2008 and 2007 we sold notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of 300 million and 520 million respectively the 34 million of lower reacquired and resales revenue net of expenses represented increased marketing and selling costs coupled with increased product cost relative to prior year 

the 28 million of restructuring costs represented 14 million in severance costs 9 million in development cancellations and 5 million in facility exit costs incurred as a result of restructuring initiatives at the segment see footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” for more information related to these initiatives and the costs incurred the 13 million increase in general administrative and other expenses reflected increased costs associated with wages and benefits joint venture equity earnings increased 1 million and reflected 10 million of startup losses incurred in 2007 for three joint ventures mostly offset by 7 million of contract cancellation allowances recorded at one joint venture in 2008 see the “other charges” caption of footnote no 20 “restructuring costs and other charges” for additional information and 3 million of lower earnings in 2008 at one joint venture 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with timeshare segment properties totaled 285 million in 2008 compared to 275 million in 2007 

  

2007 compared to 2006 

timeshare segment contract sales decreased by 14 percent compared to 2006 reflecting fewer residential and fractional sales partially offset by increased timeshare sales contract sales in 2006 reflected particularly strong joint venture residential sales associated with the launch of our san francisco and kapalua hawaii products 

the 225 million increase in timeshare segment revenues to 2065 million from 1840 million reflected a 170 million increase in timeshare sales and services revenue a 46 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue and 9 million of increased base management fees the increase in timeshare sales and services revenue primarily reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 and increased services and financing revenue higher base management fees reflect the growing number of timeshare resorts under management timeshare segment revenues include 50 million and 41 million of interest income for 2007 and 2006 respectively and note sale gains of 81 million and 77 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively recorded in our consolidated statements of income on the “timeshare sales and services” revenue line associated with timeshare segment notes receivable 

segment results of 306 million in 2007 increased by 26 million over 2006 and primarily reflected 9 million of increased base management fees 12 million of increased joint venture equity results and 11 million of lower general administrative and other expenses partially offset by 7 million of lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of expenses timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of 350 million decreased by 7 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses partially offset by the 15 million reversal of contingency reserves in 2006 and 4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 offset by several other projects that were approaching sellout the increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflected increased accretion interest income and higher note sale gains in 2007 compared to 2006 compared to the prior year the 12 million increase in joint venture equity results primarily reflected strong demand in 2007 for our products in kapalua hawaii and startup costs in 2006 associated with that joint venture the 11 million decrease in general administrative and other expenses reflected lower program and systems expenses in 2007 

cost reimbursements revenue and expenses associated with timeshare segment properties totaled 275 million in 2007 compared to 229 million in 2006 

investment in leveraged lease 

historically we had a 23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with delta airlines which we acquired in 1994 the gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income on september 14 2005 delta airlines filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease as a result our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately 17 million in 2005 and 1 million in 2006 we recorded an additional 5 million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007 and have no remaining exposure 

effective tax rate 

tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years as we exited the business in november 2007 our effective tax rate increased significantly thereby reducing our aftertax profits 

discontinued operations 

synthetic fuel 

the tax credits provided under internal revenue code section 45k were only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through december 31 2007 given high oil prices during 2007 and the anticipated and related phaseout of a significant portion of tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007 we permanently ceased operations at our synthetic fuel facilities on november 3 2007 and report this business as a discontinued operation see footnote no 3 “discontinued operationssynthetic fuel” in this report for additional information regarding the synthetic fuel segment 

2008 compared to 2007 

the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 1 million in 2008 and 352 million in 2007 income from the synthetic fuel segment totaled 3 million net of tax in 2008 compared to a loss of 1 million in 2007 income 

  

from the synthetic fuel segment of 3 million for 2008 primarily reflected the recognition in 2008 of additional tax credits as a result of the determination by the secretary of the treasury in 2008 of the reference price of a barrel of oil for 2007 partially offset by payments due to third parties based on the amount of additional tax credits 

2007 compared to 2006 

for 2007 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 352 million versus revenue of 165 million for the prior year primarily reflecting higher production in 2007 production in 2006 reflected production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices income from the synthetic fuel segment declined to a loss of 1 million in 2007 from income of 5 million in 2006 primarily reflecting increased operating losses associated with higher production in 2007 partially offset by increased revenue and increased tax credits associated with higher production and on the increased operating losses a higher tax benefit results for 2007 also reflect an estimated 707 percent phaseout of tax credits due to high oil prices versus a phaseout that was estimated at yearend 2006 to be 39 percent for 2006 additionally results in 2007 reflect interest costs of 8 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices 

sharebased compensation 

under our 2002 comprehensive stock and cash incentive plan we award 1 stock options to purchase our class a common stock “stock option program” 2 stock appreciation rights “sars” 3 restricted stock units of our class a common stock and 4 deferred stock units we grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant 

during 2008 we granted 56 million restricted stock units 26 million most of which were granted in february and had a weighted average grantdate fair value of 35 per unit and 30 million were granted in august and had a weighted average grantdate fair value of 26 per unit 27 million employee sars 18 million most of which were granted in february and had a weighted average grantdate fair value of 13 per right and 09 million were granted in august and had a weighted average grantdate fair value of 10 per right and 4000 nonemployee sars during that time period we also granted approximately 218000 stock options and issued 25000 deferred stock units the grants made in august would ordinarily have been made in february 2009 but were accelerated to encourage associate retention in a difficult economic climate awards for the most senior executives were not accelerated see footnote no 4 “sharebased compensation” later in this report for additional information 

new accounting standards 

eitf issue no 068 “applicability of the assessment of a buyer’s continuing investment under fasb statement no 66 for sales of condominiums” 

we adopted the fasb emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 068 “applicability of the assessment of a buyer’s continuing investment under fasb statement no 66 for sales of condominiums” “eitf 068” on december 29 2007 the first day of our 2008 fiscal year eitf 068 states that in assessing the collectibility of the sales price pursuant to paragraph 37d of financial accounting standards “fas” no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” “fas no 66” an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyer’s initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is collectible if an entity is unable to meet the criteria of paragraph 37 including an assessment of collectibility using the initial and continuing investment tests described in paragraphs 8 through 12 of fas no 66 then the entity should apply the deposit method of accounting as described in paragraphs 65 through 67 of fas no 66 

although our adoption of eitf 068 had no impact on our wholly owned projects in conjunction with the adoption of eitf 068 by one joint venture in which we are a partner we recorded the cumulative effect of applying eitf 068 as a reduction of 5 million to our investment in that joint venture an increase in deferred tax assets of 2 million and a reduction of 3 million to the opening balance of our retained earnings the application of the continuing investment criterion in eitf 068 on the collectibility of the sales price could in certain future circumstances delay our ability or the ability of joint ventures in which we are a partner to recognize revenues and costs using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting 

financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” 

we adopted fas no 157 “fair value measurements” “fas no 157” on december 29 2007 the first day of fiscal year 2008 fas no 157 defines fair value establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements on february 12 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” which amends fas no 157 by delaying its effective date by one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis therefore beginning on december 29 2007 

  

this standard applied prospectively to new fair value measurements of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on january 3 2009 the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year the standard will also apply to all other fair value measurements see footnote no 5 “fair value measurements” for additional information 

our servicing assets and residual interests which are measured using level 3 inputs which are described in footnote no 5 “fair value measurements” in the fas no 157 hierarchy accounted for 94 percent of the total fair value of our financial assets at yearend 2008 that are required to be measured at fair value using the guidance found in fas no 157 we treat the residual interests including servicing assets as trading securities under the provisions of fas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and accordingly we recorded realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the “timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our consolidated statements of income 

at the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period we estimate the fair value of our residual interests including servicing assets using a discounted cash flow model the implementation of fas no 157 did not result in material changes to the models or processes used to value these assets these transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest margin associated with the beneficial interest the discount rates we use in determining the fair values of the residual interests are based on the general level of interest rates in the market and the assumed credit risk of the interests retained we adjust these discount rates quarterly as interest rates and credit spreads in the market vary 

during 2008 we used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests including servicing assets at the date of sale average discount rate of 923 percent average expected annual prepayments including defaults of 2401 percent expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable excluding prepayments and defaults of 76 months and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable including prepayments and defaults of 35 months our key assumptions are based on experience with notes receivable and servicing assets 

the most significant estimate involved in the measurement process is the discount rate followed by the default rate and the loan repayment rate estimates of these rates are based on management’s expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates reflecting our historical experience industry trends current market interest rates expected future interest rates and other considerations actual repayment rates default rates and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative financing sources to borrowers if actual prepayments of the loans being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts if actual default rates or actual discount rates are lower than expected the carrying value of retained interests could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts if actual prepayments of the loans being serviced occur at a faster pace than we have projected the carrying value of servicing assets could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts if actual default rates or actual discount rates are higher than we expect the carrying value of retained interests could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts accordingly the retained interests including servicing assets actually realized could differ from the amounts initially recorded 

we completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual interests including servicing assets as of the end of 2008 to measure the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables this methodology applied unfavorable changes that would be statistically significant for the key variables of prepayment rate discount rate and weighted average remaining term before we applied any of these stress test changes we determined that the fair value of the residual interests including servicing assets was 221 million as of yearend 2008 

  

applying the stress tests we concluded that each change to a variable shown in the table below would have the following impact on the valuation of our residual interests at the end of 2008 

 

 we value our derivatives using valuations that are calibrated to the initial trade prices subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rates and volatilities we record realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments in gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable which are recorded within the “timeshare sales and services” revenue caption in our consolidated statements of income 

financial accounting standards no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilitiesincluding an amendment of fasb statement no 115” 

we adopted fas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilitiesincluding an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “fas no 159” on december 29 2007 the first day of our 2008 fiscal year this standard permits but does not require entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value we did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities in 2008 

eitf issue no 076 “accounting for sales of real estate subject to the requirements of fasb statement no 66 ‘accounting for sales of real estate’ when the agreement includes a buysell clause” 

we adopted eitf issue no 076 “accounting for sales of real estate subject to the requirements of fasb statement no 66 ‘accounting for sales of real estate’ when the agreement includes a buysell clause” “eitf 076” on december 29 2007 the first day of our 2008 fiscal year eitf 076 clarifies whether a buysell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under fas no 66 eitf 076 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit profit sharing leasing or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buysell clause performed in fiscal years 2008 and thereafter the adoption of eitf 076 did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

fasb staff position fas no 1404 and fin 46r8 “disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities” 

we adopted fasb staff position “fsp” fas no 1404 and fin 46r8 “disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities” in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal yearend fsp fas no 1404 and fin 46r8 amends fas no 140 to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transferors’ continuing involvements with transferred financial assets it also amends fin 46r to require public enterprises including sponsors that have a variable interest in a variable interest entity to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest entities the fsp also requires disclosures by a public enterprise that is a sponsor of a qualifying specialpurpose entity “spe” that holds a variable interest in the qualifying spe but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying spe and a servicer of a qualifying spe that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying spe but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying spe fsp fas no 1404 and fin 46r8 is effective for yearend 2008 disclosures the adoption of fsp fas no 1404 and fin 46r8 did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

fsp eitf 99201 “amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 9920 ‘recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets’” 

we adopted fsp eitf 99201 “amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 9920 ‘recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets’” “fsp eitf 99201” in conjunction with our 2008 fiscal yearend fsp eitf 99201 amends eitf issue no 9920 to align the impairment guidance in eitf issue 

  

no 9920 with that of fas no 115 fas no 115 measures impairment based on a determination of whether an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred our residual interests in our asset securitizations are recorded at fair value each reporting period therefore the adoption of fsp eitf 99201 did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

future adoption of accounting standards 

financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued fas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “fas no 141r” fas no 141r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations under fas no 141r an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisitiondate fair value with limited exceptions transaction costs will no longer be included in the measurement of the business acquired instead these costs will be expensed as they are incurred fas no 141r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements fas no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year 

financial accounting standards no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statementsan amendment of arb no 51” 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued fas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statementsan amendment of arb no 51” “fas no 160” fas no 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary specifically this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent’s equity the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement fas no 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in addition this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date fas no 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest fas no 160 must be applied prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented we are currently evaluating the impact that fas no 160 will have on our financial statements 

financial accounting standards no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activitiesan amendment of fasb statement no 133” 

in march 2008 the fasb issued fas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activitiesan amendment of fasb statement no 133” “fas no 161” fas no 161 requires enhanced disclosure related to derivatives and hedging activities and thereby seeks to improve the transparency of financial reporting under fas no 161 entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures relating to a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments b how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under fas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “fas no 133” and its related interpretations and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows fas no 161 must be applied prospectively to all derivative instruments and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and related hedged items accounted for under fas no 133 for all financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact that fas no 161 will have on our financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties we depend on capital to buy develop and improve hotels and to develop timeshare properties events over the past several months including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial services companies have made the capital markets increasingly volatile we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we also periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities obtain credit facilities from lenders or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

we are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement the “credit facility” that provides for borrowings and letters of credit and has supported our commercial paper program the credit facility provides for 25 billion of aggregate borrowings at any one time and expires on may 14 2012 borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a fixed spread additionally we pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating for additional information regarding our credit facility including participating financial institutions see exhibit 10 “amended and restated credit agreement” to our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on may 16 2007 

the credit facility contains certain covenants including a single financial covenant that limits the company’s maximum leverage defined in the credit agreement as adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda to not more than 4 to 1 our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments including being well within the limits under the credit facility leverage covenant and do not expect the covenants to restrict our ability to increase our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels should we need to do so in the future 

lehman commercial paper inc “lcpi” a subsidiary of lehmann brothers holdings inc which filed for bankruptcy on october 5 2008 is one of the lenders under the credit facility with a total aggregate funding commitment of 96 million 38 percent of the 25 billion in total commitments lcpi did not fund its share of our fourth quarter 2008 draws under the credit facility and we have no reason to expect that it will do so in the future accordingly the total current effective size of the credit facility is approximately 24 billion the loss of 96 million in effective capacity is not material to us and the credit facility together with cash we expect to generate from operations remains adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements 

at yearend 2008 our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1443 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of 2404 billion under our credit facility and our cash balance of 134 million less letters of credit outstanding totaling 126 million and less credit facility borrowings outstanding of 969 million we anticipate that this available capacity is adequate to fund our liquidity needs as noted above in addition as noted previously we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility’s covenants and accordingly expect undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility to remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate considerably more than we anticipate 

until early in the 2008 fourth quarter we regularly issued shortterm commercial paper primarily in the united states and to a much lesser extent in europe our commercial paper issuances are subject to the thencurrent demand for our commercial paper in each of these markets as we do not have purchase commitments from buyers disruptions in the financial markets in september 2008 significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market accordingly in september 2008 we borrowed under the credit facility to fund anticipated shortterm commercial paper maturities and to a lesser extent other general corporate needs including working capital and capital expenditures and suspended issuing commercial paper all of our previously issued commercial paper has matured and been repaid we anticipate issuing commercial paper when that market stabilizes and issuances can be made on favorable terms we classify commercial paper as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature fluctuations in the commercial paper market have not affected our liquidity and we do not expect them to do so in the future given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility 

  

in november 2008 standard  poor’s changed the outlook on our bbb credit rating to “negative” which resulted in an automatic downgrade in our commercial paper rating from a2 to a3 the market for a3 commercial paper is currently very limited this limited availability together with the higher interest costs associated with a3 issuances currently makes it difficult and expensive for us to access the commercial paper market any future downgrades of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or other similar rating agencies could increase our cost of capital we cannot assure you that downgrades will not occur in the future 

cash from operations 

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

 

 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 13 to 10 at yearend 2008 and 12 to 10 at yearend 2007 we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to this report are as follows 

 

 in response to significantly lower demand for our timeshare products we have correspondingly reduced our projected capital expenditures for 2009 while our timeshare segment historically generates positive operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash the following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare segment which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our timeshare segment as discussed in the second and third paragraphs following the table the turmoil in the credit markets hurt the asset securitization market in 2008 accordingly we completed only one note sale transaction in 2008 compared with two such transactions in each of 2006 and 2007 and accordingly note sale proceeds and note sale gains were both significantly lower in 2008 than in the prior two years 

 

 in june 2008 prior to the end of our second quarter we sold to a newly formed trust 300 million of notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products on the same day the trust issued 246 million of the trust’s notes in connection with the sale of notes receivable we received net proceeds of 237 million we retained residual interests with a fair value on the day of sale of 93 million we used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests including servicing assets at the date of sale average discount rate of 923 percent average expected annual prepayments including defaults of 2401 percent expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable excluding prepayments and defaults of 76 months and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable including prepayments and defaults of 35 months our key assumptions are based on our experience 

  

with timeshare segment notes receivable that we originate we recorded note sale gains totaling 16 million in 2008 which was net of a 12 million charge related to hedge ineffectiveness 

less favorable conditions in the asset securitization markets have reduced our gain from timeshare segment note sales during the past year as the trusts that purchased our mortgage notes have had to issue debt at higher relative interest rates and in the second quarter 2008 transaction we retained a larger residual interest in the trust for example in the 2008 second quarter note sale the trust that purchased our mortgage notes issued aaa rated asset backed notes at a spread of 325 basis points over the 3935 percent interest swap rate on libor compared to aaa note spreads of 100 basis points over the 4782 percent interest swap rate on libor for the 2007 fourth quarter note sale and 30 basis points over the 5192 percent interest swap rate on libor for the 2007 second quarter note sale in addition while the trusts in the fourth and second quarter 2007 securitizations each also issued 155 percent of the total principal amount of their asset backed notes at less than aaa ratings we believed that the market for lower rated notes during the second quarter of 2008 was insufficient to permit issuance of aa a and bbb rated notes at attractive spreads accordingly we decided to retain a larger residual interest in the trust for the second quarter 2008 transaction rather than having the trust offer lower rated notes given the further deterioration in the credit markets during the fourth quarter of 2008 we decided to postpone our planned note sale until 2009 

as of the date this annual report on form 10k is filed the securitization market remains extremely uncertain and very limited current demand for securitized loans makes that market much more difficult to access than it has been in the past we believe nonetheless that alternatives remain available to us to sell our timeshare notes record note sale gains and thereby reduce our timeshare notes receivable balances and improve our cash flow however we expect any transaction that we may be able to complete in the near term will be more costly to us and result in lower note sale gains if any relative to the size of the transaction than those we have experienced in previous years 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments we made capital expenditures of 357 million in 2008 671 million in 2007 and 529 million in 2006 that included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives timeshare segment development expenditures which are included in “cash from operations” as noted in that section are not reflected in these numbers capital expenditures decreased primarily due to a reduction in development spending we expect that nearterm capital expenditures will be lower than 2008 levels see the discussion of “development and financing risks” within the risk factors section of this document for possible impacts of this reduction over time we have sold lodging properties under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales if we were unable to do so our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions we also expect to continue to make other selective and opportunistic investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans and minority equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging and timeshare segments because 1 we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale 

dispositions property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 38 million in 2008 745 million in 2007 and 798 million in 2006 in 2008 we closed on the sales of two properties two land parcels and an interest in an entity that leases four hotels 

loan activity we have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel based on historical experience over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit loan collections and sales net of advances during 2008 and 2007 amounted to net loan advances of 17 million in 2008 and net loan collections and sales of 75 million in 2007 lodging senior loans outstanding totaled 2 million all of which was longterm at yearend 2008 and 7 million which included a current portion of 4 million at yearend 2007 lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled 236 million which included a current portion of 15 million at yearend 2008 and 206 million which included a current portion of 17 million at yearend 2007 in 2008 our notes receivable balance associated with lodging senior loans and lodging mezzanine and other loans increased by 25 million and primarily reflected the funding and collection of several loans offset by the reserve against one loan 

  

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 25 million in 2008 40 million in 2007 and 95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures 

cash from financing activities 

debt debt increased by 130 million in 2008 to 3095 million at yearend 2008 from 2965 million and reflected 969 million of borrowings under our credit facility mostly offset by the decrease in commercial paper outstanding of 585 million the repayment upon maturity of 91 million of series e senior notes in the 2008 first quarter repurchase of 109 million of senior notes across multiple series and other debt decreases of 54 million debt increased by 1132 million in 2007 to 2965 million at yearend 2007 from 1833 million due to the issuance of 346 million book value at issuance of series i senior notes described more fully in our 2007 annual report on form 10k the issuance of 397 million book value at issuance of series j senior notes described more fully in our 2007 annual report on form 10k a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of 270 million and other debt increases of 119 million 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2008 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 48 percent and an average maturity of approximately 46 years the ratio of fixedrate longterm debt to total longterm debt was 07 to 10 at yearend 2008 at the end of 2008 we had longterm public debt ratings of bbb from standard and poor’s and baa2 from moody’s 

see the “cash requirements and our credit facilities” caption within this “liquidity and capital resources” section for additional information on our credit facility 

in 2008 we repurchased in the open market 109 million of our senior notes across multiple series the debt extinguishment resulted in a gain of 28 million that was recorded for the difference between the purchase price of 77 million and the respective carrying amount of 105 million of the debt 

share repurchases we purchased 119 million shares of our class a common stock in 2008 at an average price of 3118 per share 410 million shares of our class a common stock in 2007 at an average price of 4332 per share and 415 million shares of our class a common stock in 2006 at an average price of 3813 per share we purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of 2008 as of yearend 2008 213 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our board of directors we do not expect share repurchase activity in 2009 

dividends in april 2008 our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 17 percent to 00875 per share dividends of 115 million were paid in 2008 a 10 percent increase over 2007

in the normal course of the hotel management business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow

 critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them 

marriott rewards 

marriott rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program marriott rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations purchases of timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential products and to a lesser degree through participation in affiliated partners’ programs such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies points which we track on members’ behalf can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations airline tickets airline frequent flyer program miles rental cars and a variety of other awards however points cannot be redeemed for cash we provide marriott rewards as a marketing program to participating properties we charge the cost of operating the program including the estimated cost of award redemption to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures 

we defer revenue received from managed franchised and marriottownedleased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation we determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed these judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points 

our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program including marketing promotion communication with and performing member services for the marriott rewards members due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the marriott rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed we recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded upon the redemption of points we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset we evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur we record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is greater than its estimated fair value 

  

loan loss reserves 

lodging senior loans and lodging mezzanine and other loans 

we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows that assumes certain growth projections that may or may not occur or the estimated fair value of the collateral we apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy when we determine that a loan is impaired we recognize interest income on a cash basis at yearend 2008 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 157 million we had a 113 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses leaving 44 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses at yearend 2007 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 112 million we had a 92 million allowance for credit losses leaving 20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses during 2008 and 2007 our average investment in impaired loans totaled 135 million and 102 million respectively 

loans to timeshare owners 

in accordance with the adoption of sop 042 in 2006 we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale we assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable we estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable from 2004 to the current year we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the life of those notes at yearend 2008 and yearend 2007 our allowance for credit losses associated with “loans to timeshare owners” totaled 35 million and 19 million respectively 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances 

income taxes 

we record the current year amounts payable or refundable as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 

changes in existing tax laws and rates their related interpretations as well as the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 

other matters 

inflation 

inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses

other activities 

marriott golf manages 44 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners 

we operate 14 systemwide hotel reservation centers eight in the united states and canada and six in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others 

additionally we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ® best rate guarantee which assures customers that they won’t find cheaper rates than those available through our telephone reservation system our web site or any other marriott reservation channel our 

  

strong marriott rewards loyalty program and our informationrich and easytouse wwwmarriottcom web site all encourage customers to make reservations using the marriott web site our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective with almost 3000 hotels economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and maximize our fee revenue 

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising there are approximately 770 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2007 approximately twothirds of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is fairly concentrated with the six largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have a 9 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties 

while service excellence is marriott’s hallmark we continually look for new ways to delight our guests currently we are focused on elevating the marriott experience beyond that of a traditional hotel stay to a total guest experience that encompasses exceptional style personal luxury and superior service this approach to hospitality “the new look and feel of marriott now” is influenced by the world’s foremost innovations in design technology culinary expertise service and comfort this evolution can be seen across all of our brands in new and stylish hotel designs luxurious bedding exotic destinations worldclass spas and fitness centers and inspired cuisine each brand from luxury to moderately priced will be more upscale and attuned to customer needs than ever before 

our at your service ® program focuses on the total guest experience from point of reservation to checkout as part of the prearrival planning service guests receive a personalized email prior to checkin that includes local transportation weather and restaurant information as well as directions and maps at a growing number of hotels and resorts service has been expanded to include a “virtual concierge” guests are able to reserve spa treatments room service for delivery upon arrival and other amenities specific to each property guests may also request complimentary amenities such as extra pillows miniature refrigerators and early checkin or late checkout we have also streamlined the travel planning and booking process with the addition of marriott flexrez to at your service in addition to booking hotel rooms on wwwmarriottcom  our online customers can now find competitive airfare and car rental rates there as well 

  

the vacation ownership industry is one of the fastest growing segments in hospitality and is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies since entering the timeshare industry over 20 years ago we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide competition in the timeshare interval fractional and residential business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts trust in the brand the pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits such as exchange programs we believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences combined with our financial strength diverse market presence strong brands and wellmaintained properties will enable us to remain competitive approximately 40 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners 

marriott rewards is a frequent guest program with over 28 million members and nine participating marriott brands the marriott rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 29 participating airline programs we believe that marriott rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2007 over 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by marriott rewards members in addition the ability of timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into marriott rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brand 

discontinued operations 

synthetic fuel 

our synthetic fuel operation consisted of four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” because tax credits under section 45k of the irc are not available for the production and sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar yearend 2007 and because high oil prices during 2007 will result in the phaseout of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007 on november 3 2007 we shut down the facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel accordingly we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation the book value of the facilities was zero at yearend 2007 as the facilities have been transferred to third parties under the site leases for the facilities we were required to restore the leased premises to substantially the condition the premises were in when the leases were originally executed however we executed agreements with the lessors of the sites pursuant to which we transferred the facilities to the lessors in exchange for the release of our obligations to restore the leased premises to their original conditions costs associated with shutting down the synthetic fuel operation and transferring the facilities to the site lessors were not material 

employee relations 

at yearend 2007 we had approximately 151000 employees approximately 8700 of which were represented by labor unions we believe relations with our employees are positive 

environmental compliance 

our compliance with laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and discharge of hazardous materials has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position and we do not anticipate any material impact from such compliance in the future

 item 1a risk factors tableend forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the company and its financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

lodging industry risks 

the lodging industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for customers we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas this could limit our operating margins diminish our market share and reduce our earnings 

we are subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel timeshare and corporate apartment industries the profitability of the hotels vacation timeshare resorts and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand or the prices we are able to obtain for hotel rooms timeshare units residential units and corporate apartments or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profit of our lodging businesses reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans guarantees and minority equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage even where such factors do not reduce demand our profit margins may suffer if we are unable to fully recover increased operating costs from our customers 

the uncertain environment in the lodging industry will continue to impact our financial results and growth both the company and the lodging industry were hurt by several events occurring over the last several years including the global economic downturn the terrorist attacks on new york and washington in september 2001 the global outbreak of sars in 2003 and military action in iraq although by 2007 both the lodging and travel industries had recovered from the depressed levels during those years recent concerns over the possibility of an economic slowdown have left it unclear whether the recent growth environment will continue accordingly our financial results and growth could be harmed if the industry recovery stalls or is reversed 

operational risks 

our new branded hotel products may not be successful we recently announced two new branded hotel products nickelodeon resorts by marriott ® and edition and may launch additional branded hotel products in the future we cannot assure that these brands will be accepted by hotel owners potential franchisees or the traveling public that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing the brands or that the brands will be successful in addition each of these new brands involves cooperation andor consultation with a third party including some shared control over product design and development sales and marketing and brand standards disagreements between us and these third parties regarding areas of consultation or shared control could slow the development of these new brands andor impair marriott’s ability to take actions it believes to be advisable for the success and profitability of such brands 

our lodging operations are subject to international national and regional conditions because we conduct our business on a national and international platform our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies in recent years our business was hurt by decreases in travel resulting from recent economic conditions the military action in iraq and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future economic performance is similarly subject to the uncertain economic environment in the united states and other regions the resulting unknown pace of business travel and the occurrence of any future incidents in the countries where we operate 

risks relating to natural disasters contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues so called “acts of god” such as hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters and the spread of contagious diseases such as avian flu and sars in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers can cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty can have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

we may have disputes with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may be subject to interpretation and may give rise to disagreements in some instances we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but have not always been able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has in the past resulted in litigation and could do so in the future 

damage to or other potential losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of insurance coverage that we can obtain and our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

  

development and financing risks 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

we depend on capital to buy and maintain hotels and hotel owners or we may be unable to access capital when necessary in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and maintenance of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control our ability to recover loan and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from owners through the proceeds of hotel sales refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital in addition downgrades of our public debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar companies could increase our cost of capital 

further volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to sell the loans that our timeshare business generates our timeshare business provides financing to purchasers of our timeshare and fractional properties and we periodically sell interests in those loans in the securities markets while we do not believe that recent volatility in the credit markets will prevent us from continuing to sell those notes on attractive terms  further volatility could cause future sale terms to be materially less favorable to us or prevent us from selling our timeshare notes entirely which in turn would reduce future gains and could result in increased borrowings to provide capital to replace anticipated proceeds from such sales 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks we develop new hotel timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties our involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 construction delays cost overruns or so called “acts of god” such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations 2 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for projects that are not pursued to completion 3 conditions within capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or development of future properties and 4 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to changes in mortgage rates market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate 

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs impair project operations or increase project completion risks partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties that are associated with our lodging and timeshare properties or brands may reduce our profits in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate through minority interests andor licensing fees in the development and sale of residential properties associated with 

  

our brands including luxury residences and condominiums under our ritzcarlton and marriott brands such projects pose additional risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging and timeshare businesses which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 

 

  

  

 technology information protection and privacy risks 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position the lodging and timeshare industries continue to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards program and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis if we are unable to do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet reservation services could adversely impact our revenues  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as expediacom ®  travelocitycom ®  and pricelinecom ®  serving both the leisure and increasingly the corporate travel and group meeting sectors while marriott’s look no further ® best rate guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of these internet travel intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels these intermediaries continue their attempts to commoditize hotel rooms by aggressively marketing to pricesensitive travelers and corporate accounts and increasing the importance of general indicators of quality such as “threestar downtown hotel” at the expense of brand identification these agencies hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their travel services rather than to our lodging brands although we expect to continue to maintain and even increase the strength of our brands in the online marketplace if the amount of sales made through internet intermediaries increases significantly our business and profitability may be harmed 

failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions damage of reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers as they are entered into processed by summarized by and reported by our various information systems we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of that customer employee and company data is critical to us if that data is not accurate or complete we could make faulty decisions our customers also have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding both in the us and other international jurisdictions in which we operate a significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses fines and litigation 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively our timeshare segment and to a lesser extent our other lodging segments rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the telemarketing sales rule canspam act and various us state laws or new federal laws regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing email and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if the acquisition of these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

  

other risks 

if we cannot attract and retain talented associates our business could suffer we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel if we are not able to recruit train develop and retain sufficient numbers of talented associates we could experience increased associate turnover decreased guest satisfaction low morale inefficiency or internal control failures insufficient numbers of talented associates could also limit our ability to grow and expand our businesses 

delaware law and our governing corporate documents contain and our board of directors could implement antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts under the delaware business combination statute a stockholder holding 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock could not acquire us without board of director’s consent for at least three years after the date the stockholder first held 15 percent or more of the voting stock our governing corporate documents also among other things require supermajority votes in connection with mergers and similar transactions in addition our board of directors could without stockholder approval implement other antitakeover defenses such as a stockholder rights plan to replace the existing stockholder’s rights plan that will expire in march 2008 and which we do not presently plan to renew

generally lodging demand remained strong through 2007 driven by continued strength associated with worldwide business travel in general luxury international and fullservice properties experienced stronger demand than limitedservice properties strong demand enabled us to increase rates at the property level which resulted in solid yearoveryear revpar increases revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more profitable business such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business this strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers yielded strong yearoveryear average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines in addition group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2007 2006 and 2005 

continuing operations 

revenues 

2007 compared to 2006 

revenues increased by 995 million 8 percent to 12990 million in 2007 from 11995 million in 2006 as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide base management and franchise fees increased by 116 million as a result of stronger revpar and unit growth as we opened 203 properties 29200 rooms throughout 2007 in 2006 we recognized 5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2006 versus no similar fees in 2007 incentive management fees increased by 88 million due to stronger revpar and propertylevel margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements incentive management fees included 17 million and 10 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized furthermore incentive management fees for 2007 included 13 million and base management fees for 2007 included 6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to 1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006 stronger catering food and beverage spa and other profits also drove propertylevel margins higher yearoveryear revpar increases were driven primarily by rate increases 

timeshare sales and services revenue increased by 170 million 11 percent in 2007 over the prior year the increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds in 2006 some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007 the increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue 

owned leased corporate housing and other revenue increased by 121 million 11 percent the increase largely reflected stronger revpar and the mix of owned and leased properties in 2007 as compared to 2006 and to a lesser extent higher fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate offset by the recognition of 19 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007 as compared to the recognition of 26 million of such fees in 2006 

the 995 million increase in total revenue includes 500 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue to 8575 million in 2007 from 8075 million in the prior year this revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income the increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage we added 15 managed properties 4870 rooms and 138 franchised properties 15963 rooms to our system in 2007 net of properties exiting the system 

2006 compared to 2005 

revenues increased by 866 million 8 percent to 11995 million in 2006 from 11129 million in 2005 as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide base management and franchise fees increased by 117 million as a result of stronger revpar and unit growth in 2006 we recognized 5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2006 incentive management fees increased by 80 million due to stronger revpar and propertylevel margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements incentive management fees include 10 million and 14 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized stronger catering food and beverage spa and other profits also drove propertylevel margins higher yearoveryear revpar increases were driven primarily by rate increases owned and leased revenue increased significantly primarily as a result of our purchase early in the second half of 2005 of 13 formerly managed properties from ctf holdings ltd “ctf” see footnote no 8 “acquisitions and dispositions” later in this report for a detailed description of the ctf transaction as planned eight of the ctf properties were sold during 2006 one property was sold in the first quarter five properties were sold in the second quarter and two properties were sold in the third quarter 

  

timeshare sales and services revenue increased by 90 million 6 percent over the prior year the increase largely reflects 77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains as detailed later in the “cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” narrative note securitization gains of 69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue but instead are a component of gains and other income additionally financing and services revenue increased in 2006 versus the prior year as did villa rental revenue partially offsetting these increases development revenue declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sellout 

the 866 million increase in total revenue includes 404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue to 8075 million in 2006 from 7671 million in the prior year the increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases we added 13 managed properties 4126 rooms and 77 franchised properties 11286 rooms to our system in 2006 net of properties exiting the system 

operating income 

2007 compared to 2006 

operating income increased by 101 million 9 percent to 1188 million in 2007 from 1087 million in the prior year the increase in operating income reflects stronger combined base management incentive management and franchise fees of 204 million partially offset by higher general administrative and other expenses of 91 million lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of 7 million and lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses of 5 million 

the combined base management incentive management and franchise fees increase of 204 million reflected strong revpar growth unit growth and propertylevel margin improvements and favorable exchange rates worldwide in 2006 we recognized 5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2006 versus no similar fees in 2007 incentive management fees included 17 million and 10 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized furthermore incentive management fees for 2007 included 13 million and base management fees included 6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to 1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006 

as compared to the yearago period general administrative and other expenses increased by 91 million 13 percent from 677 million in 2006 to 768 million in 2007 in 2007 we incurred a 35 million charge related to excise taxes associated with the settlement of issues raised during the internal revenue service and department of labor examination of our employee stock ownership plan “esop” feature of our employees’ profit sharing retirement and savings plan and trust the “plan” see footnote no 3 “income taxes” for additional information on the esop settlement additionally the increase was attributable to among other things increased costs related to our unit growth development and systems improvements increased litigation expenses and increased other administrative costs also unfavorably impacting general administrative and other expenses when compared to the prior year were foreign exchange losses totaling 2 million in 2007 as compared to foreign exchange gains of 6 million in 2006 and 1 million of guarantee charges in 2007 while the yearago period reflected 6 million of guarantee reversals partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were 4 million of lower hotel operating agreement performance cure payments in 2007 as compared to 2006 and a 9 million reversal in 2007 of reserves that were no longer required increased legal expenses in 2007 include charges associated with litigation and other legal matters of the 91 million increase in total general administrative and other expenses an increase of 13 million was attributable to our lodging segments and a 78 million increase was unallocated 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses of 350 million decreased by 7 million as compared to the prior year primarily reflecting flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs and 12 million of increased financing revenue net of financing expenses more than offset by the reversal in 2006 of 15 million reversal of contingency reserves and 4 million of lower services revenue net of services expenses flat development revenue net of product costs and marketing and selling costs reflected newer projects that reached reportability thresholds in 2007 offset by several other projects that were approaching sellout the increase in financing revenue net of financing costs primarily reflects increased accretion interest income and higher note sale gains in 2007 as compared to 2006 

the 5 million decrease in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses reflected 19 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2007 as compared to 26 million in 2006 depreciation charges totaling 8 million were recorded in 2007 associated with one owned 

  

property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” during 2007 as compared to depreciation charges recorded in 2006 of 7 million associated with two properties that were reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses was the favorable impact of 4 million associated with both the stronger demand environment in 2007 and the impact of the sale and purchase of several properties 

2006 compared to 2005 

operating income increased by 388 million 56 percent to 1087 million in 2006 from 699 million in the prior year the increase in 2006 is in part due to a combined base management franchise and incentive management fee increase of 197 million reflecting stronger revpar growth unit growth and propertylevel margin improvements stronger owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses contributed 17 million of the improvement in operating income and reflected the strong demand environment in 2006 and the impact of the ctf hotel properties acquired in 2005 the 17 million improvement in 2006 versus the prior year reflects increased owned and leased results of 20 million a 12 million increase in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received and 5 million of higher other income partially offset by 20 million of lower land lease income also reflected in the yearoveryear change in owned and leased results are depreciation charges totaling 7 million recorded in 2006 associated with two properties that were reclassified in 2006 from “held for sale” to “held and used” the depreciation charges totaling 7 million represented the amount that would have been recognized had the two properties been continuously classified as “held and used” 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses increased by 98 million 38 percent in 2006 and largely reflects 77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains as noted earlier in the “revenue” discussion note securitization gains of 69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue but instead are a component of gains and other income also reflected in the 98 million favorable variance development revenue net of expenses increased by 14 million and financing services and other revenue net of expenses increased by 7 million increased development revenue net of expenses primarily reflects lower development expenses associated with projects in 2006 in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with statement of position 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” “sop 042” implemented in 2006 increased financing services and other revenue net of expenses reflects a 15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves in 2006 

as compared to the yearago period general administrative and other expenses decreased by 76 million 10 percent to 677 million in 2006 from 753 million in 2005 in 2005 we incurred general administrative and other expenses of 94 million primarily due to the noncash writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements resulting from the ctf transaction we also incurred general administrative and other expenses of 30 million in 2005 associated with our bedding incentive program we implemented the bedding incentive program in the 2005 second quarter to help ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by yearend 2005 further impacting general administrative and other expenses 2005 reflected hotel operating agreement performance cure payments of 15 million versus a 6 million similar payment in 2006 and 2005 also reflected 9 million of guarantee charges associated with three properties versus the reversal of an additional 5 million of guarantee charges in 2006 additionally impacting the yearoveryear general administrative and other expenses variance were foreign exchange gains totaling 6 million in 2006 as compared to losses of 5 million in 2005 also impacting the yearoveryear change in general administrative and other expenses an additional 22 million reflects unit growth systems improvements higher program and joint venture development expenses and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits development expenses and deferred compensation expenses were higher in 2006 by 15 million and 5 million respectively as noted under the heading “new accounting standards” in the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section of our 2006 form 10k we adopted a new accounting standard in 2006 associated with sharebased compensation this new standard resulted in incremental general administrative and other expenses of 39 million versus 2005 primarily impacting the unallocated portion of our general administrative and other expenses of the 76 million decrease in total general administrative and other expenses a decrease of 124 million was attributable to our lodging segments and a 48 million increase was unallocated

interest expense 

2007 compared to 2006 

interest expense increased by 60 million 48 percent to 184 million for 2007 from 124 million in 2006 of the 60 million increase over 2006 78 million was due to 26 million of higher interest reflecting a higher outstanding commercial paper balance primarily due to increased share repurchases and the esop settlement payments and related interest rates 25 million of interest associated with our series h senior notes issuance which occurred late in 2006 and our series i and series j senior notes issuances which occurred in 2007 a charge of 13 million in 2007 related to the esop settlement charges totaling 53 million and 46 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf including marriott rewards gift certificates and selfinsurance programs interest totaling 5 million associated with other additional debt and the write off of 2 million of deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement in 2007 see footnote no 3 “income taxes” for additional information on the esop settlement the increase in interest on the programs we operate on behalf of the owners over the yearago period is attributable to higher liability balances and higher interest rates partially offsetting the 78 million interest expense increases over 2006 was an 18 million favorable variance to last year for higher capitalized interest associated with construction projects 

2006 compared to 2005 

interest expense increased by 18 million 17 percent to 124 million in 2006 from 106 million in 2005 included within interest expense for 2006 and 2005 are charges totaling 46 million and 29 million respectively relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf the increase in interest on these programs over 2005 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates interest expense also increased in 2006 due to our june 2005 series f notes issuance our june 2006 series h notes issuance and higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff at maturity of both our series d notes in april 2005 and series b notes in november 2005 and the exchange of our series c and series e notes for lower interest rate series g notes in 2005 

  

interest income provision for loan losses and income tax 

2007 compared to 2006 

interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased by 11 million 22 percent to 38 million in 2007 from 49 million in 2006 primarily reflecting lower interest income associated with loans that have been repaid to us partially offset by the impact associated with new loan fundings 

loan loss provisions increased by 20 million versus the prior year primarily reflecting a 12 million charge associated with one property and a 5 million charge to write off our remaining exposure associated with our investment in a delta airlines inc “delta” lease versus loan loss reversals of 3 million in 2006 for additional information regarding the delta lease investment writeoff see the “investment in leveraged lease” caption later in this report 

our tax provision increased by 61 million 16 percent from a tax provision of 380 million in 2006 to a tax provision of 441 million in 2007 and reflected higher pretax income from our lodging segments as well as a higher tax rate in 2007 primarily reflecting both increased taxes associated with our international operations and a less favorable mix of taxable earnings between countries increased taxes also reflect a charge for a german legislative tax change in 2007 which had a onetime impact and 6 million of taxes in 2007 associated with additional interest on the esop settlement see footnote no 3 “income taxes” for additional information on the esop settlement 

2006 compared to 2005

our tax provision totaled 380 million in 2006 compared to a tax provision of 284 million in 2005 the difference of 96 million is attributable to higher taxes in 2006 associated with higher pretax income from our lodging operations 

equity in earnings 

2007 compared to 2006 

equity in earnings increased by 12 million from 3 million in 2006 to 15 million in 2007 and reflected the mix of investments compared to 2006 and stronger results at several joint ventures reflecting the strong lodging demand environment in 2007 for one joint venture the reopening of a hotel late in 2006 in mexico which had been closed following a hurricane in 2005 and strong demand in 2007 for our timeshare products in hawaii 

2006 compared to 2005 

the 33 million decline from earnings of 36 million in 2005 to earnings of 3 million in 2006 attributable to our equity investments reflected the recognition in 2005 of 30 million of equity earnings from the sale of hotels by three equity joint ventures in which we had equity interests in addition since 2005 we have sold several equity joint ventures 

income from continuing operations 

2007 compared to 2006 

compared to 2006 income from continuing operations decreased by 15 million 2 percent to 697 million in 2007 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 010 6 percent to 175 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “operating income” the decrease versus the prior year is due to higher general administrative and other expenses 91 million higher taxes 61 million higher interest expense 60 million higher loan loss provision 20 million lower interest income 11 million lower timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 7 million and lower owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 5 million partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were higher fee income 204 million higher gains and other income 23 million higher equity investment results 12 million and a higher minority interest benefit 1 million

compared to 2005 income from continuing operations increased by 169 million 31 percent to 712 million in 2006 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 048 41 percent to 165 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “operating income” the increase versus the prior year is due to higher fee income 197 million higher timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 98 million lower general administrative and other expenses 76 million a lower loan loss provision 31 million higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 17 million and lower minority interest expense 2 million partially offsetting these favorable variances were significantly higher taxes 96 million lower gains and other income 75 million lower equity investment results 33 million lower interest income 30 million and higher interest expense 18 million 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

statement of position 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued financial accounting standards “fas” no 152 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactionsan amendment of fasb statements no 66 and 67” and the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop 042 additionally the fasb amended fas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” and fas no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” to exclude accounting for real estate timesharing transactions from these statements we adopted sop 042 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter 

under sop 042 we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred we also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale we also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs 

the adoption of sop 042 in 2006 which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of income resulted in a noncash aftertax charge of 109 million 025 per diluted share the pretax charge totaled 173 million and comprised a 130 million inventory writedown the establishment of a 25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of 18 million 

we estimate that for the 20year period from 2008 through 2027 the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately 17 billion 

business segments 

we are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the segments above in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations 

  

in addition to the brands noted above in 2007 we announced our new brand of familyfriendly resorts and spas “nickelodeon resorts by marriott” and a new brand of lifestyle boutique hotels “edition” at yearend 2007 no properties were yet open under either brand 

in 2006 we analyzed our internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency and as part of this process we evaluated the impact on segment reporting accordingly we now report five operating segments and no longer allocate indirect administrative expenses to our segments we reflect this revised segment reporting throughout this report for all periods presented and present historical figures in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting see also the form 8k that we filed on march 19 2007 furnishing quarterly revenues and income from continuing operations for each of 2006 and 2005 in the new segment format 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses interest expense indirect general administrative and other expenses or income taxes with the exception of the timeshare segment we do not allocate interest income to our segments because note sales are an integral part of the timeshare segment we include note sale gains in our timeshare segment results we include interest income associated with timeshare segment notes in our timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that segment’s operations we also allocate other gains or losses as well as equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general administrative and other expenses to each of our segments “other unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues general administrative and other expenses equity in earnings or losses and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments 

we aggregate the brands presented within our north american fullservice north american limitedservice international luxury and timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics types of customers distribution channels the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting structure 

  

total lodging products by segment 

at yearend 2007 we operated or franchised the following properties by segment excluding 2156 corporate housing rental units 

 

  

     

revenues 

 

 our business includes our north american fullservice north american limitedservice international luxury and timeshare segments we consider total segment revenues and total segment financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and results of our operations to those of other lodging companies 

we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties we calculate revpar by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues 

companyoperated house profit margin is the ratio of propertylevel gross operating profit also known as house profit to total propertylevel revenue this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce propertylevel profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control gross operating profit includes room food and beverage and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses as well as repairs and maintenance utility general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees furniture fixtures and equipment replacement reserves insurance taxes or other fixed expenses 

  

2007 compared to 2006 

we added 203 properties 29200 rooms and 55 properties 9722 rooms exited the system in 2007 not including residential products we also added three residential properties 347 units 

total segment financial results increased by 173 million 12 percent to 1588 million in 2007 from 1415 million in 2006 and total segment revenues increased by 979 million to 12909 million in 2007 an 8 percent increase from revenues of 11930 million in 2006 the results as compared to the prior year reflect a 204 million 17 percent increase in combined base management franchise and incentive management fees from 1224 million in 2006 to 1428 million in 2007 a 16 million increase in earnings associated with equity investments and a 1 million minority interest benefit partially offsetting these favorable variances was a decrease of 18 million in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 13 million of increased general administrative and other expenses a decrease of 10 million in gains and other income and a decrease of 7 million in timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses

we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to sell properties that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

the 23 million increase in segment results compared to 2006 reflects a 65 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees partially offset by a 22 million decline in gains and other income and a 20 million decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses 

the 65 million increase in fees was largely due to stronger revpar and propertylevel margins driven primarily by rate increases and productivity improvements incentive management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of 12 million and base management fees for 2007 reflect the receipt of 2 million both of which were for business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricane katrina and no similar fees in 2006 additionally 2006 reflected the recognition of 3 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2006 compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2007 

gains and other income was 22 million lower in 2007 as compared to 2006 and reflected a 37 million charge in 2006 associated with a straightline rent receivable partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of 25 million in 2006 and 34 million of lower other gains in 2007 as compared to 2006 the 34 million decrease in other gains compared to the prior year reflects gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate while 2007 reflects limited similar activity owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by 20 million and reflected properties sold and 10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees received in 2006 compared to 3 million of such fees received in 2007 general administrative and other expenses for 2007 were unchanged as compared to 2006 primarily reflecting 5 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments in 2006 offset by a guarantee charge in 2007 associated with one property and the writeoff of a deferred contract acquisition cost associated with another property that left the system

compared to the prior year our 2006 results reflect a 59 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees the increase in fees is largely due to stronger revpar driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent higher food and beverage meeting room rental and other revenue and productivity improvements all of which favorably impacted propertylevel house profit margins the growth in the number of rooms yearoveryear also contributed to the increase in fees incentive management fees included 10 million for 2005 that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings but not earned and due until they were recognized similarly base management fees for 2006 included 4 million of fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results but not earned and due until 2006 owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased by 8 million primarily as a result of properties sold in 2006 and the receipt in 2005 of a 10 million hotel agreement termination fee associated with one property partially offset by the receipt in 2006 of 10 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees 

  

general administrative and other expenses decreased by 69 million as a result of among other things a 60 million charge in 2005 associated with the ctf transaction more fully discussed in the previous “operating income” discussion as well as expenses of 14 million in 2005 related to our bedding incentive program partially offset by increased expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development systems improvements and increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits in 2005 general administrative and other expenses included 3 million of hotel management agreement performance cure payments associated with one property in 2006 general administrative and other expenses included a 5 million hotel management agreement performance cure payment 

gains and other income was 3 million higher than the prior year and reflected the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of 25 million in 2006 and 15 million of higher net gains and other income in 2006 reflecting gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate that were partially offset by lower gains in 2006 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties gains and other income for 2006 reflected a 37 million noncash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value associated with land we own and lease as further described in the “expected land sale” caption in the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section of our 2006 form 10k equity results decreased by 19 million versus the prior year and reflected the recognition in 2005 of 16 million in equity earnings from two joint ventures as a result of the ventures’ sale of hotels and our sale of some joint venture investments in 2005 and 2006 offset to some extent by improved equity joint venture results reflecting the stronger demand environment

in 2007 we recognized 15 million of incentive management fees that were calculated based on prior years’ results but not earned and due until 2007 as compared to the recognition of no similar fees in 2006 the additional increase in fees is largely due to higher revpar driven by rate increases which increased base management and franchise fees and to productivity improvements which increased propertylevel margins and incentive management fees additionally growth in the number of rooms contributed to the increase in base management and franchise fees the 5 million increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily a result of hotel franchise agreement termination fees of 6 million received in 2007 which were associated with properties primarily our fairfield inn brand that left our system and 1 million of similar fees in 2006 the 11 million increase in general administrative and other expenses in 2007 primarily reflects the impact of unit growth and development and the writeoff of 3 million of deferred contract acquisition costs

the 77 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a 77 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees 27 million of lower general administrative and other expenses and 6 million of increased equity results partially offset by a 14 million decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses and a 19 million decrease in gains and other income the increase in fees is largely due to higher revpar driven by rate increases which impacted propertylevel house profits and to a lesser extent to 2006 productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms stronger performance at our renovated courtyard properties versus nonrenovated properties also contributed to the increase in segment results over the prior year the decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects lower lease revenue as a result of our sale late in 2005 of a portfolio of land underlying 75 courtyard hotels partially offset by improved owned and leased results in 2006 reflecting stronger demand 

the decrease in general administrative and other expenses of 27 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling 11 million associated with our bedding incentive program a 6 million litigation charge and a 3 million guarantee charge improved equity results in 2006 versus 2005 reflect the impact of a stronger demand environment in 2006 new joint ventures and the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the courtyard joint venture through the first quarter of 2005 versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter for additional information regarding the courtyard joint venture see the “courtyard joint venture” caption in the “liquidity and capital resources” section in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our 2005 form 10k gains and other income decreased by 19 million in 2006 as a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land that generated gains and other income of 17 million a 10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity to us of the loan we made to the courtyard joint venture partially offset by higher other real estate and other gains of 4 million in 2006 and increased income of 4 million in 2006 associated with cost method joint ventures

for 2007 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 352 million versus revenue of 165 million for the prior year primarily reflecting higher production in 2007 production in 2006 reflected production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices income from the synthetic fuel segment declined from 5 million in 2006 to a loss of 1 million in 2007 primarily reflecting increased operating losses associated with higher production in 2007 partially offset by increased revenue and increased tax credits associated with higher production and on the increased operating losses a higher tax benefit results for 2007 also reflect an estimated 7071 percent phaseout of tax credits due to high oil prices versus a phaseout that was estimated at yearend 2006 to be 39 percent for 2006 additionally results in 2007 reflect interest costs of 8 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices 

2006 compared to 2005 

for 2006 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 165 million versus revenue of 421 million for the prior year primarily reflecting significantly lower production in 2006 as a result of production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices income from the synthetic fuel segment declined from 125 million in 2005 to 5 million in 2006 primarily as a result of both lower production in 2006 and the estimated 39 percent phaseout of tax credits at yearend 2006 due to high oil prices in 2006 additionally results in 2006 reflect interest costs of 4 million associated with hedges entered into in response to high oil prices segment results for 2006 also reflect a 5 million charge reflecting the writedown of assets at the alabama production facility as the adjacent mine was closed at yearend and we did not anticipate operating the facility again at this location 

distribution services 

in 2005 we had income net of tax of 1 million associated with the distribution services business that we exited in 2002 

new accounting standards 

fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” 

we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” on december 30 2006 the first day of our 2007 fiscal year fin 48 is an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which seeks to standardize practices associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return additionally fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition under fin 48 an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold we recorded the cumulative effect of applying fin 48 of 155 million as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and additional paidincapital on december 30 2006 the first day of our 2007 fiscal year see footnote no 3 “income taxes” for additional information 

financial accounting standards no 156 “accounting for servicing of financial assetsan amendment of fasb statement no 140” 

we adopted fasb’s fas no 156 on december 30 2006 the first day of our 2007 fiscal year fas no 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities initially be measured at fair value if practicable it also allows an entity to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities we recorded the cumulative effect of applying fas no 156 of 1 million net of tax as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on december 30 2006 see footnote no 11 “asset securitizations” for additional information 

future adoption of accounting standards 

eitf issue no 068 “applicability of the assessment of a buyer’s continuing investment under fasb statement no 66 accounting for sales of real estate for sales of condominiums”

percentage of completion method eitf 068 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after march 15 2007 which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year the cumulative effect of applying eitf 068 if any will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption we do not expect the impact of adoption of eitf 068 to be material 

fas no 157 “fair value measurements” 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas no 157 “fair value measurements” “fas no 157” this standard defines fair value establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements fas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year provisions of fas no 157 must be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which fas no 157 is applied in november 2007 the fasb agreed to partially defer the effective date for one year of fas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis we are currently evaluating the impact that fas no 157 will have on our financial statements 

financial accounting standards no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” 

in february 2007 the fasb issued fas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “fas no 159” this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after november 15 2007 which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year we do not expect to elect the fair value measurement option for any financial assets or liabilities at the present time 

eitf issue no 076 “accounting for sales of real estate subject to the requirements of fasb statement no 66 ‘accounting for sales of real estate’ when the agreement includes a buysell clause” 

in december 2007 the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 076 “accounting for sales of real estate subject to the requirements of fasb statement no 66 ‘accounting for sales of real estate’ when the agreement includes a buysell clause” “eitf 076” eitf 076 clarifies whether a buysell clause is a prohibited form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under fas no 66 eitf 076 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit profitsharing leasing or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buysell clause performed in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year we do not expect eitf 076 to have a material impact on our financial statements 

financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued fas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “fas no 141r” fas no 141r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations under fas no 141r an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisitiondate fair value with limited exceptions fas no 141r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements fas no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact that fas no 141r will have on our financial statements 

financial accounting standards no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statementsan amendment of arb no 51” 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued fas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statementsan amendment of accounting research bulletin “arb” no 51” “fas no 160” fas no 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary specifically this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent’s equity the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement fas no 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in addition this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date fas no 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the 

  

parent and its noncontrolling interest fas no 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact that fas no 160 will have on our financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

we are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings and letters of credit and supports our commercial paper program on may 14 2007 we amended and restated this facility to increase the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from 2 billion to 25 billion and extended the expiration of the facility from 2011 to 2012 the material terms of the amended and restated credit agreement were otherwise unchanged borrowings under the facility bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread based on our public debt rating additionally we pay annual fees on the facility at a rate also based on our public debt rating we do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility we classify commercial paper as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

at yearend 2007 our available borrowing capacity amounted to 2151 billion and reflected borrowing capacity of 25 billion under the credit facility plus our cash balance of 332 million less letters of credit outstanding totaling 96 million and less 585 million of outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility we consider these resources together with cash we expect to generate from operations adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements we periodically evaluate opportunities to issue and sell additional debt or equity securities obtain credit facilities from lenders or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

we issue shortterm commercial paper in the united states and in europe our commercial paper issuances are subject to the thencurrent demand for our commercial paper in each of these markets as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper 

cash from operations 

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

 

 our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 12 to 10 at yearend 2007 and 13 to 10 at yearend 2006 we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover we also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital 

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to this report are as follows 

 

   

while our timeshare segment generates strong operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash the following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare segment which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our timeshare segment 

 

 our ability to sell timeshare segment notes is dependent upon continued liquidity within the assetbacked and broader structured credit markets while the recent dislocation in the capital markets has resulted in a general reduction in liquidity for new assetbacked issuances we believe that demand remains sufficient for our continued sale of timeshare segment notes albeit at somewhat less favorable terms if the liquidity of the markets decreases further or the underlying quality of any future timeshare segment notes we originate were to deteriorate we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales although we do not expect such deterioration 

investing activities cash flows 

capital expenditures and other investments capital expenditures of 671 million in 2007 529 million in 2006 and 780 million in 2005 included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives timeshare segment development expenditures which are included in “cash from operations” as noted in that section’s narrative are not reflected in these numbers over time we have sold lodging properties under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales if we were unable to do so our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions we also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans and minority equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging segments because 1 we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale 

at the end of 2007 we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential interests subsequent to yearend 2007 we purchased our partner’s interest in the joint venture concurrent with this transaction we purchased additional land from our partner as well cash consideration for this transaction totaled 37 million and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling 74 million and 37 million respectively on the date of purchase 

dispositions property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 745 million in 2007 798 million in 2006 and 298 million in 2005 in 2007 we closed on the sales of 13 properties and five joint venture investments cash proceeds of 90 million for a parcel of land sold in 2007 are not reflected in the 745 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency accordingly these proceeds impacted the “other investing activities” section of our consolidated statements of cash flows rather than “dispositions” 

loan activity we have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel based on historical experience over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit loan collections and sales net of advances during 2007 amounted to 75 million lodging senior loans outstanding totaled 

  

7 million which included a current portion of 4 million at yearend 2007 and 9 million which included a current portion of 1 million at yearend 2006 lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled 206 million which included a current portion of 18 million at yearend 2007 and 268 million which included a current portion of 32 million at yearend 2006 in 2007 our notes receivable balance associated with lodging senior loans and lodging mezzanine and other loans declined by 64 million and primarily reflects the repayment or sale of several loans and the reserve against an underperforming loan 

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 40 million in 2007 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in two joint ventures cash outflows of 95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in three joint ventures cash outflows of 216 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in 2005 of a 5050 joint venture with whitbread plc “whitbread” for additional information regarding whitbread see footnote no 10 “marriott and whitbread joint venture” in our 2006 form 10k 

cash from financing activities 

debt debt increased by 1132 million in 2007 from 1833 million to 2965 million at yearend 2007 due to the issuance of 346 million book value at issuance of series i senior notes described more fully below the issuance of 397 million book value at issuance of series j senior notes described more fully below a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of 270 million and other debt increases of 119 million debt increased by 96 million in 2006 from 1737 million to 1833 million at yearend 2006 due to the issuance of 349 million book value at issuance of series h senior notes partially offset by a net reduction in commercial paper outstanding of 184 million and other debt decreases of 69 million 

in 2007 we issued 350 million of aggregate principal amount of 6375 percent series i senior notes due 2017 the offering of the notes closed on june 25 2007 we received net proceeds before expenses of approximately 346 million from this offering after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering we used these proceeds for general corporate purposes including the repayment of commercial paper borrowings interest on these notes will be paid on june 15 and december 15 of each year and commenced on december 15 2007 the notes will mature on june 15 2017 and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note

both the series i senior notes and the series j senior notes were issued under an indenture with the bank of new york successor to jpmorgan chase bank na formerly known as the chase manhattan bank as trustee dated as of november 16 1998 

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2007 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 60 percent and an average maturity of approximately 59 years the ratio of fixedrate longterm debt to total longterm debt was 08 to 10 at yearend 2007 at the end of 2007 we had longterm public debt ratings of bbb from standard and poor’s and baa2 from moody’s 

subsequent to yearend 2007 on january 15 2008 we made a 94 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire at maturity all of our outstanding series e senior notes 

share repurchases we purchased 410 million shares of our class a common stock in 2007 at an average price of 4332 per share 415 million shares of our class a common stock in 2006 at an average price of 3813 per share and 514 million shares of our class a common stock in 2005 at an average price of 3212 per share we purchase shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions as of yearend 2007 332 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our board of directors

furthermore in addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding table we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of 586 million payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture which is

in addition to the guarantees described above in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions 

in addition to the guarantees noted previously as of yearend 2007 we had extended approximately 4 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties under which we expect to fund approximately 2 million within one year we do not expect to fund the remaining 2 million of commitments which expire after five years

in the normal course of the hotel management business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow 

  

related party transactions

the following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties 

income statement data 

 

 critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them 

  

marriott rewards 

marriott rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program marriott rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations purchases of timeshare interval fractional ownership and residential products and to a lesser degree through participation in affiliated partners’ programs such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies points which we track on members’ behalf can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations airline tickets airline frequent flyer program miles rental cars and a variety of other awards however points cannot be redeemed for cash we provide marriott rewards as a marketing program to participating properties we charge the cost of operating the program including the estimated cost of award redemption to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures 

we defer revenue received from managed franchised and marriottownedleased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation we determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed these judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points 

our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program including marketing promotion communication with and performing member services for the marriott rewards members due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the marriott rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed we recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded upon the redemption of points we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset we evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur we record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value 

loan loss reserves 

lodging senior loans and lodging mezzanine and other loans 

we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows that assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur or the estimated fair value of the collateral we apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy where we determine that a loan is impaired we recognize interest income on a cash basis at yearend 2007 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 112 million we had a 92 million allowance for credit losses leaving 20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses at yearend 2006 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 92 million we had a 70 million allowance for credit losses leaving 22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses during 2007 and 2006 our average investment in impaired loans totaled 102 million and 138 million respectively 

loans to timeshare owners 

in accordance with the adoption of sop 042 in 2006 we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale we assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable we estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past three years we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the life of those notes at yearend 2007 and yearend 2006 our allowance for credit losses associated with “loans to timeshare owners” totaled 19 million and 29 million respectively 

  

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances 

income taxes 

we record the current year amounts payable or refundable as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 

changes in existing laws and rates and their related interpretations and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 

other matters 

inflation 

inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses

 other activities 

marriott golf manages 45 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners 

we operate 16 systemwide hotel reservation centers 10 in the united states and canada and six in other countries and territories which handle reservation requests for marriott lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others 

additionally we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further ® best rate guarantee which gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our web site or any other reservation channel our strong marriott rewards loyalty program and our informationrich and easytouse wwwmarriottcom web site all encourage customers to make reservations using the marriott web site we have control over our inventory and pricing and utilize online and offline agents where cost effective with over 2800 hotels economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and maximize our fee revenue 

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from their management or franchise contracts similar to thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

competition 

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising there are approximately 676 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2006 approximately twothirds of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is fairly concentrated with the five largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

based on lodging industry data we have an 88 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and we estimate less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our 

  

hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings these ongoing refurbishment programs along with periodic brand initiatives are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties 

while service excellence is marriott’s hallmark we continually look for new ways to delight our guests currently we are focused on elevating the marriott experience beyond that of a traditional hotel stay to a total guest experience that encompasses exceptional style personal luxury and superior service this approach to hospitality “the new look and feel of marriott now” is influenced by the world’s foremost innovations in design technology culinary expertise service and comfort this evolution can be seen across all of our brands in new and stylish hotel designs luxurious bedding exotic destinations worldclass spas and fitness centers and inspired cuisine each brand luxury or moderately priced will be more upscale and attuned to customer needs than ever before 

our at your service ® program focuses on the total guest experience from point of reservation to checkout as part of the prearrival planning service guests receive a personalized email prior to checkin that includes local transportation weather and restaurant information as well as directions and maps at a growing number of hotels and resorts the service has been expanded to include a “virtual concierge” guests are able to reserve spa treatments room service for delivery upon arrival and other amenities specific to each property guests may also request complimentary amenities that each property offers such as extra pillows miniature refrigerators and early checkinlate checkout we also streamlined the travel planning and booking process with the addition of marriott flexrez to at your service in addition to booking hotel rooms on wwwmarriottcom  our online customers can now also find competitive airfare and car rental rates as well 

the vacation ownership industry is one of the fastest growing segments in hospitality and is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies since entering the timeshare industry in 1984 we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide competition in the timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts trust in the brand the pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits such as exchange programs we believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences combined with our financial strength diverse market presence strong brands and wellmaintained properties will enable us to remain competitive approximately 38 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners 

marriott rewards is a frequent guest program with approximately 26 million members and nine participating marriott brands the marriott rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 27 participating airline programs we believe that marriott rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2006 over 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by marriott rewards members in addition the ability of timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into marriott rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brand 

synthetic fuel 

operations 

our synthetic fuel operation currently consists of four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” two of which are located at a coal mine in saline county illinois one of which is located at a coal mine in jefferson county alabama and one of which is located at a coal mine near evansville indiana three of the four plants are held in one entity synthetic american fuel enterprises ii llc “safe ii” and one of the plants is held in a separate entity synthetic american fuel enterprises i llc “safe i” section 45k of the irc provides tax credits for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through 2007 credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007 although the facilities incur significant losses these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under section 45k of the irc which reduce our income tax expense during 2006 the indiana facility was relocated from alabama the relocation of the plant was completed in the 2006 third quarter in late february 2006 an explosion occurred at our alabama feedstock supplier’s underground coal mine several months following the explosion the mine was 

  

reopened with a limited amount of production however at yearend 2006 the mine was again closed by our feedstock supplier as a result of the mine closure production at the one plant remaining in alabama was suspended at yearend 2006 

at each of our locations the synthetic fuel operation has site leases at sites that are adjacent to large mines and in the case of our alabama operation a barge loadout facility on a navigable river in addition at each of the locations the synthetic fuel operation has coal purchase agreements with the owners of the adjacent coal mines and synthetic fuel sales contracts with a number of major utilities including the tennessee valley authority and tampa electric company with respect to the illinois location the synthetic fuel operation has agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel through 2007 covering at least 50 percent of the annual productive capacity of the facilities at that location from time to time the illinois synthetic fuel operation supplements these base contracts as opportunities arise by entering into spot contracts to buy coal and sell synthetic fuel to different end users with respect to the indiana location the synthetic fuel operation has entered into agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel to a number of major utilities through the end of 2007 the agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel can generally be canceled by us in the event that we choose not to operate the facilities or if the synthetic fuel produced at the facilities does not qualify for tax credits under section 45k of the irc or in the event of a phaseout of tax credits under section 45k of the irc 

although we anticipate that the coal mines adjacent to the synthetic fuel operation’s production sites in illinois and indiana will be able to fulfill those facilities’ requirements for feedstock coal if our feedstock suppliers become unable to supply the illinois and indiana facilities with enough coal to satisfy our requirements for any reason we would have to curtail production which would have a negative impact on our results of operations or negotiate new coal supply agreements with third parties which might not be available on similar terms in addition the synthetic fuel operation has synthetic fuel sale contracts with a number of customers who have contracted to purchase in excess of 10 percent of the productive capacity at our alabama illinois and indiana locations although we expect that those customers could be replaced by other purchasers we cannot assure that we would be able to enter into replacement contracts on equivalent terms as a result the failure by one or more of those customers to perform their purchase obligations under those sale contracts could have a material adverse effect on the synthetic fuel operation 

the synthetic fuel operation has an operations and maintenance agreement with an experienced manager of synthetic fuel facilities this manager is responsible for staffing the facilities operating and maintaining the machinery and conducting routine maintenance on behalf of the synthetic fuel operation finally the synthetic fuel operation has a license and binder purchase agreement with headwaters incorporated which permits the operation to utilize a carboxylated polystyrene copolymer emulsion patented by headwaters and manufactured by dow chemical that is mixed with coal to produce a qualified synthetic fuel 

as discussed in greater detail below in item 1a “risk factors” the tax credits available under section 45k of the irc for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given year are phased out if oil prices in that year are above certain thresholds as a result of high oil prices in the first several weeks of 2006 we elected to suspend production of synthetic fuel in midjanuary 2006 on february 17 2006 we restarted production and entered into hedge agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur from that date through march 31 2006 if more than a majority of the tax credits were phased out in 2006 as a result of high oil prices 

early in the 2006 second quarter with oil prices again averaging well above the starting point of the projected 2006 phaseout range for the first few months of the year we suspended all production at our synthetic fuel facilities in order to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits were phased out in 2006 we restarted production early in the 2006 fourth quarter at all four of the synthetic fuel production facilities and entered into hedge agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits were phased out in 2006 however as noted earlier in this section at yearend the mine adjacent to our alabama production facility was again closed by our feedstock supplier and we did not anticipate operating the facility again at this location as a result of new information received in 2007 we may attempt to restart the alabama facility in the future or move the processing equipment to another location late in 2006 and early in 2007 we entered into hedge agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits are phased out in 2007 we will continue to monitor the situation and if circumstances warrant we may again elect to suspend production at all of our synthetic fuel facilities in the future 

because the tax credits under section 45k of the irc are only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal through 2007 we expect to permanently shut down the facilities and cease production of synthetic fuel at the end of 2007 the book value of the synthetic fuel facilities was 5 million at yearend 2006 under the site leases for the facilities we are required to restore the leased premises to substantially the condition the premises were in when the leases were executed this restoration may include the dismantling and sale or disposal of improvements we have constructed on the premises as well as site restoration and other related tasks 

  

we expect that the costs associated with shutting down the synthetic fuel facilities and completing the restoration of the project sites will not be material 

our investment 

we acquired our initial interest in safe i and safe ii from pacificorp financial services “pacificorp” in october 2001 for 46 million in cash and we began operating the facilities in the first quarter of 2002 we also make annual payments to pacificorp based on the amount of tax credits produced up to a certain threshold 

on june 21 2003 we sold an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in both safe i and safe ii we received cash and promissory notes totaling 25 million at closing and were entitled to receive additional proceeds based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser as a result of a put option associated with the june 21 2003 sale of a 50 percent ownership interest we consolidated the two synthetic fuel joint ventures from that date through november 6 2003 effective november 7 2003 because the put option was voided we began accounting for the synthetic fuel joint ventures using the equity method of accounting beginning march 26 2004 as a result of adopting fin 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” we again consolidated the synthetic fuel joint ventures and we reflected our partner’s share of the operating losses as minority interest 

on october 6 2004 we entered into amendment agreements with our synthetic fuel partner that resulted in a shift in the allocation of tax credits between us our partner increased its allocation of tax credits generated by the safe i synthetic fuel facility from approximately 50 percent to 90 percent through march 31 2005 and paid a higher price per tax credit to us for that additional share of tax credits effective april 1 2005 our partner’s share of the tax credits from safe i returned to approximately 50 percent also on october 6 2004 our partner reduced its allocation of tax credits generated by the three safe ii synthetic fuel facilities from approximately 50 percent to roughly 8 percent through december 31 2004 and to 1 percent from january 1 2005 through may 31 2005 effective june 1 2005 our partner’s share of the tax credits from the safe ii facilities returned to approximately 50 percent 

our partner in safe ii which owns three of our synthetic fuel plants exercised its option to have its interest in safe ii redeemed effective december 31 2005 the first day of our 2006 first quarter as a result we now own all of the interests in the three safe ii production facilities in consideration for the redeemed interest we forgave the remaining outstanding promissory note balance of approximately 8 million related to our partner’s initial purchase of the interest in safe ii and our partner was relieved of the obligation to make further earnout payments with respect to safe ii for periods after december 31 2005 on that date we eliminated our partner’s minority interest in safe ii which was 7 million as a result of the redemption of our partner’s interest in safe ii for the period beginning january 1 2006 we were allocated 100 percent of the operating losses associated with the facilities owned by safe ii received 100 percent of the tax credits generated by those facilities and made production decisions with respect to those facilities based on our 100 percent ownership 

effective october 1 2006 we purchased our partner’s interest in safe i and as a result we now own all of the interests in the one safe i production facility in consideration for the purchased interest we paid our partner 150000 in cash and for periods after september 30 2006 released our partner from its obligation to make remaining base note and earnout payments related to the partner’s purchase of the interest in safe i on september 30 2006 we eliminated our partner’s minority interest in safe i which was 2 million as a result of the purchase of our partner’s interest in safe i for the period beginning october 1 2006 we were allocated 100 percent of the operating losses associated with the facility owned by safe i received 100 percent of the tax credits generated by that facility and made production decisions with respect to that facility based on our 100 percent ownership in connection with the acquisition of our partner’s interest in safe i we also assumed the obligation of our partner to make earnout payments to our prior partner from whom it acquired the safe i interest in 2005 

internal revenue service determinations 

on november 7 2003 the united states internal revenue service “irs” issued private letter rulings to the synthetic fuel joint ventures confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the facilities is a “qualified fuel” under the internal revenue code and that the resulting tax credit may be allocated among the members of the synthetic fuel joint ventures in july 2004 irs field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment and later a summary report to pacificorp that included a challenge to the placedinservice dates of the three safe ii synthetic fuel facilities one of the conditions to qualify for tax credits is that the production facility must have been placed in service before july 1 1998 on june 7 2005 the irs national office issued a technical advice memorandum confirming that the three safe ii synthetic fuel facilities that were under irs review met the placedinservice requirement of the internal revenue code

 item 1a risk factors tableend forwardlooking statements 

we make forwardlooking statements in this report see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations which follow under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the company and its financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

the lodging industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for customers we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas this could limit our operating margins diminish our market share and reduce our earnings 

we are subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel timeshare and corporate apartment industries the profitability of the hotels vacation timeshare resorts and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand or the prices we are able to obtain for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profit of our lodging businesses reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans guarantees and minority equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage even where such factors do not reduce demand our profit margins may suffer if we are unable to fully recover increased operating costs from our customers 

  

the uncertain pace and duration of the current growth environment in the lodging industry will continue to impact our financial results and growth both the company and the lodging industry were hurt by several events occurring over the last several years including the global economic downturn the terrorist attacks on new york and washington in september 2001 the global outbreak of sars in 2003 and military action in iraq although both the lodging and travel industries have now largely recovered from the depressed levels during those years the duration pace and full extent of the current growth environment remains unclear accordingly our financial results and growth could be harmed if that recovery stalls or is reversed 

our lodging operations are subject to international national and regional conditions because we conduct our business on a national and international platform our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies in recent years our business was hurt by decreases in travel resulting from recent economic conditions the military action in iraq and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future economic performance is similarly subject to the uncertain economic environment in the united states and other regions the unknown pace of business travel that results and the occurrence of any future incidents in the countries where we operate 

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations renew agreements or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today 

we may have disputes with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may in some instances be subject to interpretation and may give rise to disagreements we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but have not always been able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has in the past resulted in litigation and could do so in the future 

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

we depend on capital to buy and maintain hotels and we or hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and maintenance of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control our ability to recover loan and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from owners through the proceeds of hotel sales refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital in addition downgrades of our public debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar companies could increase our cost of capital 

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks we develop new hotel timeshare interval fractional ownership and whole ownership properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties our involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 construction delays cost overruns or acts of god such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations 2 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for projects that are not pursued to completion 3 conditions within capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or development of future properties and 4 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to changes in mortgage rates market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices we anticipate 

  

development activities that involve our coinvestment with third parties may further increase completion risk or result in disputes that could increase project costs or impair project operations partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion 

risks associated with development and sale of residential properties that are associated with our lodging and timeshare properties or brands may reduce our profits in certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate through minority interests andor licensing fees in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands including luxury residences and condominiums under our the ritzcarlton and marriott brands such projects pose additional risks beyond those generally associated with our lodging and timeshare businesses which may reduce our profits or compromise our brand equity including the following 

 

  

  

  

 damage to or other potential losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise may not be covered by insurance we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of insurance coverage that we can obtain and our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

risks relating to acts of god contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues acts of god such as hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters and the spread of contagious diseases such as avian flu and sars in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers can cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging actual or threatened war terrorist activity political unrest civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty can have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our profits 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position the lodging and timeshare industries continue to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including those used for our reservation revenue management and property management systems our marriott rewards program and technologies we make available to our guests these technologies and systems must be refined updated andor replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis if we are unable to do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 

  

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet reservation services could adversely impact our revenues  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as travelocitycom ® expediacom ® and pricelinecom ® serving both the leisure and increasingly the corporate travel and group meeting sectors while marriott’s look no further ® best rate guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of these internet travel intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our hotels these intermediaries continue their attempts to commoditize hotel rooms by aggressively marketing to pricesensitive travelers and corporate accounts and increasing the importance of general indicators of quality such as “threestar downtown hotel” at the expense of brand identification these agencies hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their travel services rather than to our lodging brands although we expect to continue to maintain and even increase the strength of our brands in the online marketplace if the amount of sales made through internet intermediaries increases significantly our business and profitability may be harmed 

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively our timeshare segment and to a lesser extent our other lodging segments rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings any further restrictions in laws such as the telemarketing sales rule canspam act and various us state laws regarding marketing and solicitation or international data protection laws that govern these activities could result in concern about the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing email and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products we also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other company’s marketing materials if the acquisition of these lists were outlawed or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

operating risks at our synthetic fuel operations could reduce the tax benefits generated by those facilities the company owns four synthetic fuel production facilities the internal revenue code provides tax credits for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through 2007 although our synthetic fuel facilities incur significant losses those losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated which reduce our income tax expense problems related to supply production and demand at any of the synthetic fuel facilities the power plants and other end users that buy synthetic fuel from the facilities the suppliers of the treatment agent or the coal mines from which the facilities buy coal could diminish the productivity of our synthetic fuel operations and adversely impact the ability of those operations to generate tax credits 

high oil prices in 2007 could reduce or eliminate the tax credits generated by our synthetic fuel facilities the tax credits available under the internal revenue code for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given year are phased out if the reference price of a barrel of oil for that year falls within a specified price range the “reference price” of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil and is determined for each calendar year by the secretary of the treasury by april 1 of the following year in 2004 and 2005 the reference price was approximately equal to 89 percent of the average price in those years of the benchmark nymex futures contract for a barrel of light sweet crude oil the price range within which the tax credit is phased out was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation in 2005 the phaseout range was 5320 to 6679 because the reference price for a barrel of oil for 2005 was below that range at 5026 there was no reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2005 

assuming a 2 percent inflation adjustment factor for 2006 and assuming that the ratio of the reference price to the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract remains approximately the same in 2006 as it was in 2005 we currently estimate that there was a 39 percent reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2006 assuming a 2 percent inflation adjustment factor for each of 2006 and 2007 and assuming the ratio of the reference price to the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract remains the same in 2007 as it was in 2005 we currently estimate that the tax credits available for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in 2007 would begin to be phased out if the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract in 2007 exceeds approximately 6219 and would be fully phased out if the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract in 2007 exceeds approximately 7808 the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract for 2007 through february 9 2007 was approximately 5549 

we cannot predict with any accuracy the future price of a barrel of oil if the reference price of a barrel of oil in 2007 exceeds the applicable phaseout threshold the tax credits generated by our synthetic fuel facilities could be reduced or eliminated which would have a negative impact on our results of operations late in 2006 and early in 2007 we entered into hedging agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits are phased out in 2007 

  

our effective tax rate is likely to increase significantly after the synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of 2007 tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years because that program ends with 2007 synthetic fuel production our facilities will not be able to generate credits in future years as a result our future effective tax rate is likely to increase significantly thereby reducing our aftertax profits

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend business and overview 

we are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2832 hotels and related facilities our operations are grouped into six business segments north american fullservice lodging north american limitedservice lodging international lodging luxury lodging timeshare and synthetic fuel in our lodging business we operate develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 68 countries and territories we also operate and develop marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names 

we earn base incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare segment 1 selling timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership properties 2 operating the resorts and 3 financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals in addition we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own and lease and we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel operations 

generally lodging demand remained robust through 2006 driven by continued strength associated with business and leisure travelers while lodging supply growth continued to remain low at the property level these factors enabled us to increase rates and improve revenue mix which resulted in strong yearoveryear revpar increases revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more profitable business such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business this deliberate strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers yielded strong yearoveryear average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines rates have also increased as stronger demand enabled us to reduce available discounts and special rates in addition group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates 

demand for our brands is strong in most markets around the world and the weak us dollar continues to drive international travelers into the united states for our north american properties revpar increases in 2006 as compared to the year ago period were particularly strong in new york boston atlanta chicago dallas houston los angeles and seattle across the us demand also strengthened in many smaller city and suburban markets during 2006 internationally revpar increases in 2006 versus the prior year were particularly strong in china mexico australia the united kingdom the middle east the netherlands france and germany 

our brands are strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest satisfaction the worldwide presence and quality of our brands our marriott rewards loyalty program an informationrich and easytouse web site a multichannel central reservations system and desired property amenities including meeting and banquet facilities fitness centers spas awardwinning restaurants and highspeed and wireless internet access we along with owners and franchisees continue to invest in our brands by means of both new and renovated properties new room and public space designs enhanced amenities and technology offerings

consolidated results 

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2006 2005 and 2004 

continuing operations 

revenues 

2006 compared to 2005 

revenues increased 5 percent to 12160 million in 2006 from 11550 million in 2005 as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide partially offset by a decline in revenue associated with our synthetic fuel operation base management and franchise fees increased 117 million as a result of stronger revpar and unit growth in 2006 we recognized 5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior period 

  

results but not earned and due until 2006 incentive management fees improved 80 million due to stronger revpar and propertylevel margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements incentive fees include 10 million and 14 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized stronger catering food and beverage spa and other profits also drove propertylevel margins higher yearoveryear revpar increases were driven primarily by rate increases owned and leased revenue increased significantly primarily as a result of our purchase early in the second half of 2005 of 13 formerly managed properties from ctf holdings ltd “ctf” see footnote no 8 “acquisitions and dispositions” later in this report for a detailed description of the ctf transaction as planned eight of the ctf properties were sold during 2006 one property was sold in the 2006 first quarter five properties were sold in the 2006 second quarter and two properties were sold in the 2006 third quarter 

timeshare sales and services revenue increased 90 million 6 percent over the prior year the increase largely reflects 77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains as detailed later in the “cumulative effect of change in accounting principle” narrative note securitization gains of 69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue but instead are a component of gains and other income additionally financing and services revenue increased in 2006 versus the prior year as did villa rental revenue partially offsetting these increases development revenue declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sellout as compared to 2005 synthetic fuel revenue was significantly lower in 2006 primarily due to the suspensions of production in 2006 as a result of high oil prices synthetic fuel production resumed in the fourth quarter of 2006 

the 5 percent increase in total revenue includes 404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue to 8075 million in 2006 from 7671 million in the prior year this revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income the increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases we added 13 managed properties 4126 rooms net and 77 franchised properties 11286 rooms net to our system in 2006 

2005 compared to 2004 

revenues increased 14 percent to 11550 million in 2005 from 10099 million in 2004 as a result of strong demand for hotel rooms worldwide yearoveryear revpar increases were driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent by occupancy improvement the increase in revenue versus the prior year also reflects recognition in 2005 of 14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results but not earned and due until 2005 higher timeshare sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue also improved our 2005 revenues in addition revenues increased due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004 as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter further owned and leased revenue increased significantly primarily as a result of the purchase of 13 formerly managed ctf properties 

the 14 percent increase in total revenue includes 743 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue to 7671 million in 2005 from 6928 million in the prior year the increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and wage increases we added 45 managed properties 4519 rooms net to our system in 2005 including the whitbread properties more fully discussed later in this report under the caption “marriott and whitbread joint venture” in the “liquidity and capital resources” section and we also added 49 franchised properties 6333 rooms net to our system in 2005 

operating income 

2006 compared to 2005 

operating income increased 456 million to 1011 million in 2006 from 555 million in the prior year the increase in 2006 is in part due to a combined base franchise and incentive fee increase of 197 million reflecting stronger revpar growth unit growth and propertylevel margin improvements stronger owned leased corporate 

  

housing and other revenue net of direct expenses contributed 17 million of the improvement in operating income and reflected the strong demand environment in 2006 and the impact of the ctf properties acquired in 2005 the 17 million improvement in 2006 versus the prior year reflects increased owned and leased results of 20 million a 12 million increase in termination fees received and 5 million of higher other income partially offset by 20 million of lower land lease income also reflected in the yearoveryear change in owned and leased results are depreciation charges totaling 7 million recorded in 2006 associated with two properties that were reclassified in 2006 from “held for sale” to “held and used” the depreciation charges totaling 7 million represented the amount that would have been recognized had the two properties been continuously classified as “held and used” 

timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses increased 98 million in 2006 and largely reflects 77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains as noted earlier in the “revenue” discussion note securitization gains of 69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue but instead are a component of gains and other income also reflected in the 98 million favorable variance development revenue net of expenses increased 14 million and financing services and other revenue net of expenses increased 7 million increased development revenue net of expenses primarily reflects lower development expenses associated with projects in 2006 in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with statement of position 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” “sop 042” implemented in 2006 increased financing services and other revenue net of expenses reflects a 15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves in 2006 

as compared to the year ago period general administrative and other expenses decreased by 76 million in 2005 we incurred general administrative and other expenses of 94 million primarily due to the noncash writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements resulting from the ctf transaction we also incurred general administrative and other expenses of 30 million in 2005 associated with our bedding incentive program we implemented the bedding incentive program in the 2005 second quarter to help ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by yearend 2005 further impacting general administrative and other expenses 2005 reflected performance cure payments of 15 million versus a 6 million similar payment in 2006 and 2005 also reflected 9 million of guarantee charges associated with three properties versus the reversal of an additional 5 million of guarantee charges in 2006 additionally impacting the yearoveryear general administrative and other expenses variance were foreign exchange gains totaling 6 million in 2006 as compared to losses of 5 million in 2005 

also impacting the yearoveryear change in general administrative and other expenses development expenses and deferred compensation expenses were higher in 2006 by 15 million and 5 million respectively as noted under the heading “new accounting standards” later in this report we adopted a new accounting standard in 2006 associated with sharebased compensation this new standard resulted in incremental general administrative and other expenses of 39 million versus 2005 primarily impacting the unallocated portion of our general administrative and other expenses of the 76 million decrease in total general administrative and other expenses a decrease of 124 million was attributable to our lodging segments and a 48 million increase was unallocated 

finally operating income for 2006 included a synthetic fuel operating loss of 76 million versus an operating loss of 144 million in the prior year primarily reflecting production suspensions in 2006 due to high oil prices for additional information see our “synthetic fuel” segment discussion later in this report 

2005 compared to 2004 

operating income increased 78 million to 555 million in 2005 from 477 million in the prior year primarily as a result of the following items a combined base incentive and franchise fee improvement of 154 million reflecting a stronger demand environment 51 million of stronger timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue and 65 million of stronger owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses the fee improvement versus the prior year also reflects the recognition in 2005 of 14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results but not earned and due until 2005 the increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005 including the ctf properties and to a lesser extent the strong demand environment in 2005 and our receipt in 2005 of a 10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system 

the favorable items noted above were also partially offset by 146 million of increased general and administrative expenses and 46 million of lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses increased general administrative and other expenses were associated with our lodging segments as unallocated general administrative and other expenses were down slightly compared to the prior year the increase in general administrative and other expenses reflects a 94 million charge impacting our north american fullservice and international lodging segments primarily due to the noncash writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements associated with our acquisition of the ctf properties and 30 million of 

  

expenses associated with our bedding incentive program impacting our north american fullservice north american limitedservice and international lodging segments general administrative and other expenses in 2005 also reflect pretax performance termination cure payments of 15 million associated with two properties a 9 million pretax charge associated with three guarantees increased other net overhead costs of 13 million including costs related to the company’s unit growth development and systems and 2 million of increased foreign exchange losses partially offset by 5 million of lower litigation expenses additionally in 2004 general administrative and other expenses included a 13 million charge associated with the writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs 

operating income for 2005 included a synthetic fuel operating loss of 144 million versus a 98 million operating loss in the prior year reflecting increased costs and the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue and expenses for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004 as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter for additional information see our “synthetic fuel” segment discussion later in this report 

gains and other income 

the following table shows our gains and other income for 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 gains on saleincome on redemption of joint venture investments of 68 million in 2006 represents 43 million of net gains associated with the sale of joint venture investments and 25 million of income associated with the redemption of preferred stock we held in one investee as further explained in the earlier “revenues” discussion for 2006 timeshare segment note sale gains of 77 million in 2006 are presented in the “timeshare sales and services” revenue caption 

interest expense 

2006 compared to 2005 

interest expense increased 18 million 17 percent to 124 million in 2006 from 106 million in 2005 included within interest expense for 2006 are charges totaling 46 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf including the marriott rewards gift certificates and selfinsurance programs the increase in interest on these programs over 2005 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates interest expense also increased in 2006 due to our june 2005 series f notes issuance our june 2006 series h notes issuance and higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff at maturity of both our series d notes in april 2005 and series b notes in november 2005 and the exchange of our series c and series e notes for lower interest rate series g notes in 2005 

2005 compared to 2004 

interest expense increased 7 million 7 percent to 106 million in 2005 from 99 million in the prior year reflecting increased debt levels which helped to facilitate significantly higher capital expenditures and share repurchases in 2005 interest expense in 2005 reflected our june 2005 series f notes issuance and versus the prior year higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates included within interest expense for 2005 are charges totaling 29 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf including the marriott rewards gift certificates and selfinsurance programs the increase over 2004 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff at maturity of both our series d notes in april 2005 and series b notes in november 2005 and the capitalization of more interest associated with the development of timeshare properties 

  

interest income provision for loan losses and income tax 

2006 compared to 2005 

interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased 34 million 43 percent to 45 million in 2006 from 79 million in 2005 primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us in 2005 also reflected in the decrease versus the prior year are 4 million of marktomarket expenses in 2006 associated with hedges for our synthetic fuel operations loan loss provisions decreased 31 million versus the prior year reflecting the reversal of loan loss provisions totaling 3 million in 2006 compared to a charge of 17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our delta air lines inc aircraft leveraged lease see the “investment in leveraged lease” caption later in this report for additional information and an 11 million loan loss provision in 2005 associated with one property 

our tax provision totaled 286 million in 2006 compared to a tax provision of 94 million in 2005 the difference of 192 million is primarily attributable to 96 million of higher taxes in 2006 associated with higher pretax income from our lodging operations and 96 million of lower tax credits and tax benefit in 2006 associated with our synthetic fuel operations that generated a net tax benefit of 94 million in 2006 compared to a net tax benefit of 190 million in 2005 as discussed in more detail in the “synthetic fuel” segment caption later in this report 2006 includes a provision for an estimated 39 percent phaseout of tax credits associated with the synthetic fuel operations due to high oil prices 

2005 compared to 2004 

interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased 67 million 46 percent to 79 million in 2005 from 146 million in the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us our provision for loan losses increased 36 million versus the prior year reflecting an 11 million charge in 2005 associated with one property and a charge of 17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our delta air lines inc aircraft leveraged lease and the reversal in 2004 of loan loss provisions totaling 8 million 

our tax provision totaled 94 million in 2005 compared to a tax provision of 100 million in 2004 the difference of 6 million is primarily attributable to 19 million of higher taxes in 2005 associated with higher pretax income from our lodging operations more than offset by 25 million of higher tax credits and tax benefit in 2005 associated with our synthetic fuel operations that generated a net tax benefit of 190 million in 2005 compared to a net tax benefit of 165 million in 2004 and to a lesser extent to a lower tax rate before the impact of the synthetic fuel segment in 2005 as a result of a higher proportion of income in countries with lower effective tax rates for additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the synthetic fuel segment later in this report 

equity in earnings losses 

2006 compared to 2005 

the 33 million decline from earnings of 36 million in 2005 to earnings of 3 million in 2006 attributable to our equity investments reflected the recognition in 2005 of 30 million of equity earnings from the sale of hotels by three equity joint ventures in which we had equity interests in addition since 2005 we have sold several equity joint ventures 

2005 compared to 2004 

equity in earnings losses of equity method investees increased 78 million from a net loss of 42 million in 2004 to net earnings of 36 million in 2005 twentyeight million dollars of the increase is attributable to our synthetic fuel joint ventures that we reported as an equity investment in the 2004 first quarter versus consolidation of the joint ventures for the periods thereafter for additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the synthetic fuel segment later in this report the remaining 50 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to several joint ventures with significant asset sales in 2005 favorably impacting the profitability of the joint ventures producing higher earnings from joint ventures and to a lesser extent the stronger 2005 lodging demand environment and the mix of investments in each year 

minority interest 

2006 compared to 2005 

minority interest decreased 39 million in 2006 from a benefit of 45 million in 2005 to a benefit of 6 million on the first day of our 2006 fiscal year we redeemed our partner’s interest in synthetic american fuel enterprises ii llc “safe ii” which owns three of our four synthetic fuel production facilities also effective october 1 2006 we purchased our partner’s interest in synthetic american fuel enterprises i llc “safe i” accordingly in 2006 minority interest represents only our partner’s share of the losses in safe i through 

  

september 30 2006 for 2005 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for all four production facilities in addition synthetic fuel operating losses in 2006 were significantly lower versus 2005 reflecting reduced production for additional information see footnote no 2 “synthetic fuel” later in this report 

2005 compared to 2004 

minority interest increased from a benefit of 40 million in 2004 to a benefit of 45 million in 2005 primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations for 2004 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from march 26 2004 when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of fin 46r through yearend for 2005 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year 

income from continuing operations 

2006 compared to 2005 

compared to 2005 income from continuing operations increased 49 million 7 percent to 717 million in 2006 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 021 14 percent to 166 as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with “operating income” the increase versus the prior year is due to higher fee income 197 million lower general administrative and other expenses 76 million lower synthetic fuel operating losses 68 million higher owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 17 million a lower loan loss provision 31 million and higher timeshare interval sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 98 million partially offsetting these favorable variances were significantly higher taxes 192 million lower gains and other income 122 million lower interest income 34 million higher interest expense 18 million a lower minority interest benefit 39 million and lower equity investment results 33 million 

2005 compared to 2004 

income from continuing operations increased 74 million 12 percent to 668 million in 2005 versus the prior year and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 021 17 percent to 145 as discussed above in more detail the increase in income from continuing operations from the prior year is primarily due to the strong demand environment for lodging increased owned leased and corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses 65 million principally reflecting owned and leased properties acquired in the 2005 third quarter increased timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses 51 million stronger equity investment results 78 million higher gains and other income 17 million and lower taxes 6 million as discussed earlier in the report in more detail increased general administrative and other expenses 146 million reflected among other things the writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs in connection with the ctf transaction and expenses associated with our bedding incentive program higher synthetic fuel operating losses 46 million lower interest income 67 million higher interest expense 7 million and a higher loan loss provision 36 million partially offset these favorable items 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

statement of position 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued financial accounting standards “fas” no 152 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactionsan amendment of fasb statements no 66 and 67” and the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop 042 additionally the fasb amended fas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” and fas no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” to exclude accounting for real estate timesharing transactions from these statements we adopted sop 042 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter 

under sop 042 we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred we also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale we also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs 

the initial adoption of sop 042 in our 2006 first quarter which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of income resulted in a noncash aftertax charge of 105 million 024 per diluted share as a result of tax rate adjustments in the 2006 fourth quarter we reduced the tax benefit associated with the initial adoption from 68 million to 64 million accordingly the aftertax impact of 

  

the adoption was 109 million 025 per diluted share as a result of the change “net income” of 65 million 015 per diluted share as reported in the 2006 first quarter now totals 61 million 014 per diluted share the pretax charge totaled 173 million and comprised a 130 million inventory writedown the establishment of a 25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of 18 million we estimate that the ongoing impact of adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial 

the american resort development association a timeshare trade association of which we are a member and the staff of the united states securities and exchange commission had communications regarding sop 042 and the income statement presentation of timeshare note securitizations gains as a result of those communications we reclassified in our 2006 third quarter in our consolidated statement of income timeshare segment note securitization gains of 40 million recognized in the 2006 second quarter from the “gains and other income” caption to the “timeshare sales and services” revenue caption as a result of the change “timeshare sales and services” revenue of 331 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter now totals 371 million and “gains and other income” of 48 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter now totals 8 million including 37 million of timeshare segment note securitization gains recognized in the 2006 fourth quarter fullyear 2006 note securitization gains totaling 77 million are reflected within our “timeshare sales and services” revenue caption 

we estimate that for the 20year period from 2007 through 2026 the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately 19 billion 

business segments 

we are a diversified hospitality company with operations in six business segments 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2006 the company analyzed its internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency as part of this process we evaluated the impact on segment reporting and made certain changes that were in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these reporting changes are in conformity with the requirements of fas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” “fas no 131” and will better enable investors to view the company the way management views it accordingly we now report six operating segments as compared to five before the change and indirect administrative expenses are no longer allocated to our segments senior management allocates resources and assesses performance based on the six operating segments the revised segment reporting is reflected throughout this report for all periods presented historical figures are presented in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses interest expense or indirect general administrative and other expenses with the exception of the synthetic fuel segment we do not allocate income taxes or interest income to our segments as note sales are an integral part of the timeshare segment we include note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains and losses as well as equity earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general administrative and other expenses to each of our segments “other unallocated corporate” represents that portion of our revenues general administrative and other expenses equity in earnings or losses and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments 

  

we have aggregated the brands presented within our north american fullservice north american limitedservice international and luxury segments considering their similar economic characteristics types of customers distribution channels the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational structure and management reporting structure 

at yearend 2006 we operated or franchised the following properties by segment excluding 2046 corporate housing rental units

lodging development 

we opened 136 properties totaling 23466 rooms across our brands in 2006 and 45 properties 8616 rooms left the system highlights of the year included 

 

  

  

  

 we currently have approximately 100000 rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development in our pipeline and we expect to add approximately 30000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2007 we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements nonetheless our ability to sell properties that we develop and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriottbranded properties both of which are important parts of our growth plan depend in part on capital access availability and cost for other hotel developers and thirdparty owners these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report

 2006 compared to 2005 

in 2006 across our north american fullservice lodging segment we added 15 properties 4971 rooms and six properties 1604 rooms left the system 

in 2006 revpar for comparable companyoperated north american fullservice properties increased 85 percent to 12110 occupancy for these properties decreased 04 percentage points while average daily rates increased 90 percent to 16727 

compared to the prior year our 2006 results reflect a 59 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees the increase in fees is largely due to stronger revpar driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent to higher food and beverage meeting room rental and other revenue and productivity improvements all of which favorably impacted propertylevel house profit margins the growth in the number of rooms yearoveryear also contributed to the increase in fees incentive fees included 10 million for 2005 that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until they were recognized similarly base management fees for 2006 included 4 million of fees that were calculated based on prior period results but not earned and due until 2006 owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses decreased 8 million primarily as a result of properties sold in 2006 and the receipt in 2005 of a 10 million termination fee associated with one property partially offset by the receipt in 2006 of 10 million in termination fees 

general administrative and other expenses decreased 69 million as a result of among other things a 60 million charge in 2005 associated with the ctf transaction more fully discussed in the previous “operating income” discussion as well as expenses of 14 million in 2005 related to our bedding incentive program partially offset by increased expenses in 2006 reflecting costs related to unit growth and development systems improvements and increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits in 2005 general administrative and other expenses included 3 million of performance cure payments associated with one property in 2006 general administrative and other expenses included a 5 million performance cure payment 

gains and other income was 3 million higher than the prior year and reflected the redemption of preferred stock in a cost method investee that generated income of 25 million in 2006 and 15 million of higher net gains and other income in 2006 reflecting gains in 2006 associated with the sale of joint venture investments and real estate that were partially offset by lower gains in 2006 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties gains and other income for 2006 reflected a 37 million noncash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value associated with land we own and lease as further described in the “expected land sale” caption later in this report equity results decreased by 19 million versus the prior year and reflected the recognition in 2005 of 16 million in equity earnings from two joint ventures as a result of the ventures’ sale of hotels and our sale of some joint venture investments in 2005 and 2006 offset to some extent by improved equity joint venture results reflecting the stronger demand environment 

2005 compared to 2004 

in 2005 across our north american fullservice lodging segment we added 20 properties 6141 rooms and five properties 1995 rooms left the system 

in 2005 revpar for comparable companyoperated north american fullservice properties increased 96 percent to 11241 occupancy for these properties increased 14 percentage points while average daily rates increased 75 percent to 15400 

compared to the prior year our 2005 segment results reflect a 58 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees and 35 million of increased owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses the increase in fees is largely due to stronger revpar driven primarily by rate increases that favorably impact propertylevel house profits the growth in the number of rooms and the recognition in 2005 of 10 million of 

  

incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until 2005 the increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005 many of which were sold throughout 2006 as expected including the ctf properties in addition owned leased and other revenue in 2005 reflected our receipt of a 10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system 

somewhat offsetting the net favorable variances were 78 million of higher general administrative and other expenses as noted in the preceding “operating income” discussion during 2005 we recorded a 60 million pretax charge primarily due to the noncash writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of ctf management agreements and we incurred expenses of 14 million related to our bedding incentive program both of which impacted our general administrative and other expenses in 2005 we also recorded performance termination cure payments of 3 million associated with one property which impacted general administrative and other expenses in addition in 2005 there were increased overhead costs associated with unit growth and development 

further impacting segment results gains and other income was 15 million lower than the prior year while equity results increased by 13 million versus the prior year the decrease in gains and other income is primarily attributable to the 13 million gain in 2004 associated with the sale of our interest in the two flags joint venture the increase in equity results is primarily attributable to several joint ventures that had significant asset sales in 2005 generating gains and to a lesser extent the favorable variance is also a result of a stronger demand environment and the mix of investments

the 77 million increase in segment results for 2006 primarily reflects a 77 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees 27 million of lower general administrative and other expenses and 6 million of increased equity results partially offset by 14 million of lower owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses and 19 million of lower gains and other income the increase in fees is largely due to higher revpar driven by rate increases which impacted propertylevel house profits and to a lesser extent to 2006 productivity improvements and the growth in the number of rooms stronger performance at our renovated courtyard properties versus nonrenovated properties is also contributing to the increase in segment results over the prior year the decrease in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses reflects lower lease revenue as a result of our sale late in 2005 of a portfolio of land underlying 75 courtyard hotels partially offset by improved owned and leased results in 2006 reflecting stronger demand the decrease in general administrative and other expenses of 27 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling 11 million associated with our bedding incentive program a 6 million litigation charge and a 3 million guarantee charge improved equity results in 2006 versus 2005 reflect the impact of a stronger demand environment in 2006 new joint ventures and the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the courtyard joint venture through the first quarter of 2005 versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter gains and other income decreased 19 million in 2006 as a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land that generated gains and other income of 17 million a 10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity to us of the loan we made to the courtyard joint venture partially offset by higher other real estate and other gains of 4 million in 2006 and increased income of 4 million in 2006 associated with cost method joint ventures

in 2005 revpar for comparable companyoperated north american limitedservice properties increased 94 percent to 7649 occupancy for these properties increased 05 percentage points to 738 percent while average daily rates increased 87 percent to 10370 

the increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger revpar driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms the 70 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a 57 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees 8 million of lower owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses 3 million of higher gains and other income an 11 million increase in equity results and 7 million of lower general administrative and other expenses general administrative and other expenses in 2005 included 11 million of expenses associated with our bedding incentive program in 2004 we wrote off deferred contract acquisition costs impacting general administrative and other expenses totaling 13 million the 2005 increase in gains and other income is primarily a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 courtyard hotels which generated gains and other income of 17 million a 10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity to us of the loan we made to the courtyard joint venture and increased income of 4 million in 2005 associated with cost method joint ventures partially offset by 27 million of gains in 2004 primarily associated with land sales the decline in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to our execustay brand’s shift to franchising improved equity results primarily reflect the impact of owning a 50 percent interest in the courtyard joint venture through the 2005 first quarter versus owning a 21 percent interest thereafter stronger performance at our reinvented courtyard properties versus nonreinvented properties is also contributing to the increase in revenue and segment results from the prior year for additional information related to the courtyard joint venture see the “courtyard joint venture” caption in “liquidity and capital resources” later in this report

expenses reflects 19 million of improved results for owned and leased properties primarily due to the stronger demand environment and an increase of 12 million for termination fees for several properties the 19 million improvement in owned and lease results also reflects the impact of a 5 million charge in 2006 for depreciation expense associated with one property that was reclassified from “held for sale” to “held and used” as it was not sold within one year of its classification as “held for sale” as expected 

the 15 million increase in gains and other income is primarily attributable to gains on the sale of various joint ventures throughout 2006 partially offset by lower other income associated with one of the sold cost method joint venture investments the decrease in general administrative and other expenses of 37 million is attributable to the recognition of expenses in 2005 totaling 5 million associated with our bedding incentive program as well as a 34 million charge in 2005 associated with the ctf transaction discussed more fully in the previous operating income disclosure also impacting general administrative and other expenses in 2005 we recorded expenses totaling 6 million associated with two guarantees and 2006 reflected 7 million of increased expenses related to unit growth and development systems improvements and increased ordinary costs such as wages and benefits

reflected in the 98 million variance development revenue net of expenses increased 14 million primarily reflecting lower development expenses in 2006 associated with projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and the timing of expenses associated with sop 042 implemented in 2006 additionally the 98 million variance reflected a 15 million reversal of marketing related contingency reserves and 12 million of higher financing revenue net of expense partially offset by 21 million of lower services revenue net of expenses the 3 million decline in equity income primarily reflects startup loses associated with several new joint ventures partially offset by improved performance at other joint ventures the 72 million decline in gains and other income primarily reflected 69 million of note securitization gains in 2005 versus the recording of note securitization gains in revenue for 2006 while the 16 million increase in general administrative and other expenses reflected higher program and joint venture development expenses and customary increases in ordinary costs such as wages and benefits

synthetic fuel 

see footnote no 2 “synthetic fuel” and footnote no 18 “contingencies” in this report for additional information regarding the synthetic fuel segment 

the tables that follow detail the impact of our synthetic fuel segment on our income from continuing operations for 2006 2005 and 2004 our management evaluates the figures presented in the “before syn fuel impact” columns because management expects the synthetic fuel segment will no longer have a material impact on our business after the internal revenue code synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of 2007 and because the presentation reflects the results of our core lodging operations management also believes that these presentations facilitate the comparison of our results with the results of other lodging companies however the figures presented in the “before syn fuel impact” columns are nongaap financial measures may be calculated andor presented differently than presentations of other companies and are not alternatives to operating income total tax provision benefit income from continuing operations or any other operating measure prescribed by us generally accepted accounting principles 

2006 compared to 2005 

for 2006 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 165 million versus revenue of 421 million for the prior year primarily reflecting significantly lower production in 2006 as a result of production suspensions instituted in response to high oil prices the 76 million operating loss for 2006 includes a 5 million charge reflecting the writedown of assets at the alabama production facility as the adjacent mine was closed at yearend and we did not anticipate operating the facility again at this location gains and other income expense reflects either net earnout payments received or net earnout payments made in 2006 net earnout payments made totaled 15 million while in 2005 net earnout payments received totaled 32 million lower minority interest income primarily reflects the redemption early in 2006 of our partner’s interest in safe ii additionally lower minority interest income in 2006 also reflects our buyout in the 2006 fourth quarter of our partner’s interest in safe i interest costs in 2006 of 4 million reflect the cost of hedges entered into during 2006 in response to high oil prices and the uncertainty surrounding the potential phaseout of tax credits income from continuing operations for the synthetic fuel segment declined from 125 million in 2005 to 5 million in 2006 primarily as a result of both lower production in 2006 and the estimated 39 percent phaseout of tax credits due to high oil prices in 2006 

  

the table below details the impact of our synthetic fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2006 and 2005 

 

 2005 compared to 2004 

for 2005 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 421 million versus revenue of 321 million for the prior year primarily due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue for the entire 2005 year compared with only three quarters in 2004 as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter 

the 18 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to 125 million from 107 million in 2004 is primarily due to our increased proportion of tax credits through may 31 2005 associated with the safe ii facilities that were then under irs review and higher gains and other income partially offset by our decreased proportion of tax credits through march 31 2005 associated with the safe i facility that was not under irs review in addition in 2005 production was slightly lower and raw materials prices were higher than in 2004 gains and other income represents net earnout payments received minority interest increased from a benefit of 40 million in 2004 to a benefit of 47 million in 2005 primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations for 2004 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from march 26 2004 when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of fin 46r through yearend for 2005 minority interest represents our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year 

  

the table below details the impact of our synthetic fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2005 and 2004 

 

 new accounting standards 

fas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” 

under our 2002 comprehensive stock and cash incentive plan “the comprehensive plan” we currently award to participating employees 1 stock options to purchase our class a common stock “stock option program” 2 stock appreciation rights for our class a common stock and 3 restricted stock units of our class a common stock 

as noted in footnote no 1 “basis of presentation” under the heading “new accounting pronouncements” we adopted fas no 123r “accounting for stockbased compensation” “fas no 123r” using the modified prospective transition method at the beginning of our 2006 first quarter in accordance with the modified prospective transition method we did not restate our consolidated financial statements for prior periods to reflect the impact of fas no 123r for all sharebased awards granted after the date we adopted fas no 123r and for the unvested portion of previously granted sharebased awards that were outstanding on that date fas no 123r requires that we measure compensation costs related to our sharebased payment transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award previously under fas no 123 and apb opinion no 25 we accounted for our sharebased employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb opinion no 25” and recognized sharebased compensation expense for all awards except for our stock option program awards sharebased compensation expense totaled 62 million and 47 million for 2004 and 2005 respectively 

under fas no 123r we recorded sharebased compensation expense of 108 million in 2006 deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled 168 million at yearend 2006 and the weighted average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is two years deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled 137 million at yearend 2005 

fas no 123r requires that sharebased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service the “substantive vesting period” in periods prior to the adoption of fas no 123r we showed sharebased compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure only for option awards to retirementeligible employees over the 

  

awards’ stated vesting period in periods prior to the adoption of fas no 123r we recorded sharebased compensation expense for our other awards to retirementeligible employees over the awards’ stated vesting period with the adoption of fas no 123r we continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion of awards granted prior to adoption of fas no 123r and follow the substantive vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of fas no 123r 

in connection with the adoption of fas no 123r we reviewed among other things our forfeiture and volatility assumptions estimated volatilities for 2006 were based on the historical shareprice volatility for a period equal to the stock option’s or share appreciation right’s expected lives ending on the day of grant and calculated based on weekly data the weighted average expected stock option or share appreciation right terms for 2006 were a product of the latticebased binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the expected terms in august 2005 the board of directors amended the comprehensive plan to provide participants the ability during a limited time frame in 2005 to elect to accelerate the schedule for distribution of certain vested deferred shares the amendment did not alter the previously established vesting schedule in 2005 we also changed from using the blackscholes option pricing method to estimate the fair value of each stock option or share appreciation right on the grant date to using the binomial valuation method to improve the estimate of fair value 

in 2005 we changed the method in which we issue sharebased awards to our key employees in prior years sharebased compensation for key employees consisted primarily of stock options upon consideration of several factors we began in 2005 to award key employees a combination of stock options and restricted stock units therefore this change resulted in an increase in restricted stock expense 

the adoption of fas no 123r in 2006 resulted in the recognition of incremental sharebased compensation costs in 2006 of 39 million a reduction in net income of 25 million net of tax benefits of 14 million and a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of 006 in accordance with fas no 123r we present the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of sharebased awards as financing cash flows prior to the adoption of fas no 123r we reported the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of sharebased awards as operating cash flows the adoption of fas no 123r resulted in a decrease in 2006 of 193 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of 193 million in cash flows from financing activities related to excess tax benefits from sharebased awards the aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under sharebased payment arrangements was 184 million 125 million and 206 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

under the provisions of fas no 123r the “deferred compensation” line on our consolidated balance sheet a contraequity line representing the amount of unrecognized sharebased compensation costs is no longer presented accordingly the amount that had been on the “deferred compensation” line at yearend 2005 was reversed in the 2006 first quarter through the “additional paidincapital” line on our consolidated balance sheet

future adoption of accounting standards 

fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 is an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return additionally fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 which is our 2007 fiscal year and its provisions are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption upon adoption of fin 48 only tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized the cumulative effect of applying fin 48 if any is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption we are evaluating the impact that fin 48 will have on our financial statements 

fas no 156 “accounting for servicing of financial assets” 

in march 2006 the fasb issued fas no 156 “accounting for servicing of financial assets” “fas no 156” fas no 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities are to be initially measured at fair value it also allows entities to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities 

  

this standard is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after september 15 2006 which is our 2007 fiscal year we have determined that fas no 156 will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

fas no 157 “fair value measurements” 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fas no 157 “fair value measurements” “fas no 157” this standard defines fair value establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements fas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which is our 2008 fiscal year provisions of fas no 157 are required to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which fas no 157 is applied we are evaluating the impact that fas no 157 will have on our financial statements 

eitf issue no 068 “applicability of the assessment of a buyer’s continuing investment under fasb statement no 66 for sales of condominiums” 

in november 2006 the emerging issues task force of the fasb “eitf” reached a consensus on eitf issue no 068 “applicability of the assessment of a buyer’s continuing investment under fasb statement no 66 accounting for sales of real estate for sales of condominiums” “eitf 068” eitf 068 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing investment criterion in fas no 66 in order for profit to be recognized under the percentageofcompletion method eitf 068 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after march 15 2007 which is our 2008 fiscal year the cumulative effect of applying eitf 068 if any is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption we are evaluating the impact that eitf 068 will have on our financial statements 

investment in leveraged lease 

at yearend 2006 we had a 23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with delta air lines inc “delta” which we acquired in 1994 the gross investment is comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income on september 14 2005 delta filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease as a result we believe our investment was impaired and have recorded pretax charges of approximately 18 million through 2006 

expected land sale 

in 1988 the company as landlord entered into a 59year ground lease with a lessee for land that was improved with a hotel that is owned by the lessee the hotel was previously branded a marriott property however currently it is not the lease contains contractual rental increases over the term of the lease and annual ground rent on the land currently totals approximately 5 million the lease also contains a provision that permits the lessee under certain circumstances to purchase the land for a fixed price the company and the lessee have had various discussions concerning the land as well as the hotel during the 2006 second quarter it became probable that none of the proposed transactions were acceptable to both parties and the lessee indicated its intent to exercise its option to purchase the land accordingly in the 2006 second quarter we reclassified the land from the “property and equipment” caption in our consolidated balance sheet to the “assets held for sale” caption and recorded a 37 million noncash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value additional amounts may be due us depending on the lessee’s use of the land subsequent to purchase however such amounts will only be recorded if and when paid 

effective tax rate 

tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years because that program ends with 2007 synthetic fuel production our synthetic fuel production facilities will not be able to generate credits in future years as a result our future effective tax rate is likely to increase significantly thereby reducing our aftertax profits 

discontinued operations 

distribution services 

in 2005 and 2004 we had income net of tax of 1 million and 2 million respectively associated with the distribution services business that we exited in 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

we are party to a 20 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program and letters of credit effective june 6 2006 we executed an amendment extending the maturity date for 1955 billion of commitments under this agreement by one year to june 6 2011 the remaining 45 million commitment still matures on june 6 2010 borrowings under this facility bear interest at the london interbank offered rate plus a spread based on our public debt rating additionally we pay annual fees on the facility at a rate also based on our public debt rating we do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility we classify commercial paper as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

at yearend 2006 our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1770 billion and reflected borrowing capacity at 20 billion under the credit facility plus our cash balance of 193 million less the letters of credit outstanding under the facility of 108 million and 315 million of outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility we consider these resources together with cash we expect to generate from operations adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements we periodically evaluate opportunities to sell additional debt or equity securities obtain credit facilities from lenders or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

we issue shortterm commercial paper in europe and in the united states our commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper in each of these markets as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature 

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper 

cash from operations 

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

 

 we have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2006 presentation the reclassifications were primarily associated with timeshare segment inventory that is now a component of “current assets” in our consolidated balance sheet and was previously a component of “property and equipment” 

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly 08 to one at yearend 2006 and 06 to one at yearend 2005 we minimize working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover we also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital 

  

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to this report are as follows 

 

 while our timeshare segment generates strong operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we include timeshare reportable sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash the following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare segment which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our timeshare segment 

 

 our ability to sell timeshare segment notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate although we do not expect such deterioration loans to timeshare segment owners including a current portion of 70 million totaled 386 million at yearend 2006 loans to timeshare segment owners including a current portion of 33 million totaled 344 million at yearend 2005

capital expenditures and other investments capital expenditures of 529 million in 2006 780 million in 2005 and 181 million in 2004 included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives timeshare segment development expenditures which are included in “cash from operations” as noted in that section’s narrative are not reflected in these numbers over time we have sold lodging properties under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales if we were unable to do so our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact on our business operations of changes in capital market conditions we also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans and minority equity investments 

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging segments because 1 we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale 

dispositions property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 798 million in 2006 298 million in 2005 and 402 million in 2004 in 2006 we closed on the sales of 11 hotels and seven joint venture investments cash proceeds of 26 million for one of the hotels sold in 2006 are not reflected in the 798 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency and impacted the other investing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows rather than dispositions the contingency was subsequently resolved and sale accounting was achieved in 2006 

the sold properties included eight properties purchased in 2005 from ctf holdings ltd and certain of its affiliates collectively “ctf” for additional information regarding the ctf transaction see footnote no 8 “acquisitions and dispositions” later in this report 

loan activity we have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel based on historical experience over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit loan collections and sales net of advances during 2006 amounted to 62 million lodging senior loans outstanding totaled 9 million which included a current portion of 1 million at yearend 2006 and 59 million which included a current portion of 2 million at yearend 2005 lodging mezzanine and other loans totaled 268 million which included a current portion of 32 million at yearend 2006 and 274 million which included a current portion of 13 million at yearend 2005 in 2006 our notes receivable balance associated with lodging senior loans and lodging mezzanine and other loans declined by 56 million and primarily reflects the repayment of several loans 

equity and cost method investments cash outflows of 95 million in 2006 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in three joint ventures cash outflows of 216 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in 2005 of a 5050 joint venture with whitbread

  the following table summarizes our commitments as of yearend 2006 

 

 our guarantees where we are the primary obligor listed above include 43 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows andor proceeds from the sale of hotels

the guarantees where we are secondarily liable above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the renaissance hotel group nv in 1997 consisting of annual rent payments of approximately 22 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately 218 million we are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations since we assumed these guarantees we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future ctf has made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees as ctf obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system our contingent liability exposure of approximately 218 million will decline 

in addition to the guarantees described above in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party from time to time we provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the joint venture 

  

owner or our own actions we have also provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of 524 million payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture which is 34 percent we do not expect to fund under this guarantee 

in addition to the guarantees noted previously as of yearend 2006 we had extended approximately 11 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties under which we expect to fund 5 million by yearend 2007 we do not expect to fund the remaining 6 million of commitments which expire as follows 1 million within one year 1 million in three to four years and 4 million after five years at yearend 2006 we also have commitments to invest 31 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase both north american fullservice and limitedservice hotels which expire as follows 5 million within one year 21 million in one to two years and 5 million after five years 

at yearend 2006 we also had 108 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf the majority of which related to our selfinsurance programs surety bonds issued on our behalf as of yearend 2006 totaled 640 million the majority of which were requested by federal state or local governments in relation to our timeshare and lodging operations and selfinsurance programs 

as part of the normal course of the hotel management business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of hotels we manage for owners since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow 

audit of employee stock ownership plan transaction 

the internal revenue service “irs” is currently auditing the company’s federal tax returns for the 2000 2001 and 2002 fiscal years as part of that audit the irs is reviewing a leveraged employee stock ownership plan “esop” feature of the company’s employees’ profit sharing retirement and savings plan and trust the “plan” that was implemented in a transaction the “esop transaction” on june 13 2000 principal and interest on the debt related to the transaction was forgiven over a 26month period as a mechanism for funding company contributions of elective deferrals and matching contributions to the plan the company claimed federal income tax deductions for the forgiven principal on the debt in the amount of 1 billion over that period along with forgiven interest on the debt the benefit related to the tax deductions was reflected in equity and did not flow through the provision for income taxes 

based on discussions with the irs during the course of the audit the irs may seek to disallow some or all of the deductions related to the esop transaction and may seek to impose other taxes penalties and interest including excise taxes for prohibited transactions under section 4975 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in a january 19 2007 letter to the company the us department of labor confirmed that it is reviewing the esop transaction the company has retained counsel to assist with the audit process and to respond to any claims or assessments the irs or department of labor issues although we are early in the process of closing this audit we do not expect the result of the audit to have a material impact on either equity for any lost deductions or earnings for interest or penalties if any related to the esop transaction

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them 

marriott rewards 

marriott rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program marriott rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations purchases of timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership products and to a lesser degree through participation in affiliated partners’ programs such as those offered by car rental and credit card companies points which we track on members’ behalf can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations airline tickets airline frequent flyer program miles rental cars and a variety of other awards however points cannot be redeemed for cash we provide marriott rewards as a marketing program to participating properties we charge the cost of operating the program including the estimated cost of award redemption to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures 

we defer revenue received from managed franchised and marriottownedleased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation we determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed these judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points 

our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program including marketing promotion communication with and performing member services for the marriott rewards members due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the marriott rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed we recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded upon the redemption of points we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset we evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur we record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value 

loan loss reserves 

lodging senior loans and lodging mezzanine and other loans 

we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows that assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur or the estimated fair value of the collateral we apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy where we determine that a loan is impaired we recognize interest income on a cash basis at yearend 2006 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 92 million we had a 70 million allowance for credit losses leaving 22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses at yearend 2005 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 184 million we had a 103 million allowance for credit losses leaving 81 million of our investment in impaired 

  

loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses during 2006 and 2005 our average investment in impaired loans totaled 138 million and 182 million respectively 

loans to timeshare owners 

in conjunction with the adoption of sop 042 we now record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale we assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables because we hold large numbers of homogenous timeshare notes receivable we estimate uncollectibles based on historical uncollectibles for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past six years we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis which tracks uncollectibles for each year’s sales over the life of those notes at yearend 2006 our allowance for credit losses associated with “loans to timeshare owners” totaled 29 million 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances 

income taxes 

we record the current year amounts payable or refundable as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 

changes in existing laws and rates and their related interpretations and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 

other matters 

inflation 

inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses

for lodging facilities that we operate we are responsible for hiring training and supervising the managers and employees required to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies for which we generally are reimbursed by the owners we provide centralized reservation services and national advertising marketing and promotional services as well as various accounting and data processing services

timeshare 

  

we develop operate and market timeshare fractional and whole ownership properties under four brand names many timesharing resorts are located adjacent to marriottoperated hotels and timeshare owners have access to certain hotel facilities during their vacation owners can trade their annual interval for intervals at other marriott timesharing resorts or for intervals at certain timesharing resorts not otherwise sponsored by marriott through a thirdparty exchange company owners can also trade their unused interval for points in the marriott rewards frequent stay program enabling them to stay at over 2600 marriott hotels worldwide our timeshare segment operates under the following four brands 

  

the marriott vacation club international “mvci” brand offers fullservice villas featuring living and dining areas one two and threebedroom options full kitchen and washerdryer customers may purchase a one week interval or more at each resort in over 40 locations worldwide this brand draws united states and international customers who vacation regularly with a focus on family relaxation and recreational activities in the united states mvci is located in las vegas nevada in beach andor golf communities in arizona california the carolinas florida and hawaii and in ski resorts in california colorado and utah internationally mvci has resorts in aruba france spain st thomas us virgin islands and thailand

we expect that our future timeshare growth will increasingly reflect opportunities presented by partnerships joint ventures and other business structures we also anticipate that whole ownership products especially of the luxury ritzcarlton club brand will be the fastest growth opportunity within the timeshare segment in 2005 we initiated timeshare interval sales at marriott vacation club international’s frenchman’s cove in st thomas us virgin islands which is expected to open in late 2006 in addition the following resorts opened for operations in 2005 under the marriott vacation club international brand surf watch in hilton head south carolina and las vegas chateau in las vegas nevada

other activities 

  

marriott golf manages 28 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners 

  

we operate 17 systemwide hotel reservation centers 11 in the united states and canada and six in other countries and territories that handle reservation requests for marriott lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others additionally we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further™ best rate guarantee which gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our web site or any other reservation channel our strong marriott rewards loyalty program and our informationrich and easy to use marriottcom web site all encourage customers to make reservations using the marriott web site we have complete control over our inventory and pricing and utilize online and offline agents on an asneeded basis with over 2700 hotels economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and maximize our fee revenue 

  

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from their management or franchise contracts consistent with thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

  

competition 

  

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising there are approximately 615 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands our management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

  

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2005 approximately twothirds of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is fairly concentrated with the five largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

  

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

  

based on lodging industry data we have an 85 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room “revpar” than direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

  

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness our management lease and franchise agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings we believe that these ongoing refurbishment programs are generally adequate to preserve the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties 

  

while service excellence is marriott’s hallmark we continually look for new ways to delight our guests currently we are focused on elevating the marriott experience beyond that of a traditional hotel stay to a total guest experience that encompasses exceptional style personal luxury and superior service this approach to hospitality “the new look and feel of marriott now” is influenced by the world’s foremost innovations in design technology culinary expertise service and comfort this evolution can be seen across all of our brands in new and stylish hotel designs luxurious bedding exotic destinations worldclass spas and fitness centers and inspired cuisine each brand luxury or moderately priced will be more upscale and attuned to customer needs than ever before 

  

in early 2005 we launched marriott’s at your service ® program which focuses on the total guest experience from point of reservation to checkout as part of the prearrival planning service guests receive a personalized email prior to checkin that includes local transportation weather and restaurant information as well as directions and maps at a growing number of hotels and resorts the service has been expanded as a “virtual concierge” guests are able to reserve spa treatments room service for delivery upon arrival and other amenities specific to each property guests may also request complimentary amenities that each property offers such as extra pillows miniature refrigerators and early checkinlate checkout 

  

later in 2005 we also streamlined the travel planning and booking process with the addition of marriott flexrez to at your service in addition to booking hotel rooms on marriottcom our online customers can now find competitive airfare and car rental rates as well 

  

the vacation ownership industry is one of the fastest growing segments in hospitality and is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies since entering the timeshare industry in 1984 we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide competition in the timeshare fractional ownership and whole ownership business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts trust in the brand the pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits such as exchange programs we believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences combined with our financial strength diverse market presence strong brands and wellmaintained properties will enable us to remain competitive approximately 37 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners 

  

marriott rewards is a frequent guest program with over 23 million members and nine participating marriott brands the marriott rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 27 participating airline programs we believe that marriott rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2005 over 45 percent of our room nights were purchased by marriott rewards members in addition the ability of marriott vacation club international timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into marriott rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brand 

  

synthetic fuel 

  

operations 

  

our synthetic fuel operation currently consists of our interest in four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” two of which are located at a coal mine in saline county illinois and two of which are located at a coal mine in jefferson county alabama we plan to relocate one of the alabama facilities to a coal mine near evansville indiana over the next 90 days and expect the facility to be fully operational by may 2006 production at this facility will be suspended during the duration of the dismantling transportation and reassembly process three of the four plants are held in one entity synthetic american fuel enterprises ii llc “safe ii” and one of the plants is held in a separate entity synthetic american fuel enterprises i llc “safe i” section 29 provides tax credits for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through 2007 credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007 although the facilities incur significant losses these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under section 29 which reduce our income tax expense 

  

at both the alabama and illinois locations the synthetic fuel operation has longterm site leases at sites that are adjacent to large underground mines as well as barge loadout facilities on navigable rivers in addition with respect to the alabama and illinois locations the synthetic fuel operation has longterm coal purchase agreements with the owners of the adjacent coal mines and longterm synthetic fuel sales contracts with a number of major utilities including the tennessee valley authority and alabama power company these contracts ensure that the operation has longterm agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel through 2007 covering approximately 80 percent of the productive capacity of the facilities at those locations from time to time the synthetic fuel operation supplements these base contracts as opportunities arise by entering into spot contracts to buy coal from these or other coal mines and sell synthetic fuel to these or different end users we expect to negotiate similar site lease coal purchase and synthetic fuel sales contracts for the indiana site the longterm contracts can generally be canceled by us in the event that we choose not to operate the facilities or that the synthetic fuel produced at the facilities does not qualify for tax credits under section 29 

  

although we anticipate that the coal mines adjacent to the synthetic fuel operation’s production sites will be able to fulfill the facilities’ requirements for feedstock coal if our feedstock suppliers become unable to supply the facilities with enough coal to satisfy our requirements for any reason we would have to curtail production which would have a negative impact on our results of operations or negotiate new coal supply agreements with third parties which might not be available on similar terms in addition the synthetic fuel operation has synthetic fuel sale contracts with approximately a dozen customers a number of whom have contracted to purchase in excess of 10 percent of the productive capacity at our alabama and illinois locations although we expect that those customers could be replaced by other purchasers we cannot assure that we would be able to enter into replacement contracts on equivalent terms as a result the failure by one or more of those customers to perform their purchase obligations under those sale contracts could have a material adverse effect on the synthetic fuel operation 

  

the synthetic fuel operation has a longterm operations and maintenance agreement with an experienced manager of synthetic fuel facilities this manager is responsible for staffing the facilities operating and maintaining the machinery and conducting routine maintenance on behalf of the synthetic fuel operation 

  

finally the synthetic fuel operation has a longterm license and binder purchase agreement with headwaters incorporated which permits the operation to utilize a carboxylated polystyrene copolymer emulsion patented by headwaters and manufactured by dow chemical that is mixed with coal to produce a qualified synthetic fuel 

  

as discussed in greater detail below in item 1a “risk factors” the tax credits available under section 29 for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given year are phased out if oil prices in that year are above certain thresholds as a result of high oil prices in the first several weeks of 2006 the synthetic fuel operation elected to suspend production of synthetic fuel in midjanuary 2006 on february 17 2006 we restarted production and have taken steps to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits are phased out in 2006 as a result of high oil prices we will continue to monitor the situation and if circumstances warrant we may again elect to suspend production in the future 

  

our investment 

  

we acquired our initial interest in safe i and safe ii from pacificorp financial services “pacificorp” in october 2001 for 46 million in cash and we began operating the facilities in the first quarter of 2002 we also make annual payments to pacificorp based on the amount of tax credits produced up to a certain threshold 

  

on june 21 2003 we sold an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in both safe i and safe ii we received cash and promissory notes totaling 25 million at closing and we receive additional proceeds based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser 

  

as a result of a put option associated with the june 21 2003 sale of a 50 percent ownership interest we consolidated the two synthetic fuel joint ventures from that date through november 6 2003 effective november 7 2003 because the put option was voided we began accounting for the synthetic fuel joint ventures using the equity method of accounting beginning march 26 2004 as a result of adopting fin 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” we have again consolidated the synthetic fuel joint ventures and we reflect our partner’s share of the operating losses as minority interest 

  

on october 6 2004 we entered into amendment agreements with our synthetic fuel partner that resulted in a shift in the allocation of tax credits between us our partner increased its allocation of tax credits generated by the safe i synthetic fuel facility from approximately 50 percent to 90 percent through march 31 2005 and paid a higher price per tax credit to us for that additional share of tax credits effective april 1 2005 our partner’s share of the tax credits from safe i returned to approximately 50 percent also on october 6 2004 our partner reduced its allocation of tax credits generated by the three safe ii synthetic fuel facilities from approximately 50 percent to roughly 8 percent through december 31 2004 and to 1 percent from january 1 2005 through may 31 2005 effective june 1 2005 our partner’s share of the tax credits from the safe ii facilities returned to approximately 50 percent 

  

in the 2005 third quarter we entered into another amendment agreement with our synthetic fuel partner that gave our partner the right to have its approximately 50 percent ownership interest in safe ii redeemed on november 30 2005 or december 31 2005 our partner exercised the option to have its interest in safe ii redeemed effective on december 31 2005 subsequent to our 2005 fiscal yearend as a result we now own all of the interests in safe ii in consideration for the redeemed interest we forgave the remaining outstanding promissory note balance of approximately 8 million related to our partner’s initial purchase of the interest in safe ii and our partner was relieved of the obligation to make further earnout payments with respect to safe ii for periods after december 31 2005 on that date we also eliminated our partner’s minority interest in safe ii which was 7 million 

  

as a result of the redemption of our partner’s interest in safe ii with respect to the period beginning january 1 2006 we will be allocated 100 percent of the operating losses associated with the facilities owned by safe ii we will receive 100 percent of the tax credits generated by those facilities and production decisions with respect to those facilities will be made based on our 100 percent ownership 

  

internal revenue service determinations 

  

on november 7 2003 the united states internal revenue service “irs” issued private letter rulings to the synthetic fuel joint ventures confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the facilities is a “qualified fuel” under section 29 and that the resulting tax credit may be allocated among the members of the synthetic fuel joint ventures 

  

in july 2004 irs field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment and later a summary report to pacificorp that included a challenge to the placedinservice dates of the three safe ii synthetic fuel facilities one of the conditions to qualify for tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code is that the production facility must have been placed in service before july 1 1998 on june 7 2005 the irs national office issued a technical advice memorandum confirming that the three safe ii synthetic fuel facilities that were under irs review met the placedinservice requirement under section 29 of the internal revenue code

 item 1a risk factors 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

we make forwardlooking statements in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements including risks and uncertainties described below and other factors that we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

  

risks and uncertainties 

  

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the company and its financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

  

the lodging industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for customers we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas this could limit our operating margins diminish our market share and reduce our earnings 

  

we are subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel timeshare and corporate apartment industries the profitability of the hotels vacation timeshare resorts and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand and therefore the prices we are able to obtain for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profit of our lodging businesses in addition reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans guarantees and minority equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage even where such factors do not reduce demand our profit margins may suffer if we are unable to fully recover increased operating costs from our customers 

  

the uncertain pace and duration of the current growth environment in the lodging industry will continue to impact our financial results and growth both the company and the lodging industry were hurt by several events occurring over the last few years including the global economic downturn the terrorist attacks on new york and washington in september 2001 the global outbreak of sars in 2003 and military action in iraq business and leisure travel decreased and remained depressed as some potential travelers reduced or avoided discretionary travel in light of increased delays and safety concerns and economic declines stemming from an erosion in consumer confidence although both the lodging and travel industries have now largely recovered the duration pace and full extent of the current growth environment remains unclear moreover the aftermath of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma and any negative longterm effect that gulf coast recovery efforts may have on the us economy could set back or impede the progress of the industry’s and our recovery accordingly our financial results and growth could be harmed if that recovery stalls or is reversed 

  

our lodging operations are subject to international national and regional conditions because we conduct our business on a national and international platform our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies in recent years our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from recent economic conditions the military action in iraq and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future economic performance is similarly subject to the uncertain magnitude and duration of the economic recovery in the united states the prospects of improving economic performance in other regions the unknown pace of any business travel recovery that results and the occurrence of any future incidents in the countries in which we operate 

  

actions by organized labor could reduce our profits in certain major market cities employees at certain of our managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2006 these agreements affect 14 hotels in new york san francisco los angeles waikiki beach and boston potential labor activities could cause the diversion of business to hotels that are not involved in the negotiations loss of group business in the affected cities and perhaps other cities andor increased labor costs in 2005 affected hotels in these cities contributed approximately 2 percent of our combined base management incentive management and franchise fee revenue in 2005 we earned approximately 6 percent of our combined base management incentive management and franchise fee revenue from downtown hotels union and nonunion in affected markets 

  

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue moreover we may not be able to enter into future collaborations or to renew or enter into agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those under existing collaborations and agreements 

  

we may have disputes with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may in some instances be subject to interpretation and may give rise to disagreements we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but have not always been able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has in the past resulted in litigation and could do so in the future 

  

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

  

we depend on capital to buy and maintain hotels and we may be unable to access capital when necessary in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and maintenance of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control our ability to recover loan and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from owners through the proceeds of hotel sales refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital 

  

our development activities expose us to project cost completion and resale risks we develop new hotel timeshare fractional ownership and personal residence ownership properties both directly and through partnerships joint ventures and other business structures with third parties our involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks including that 1 construction delays cost overruns or acts of god such as earthquakes hurricanes floods or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations 2 we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for projects that are not pursued to completion 3 conditions within capital markets may limit our ability or that of third parties with whom we do business to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or development of future properties and 4 properties that we develop could become less attractive due to changes in mortgage rates market absorption or oversupply with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices we anticipate 

  

development activities which involve our coinvestment with third parties may further increase completion risk or result in disputes which could increase project costs or impair project operations partnerships joint ventures and other business structures involving our coinvestment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships joint ventures or similar structures actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay increased project costs or operational difficulties following project completion 

  

in the event of damage to or other potential losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise potential losses may not be covered by insurance we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit both the scope of property and liability insurance coverage that we can obtain and our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods or terrorist acts that may be uninsurable or may be too expensive to justify insuring against as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition we may carry insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could also result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

  

risks relating to acts of god contagious disease terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues acts of god such as hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters and the spread of contagious diseases such as sars and avian flu in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers can cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging wars including the potential for war terrorist activity including threats of terrorist activity political unrest and other forms of civil strife and geopolitical uncertainty can have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our revenues 

  

an increase in the use of thirdparty internet reservation services could adversely impact our revenues  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries such as travelocitycom ®  expediacom ® and pricelinecom ®  serving both the leisure and increasingly the corporate travel and group meeting sectors while marriott’s look no further ® best rate guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of these internet travel intermediaries to undercut the published rates of marriott hotels these internet travel intermediaries continue their attempts to commoditize hotel rooms by aggressively marketing to pricesensitive travelers and corporate accounts and increasing the importance of general indicators of quality such as “threestar downtown hotel” at the expense of brand identification these agencies hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their travel services rather than to our lodging brands although we expect to continue to maintain and even increase the strength of our brands in the online marketplace if the amount of sales made through internet intermediaries increases significantly our business and profitability may be harmed 

  

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively our timeshare segment and to a lesser extent our other lodging segments rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing and mass mailings recent initiatives such as the national do not call registry and various state laws regarding marketing and solicitation including antispam legislation have created some concern about the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing and mass mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products we also obtain lists of potential customers from travel service providers with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly if the acquisition of these lists were outlawed or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

  

operating risks at our synthetic fuel operations could reduce the tax benefits generated by those facilities the company owns an interest in four synthetic fuel production facilities the internal revenue code provides tax credits for the production and sale of synthetic fuels produced from coal through 2007 although our synthetic fuel facilities incur significant losses those losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated which reduce our income tax expense problems related to supply production and demand at any of the synthetic fuel facilities the power plants and other end users that buy synthetic fuel from the facilities or the coal mines from which the facilities buy coal could diminish the productivity of our synthetic fuel operations and adversely impact the ability of those operations to generate tax credits 

  

high oil prices in 2006 and beyond could reduce or eliminate the tax credits generated by our synthetic fuel facilities the tax credits available under the internal revenue code for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given year are phased out if the reference price of a barrel of oil for that year falls within a specified price range the “reference price” of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil and is determined for each calendar year by the secretary of the treasury by april 1 of the following year in 2003 and 2004 the reference price was approximately equal to 89 percent of the average price in those years of the benchmark nymex futures contract for a barrel of light sweet crude oil the price range within which the tax credit is phased out was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation in 2004 the phaseout range was 5135 to 6447 because the reference price for a barrel of oil for 2004 was below that range at 3675 there was no reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2004 

  

assuming a 2 percent inflation adjustment factor for 2005 and assuming that the ratio of the reference price to the average wellhead price of the benchmark nymex futures contract remains approximately the same in 2005 as it was in 2004 we currently estimate that because the average nymex price for january through december 2005 was approximately 5671 there was no reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2005 assuming a 2 percent inflation adjustment factor for each of 2005 and 2006 and assuming that the ratio of the reference price to the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract remains the same in 2006 as it was in 2004 we currently estimate that the tax credits available for production and sale of synthetic fuel in 2006 would begin to be phased out if the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract in 2006 exceeds approximately 60 and would be fully phased out if the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract in 2006 exceeds approximately 75 the average price of the benchmark nymex futures contract for 2006 through february 16 2006 was 6436 as a result of high oil prices in the first several weeks of 2006 the synthetic fuel operation elected to suspend production of synthetic fuel in midjanuary 2006 on february 17 2006 we restarted production and have taken steps to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of tax credits are phased out in 2006 as a result of high oil prices we will continue to monitor the situation and if circumstances warrant we may again suspend production in the future 

  

we cannot predict with any accuracy the future price of a barrel of oil if the reference price of a barrel of oil in 2006 or 2007 exceeds the applicable phaseout threshold for those years the tax credits generated by our synthetic fuel facilities in those years could be reduced or eliminated which would have a negative impact on our results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

business and overview 

  

we are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2741 hotels and related facilities our operations are grouped into five business segments fullservice lodging selectservice lodging extendedstay lodging timeshare and synthetic fuel in our lodging business we operate develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 67 countries and territories we also operate and develop marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names 

  

we earn base incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare segment 1 selling timeshare intervals and personal residences 2 operating the resorts and 3 financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals in addition we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own and lease and we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel operations 

  

we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses interest expense and interest income with the exception of our synthetic fuel segment we do not allocate income taxes to our segments as timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains and losses as well as equity earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general administrative and other expenses to each of our segments 

  

similar to conditions that existed last year lodging supply growth in the united states was low during 2005 while demand growth was high as a result both occupancies and average daily rates continued to rise transient demand both business and leisure was strong in 2005 and we experienced particularly robust pricing power associated with that demand in addition our group rates are continuing to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is being replaced with business negotiated at higher rates in the united states demand was strongest in the eastern and western regions while the midwestern and south central regions experienced more moderate increases in demand demand was also strong in hawaii 

  

the weak us dollar in relation to other currencies helped increase travel versus the prior year into the united states in addition we saw increased demand associated with us vacationers who were also impacted by the weak us dollar and traveled domestically instead of abroad outside of the united states we experienced stronger demand versus the prior year particularly in china hong kong the middle east mexico and the caribbean demand in europe and south american countries continues to remain less robust as some economies continue to emerge from a slowdown

consolidated results 

  

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

continuing operations 

  

revenues 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

revenues increased 14 percent to 11550 million in 2005 from 10099 million in 2004 as a result of strong demand for hotel rooms worldwide yearoveryear revpar increases were driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent by occupancy improvement the increase in revenue versus the prior year also reflects recognition in 2005 of 14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results but not earned and due until 2005 higher timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue also improved our 2005 revenues in addition revenues increased due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004 as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter further owned and leased revenue increased significantly primarily as a result of the purchase of 13 formerly managed properties see the “ctf holdings ltd” discussion later in this report under the “acquisitions” caption in the “liquidity and capital resources” section 

  

the 14 percent increase in total revenue includes 743 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue to 7671 million in 2005 from 6928 million in the prior year this revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates predominantly to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer as we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income the increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage 

  

we added 45 managed properties 4519 rooms to our system in 2005 including the whitbread properties more fully discussed later in this report under the caption “marriott and whitbread joint venture” in the “liquidity and capital resources” section 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

revenues increased 12 percent to 10099 million in 2004 from 9014 million in 2003 primarily reflecting higher fees related to increased demand for hotel rooms and unit expansion as well as higher timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue 

  

operating income 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

operating income increased 78 million to 555 million in 2005 from 477 million in the prior year primarily as a result of the following items a combined base incentive and franchise fee improvement of 154 million reflecting a stronger demand environment 51 million of stronger timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue and 65 million of stronger owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses the fee improvement versus the prior year also reflects the recognition in 2005 of 14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results but not earned and due until 2005 the increase in owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005 including the ctf properties the strong demand environment in 2005 and our receipt in 2005 of a 10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system 

  

the favorable items noted above were partially offset by 146 million of increased general and administrative expenses and 46 million of lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses increased general and administrative expenses were associated with our lodging segments as unallocated general and administrative expenses were down slightly compared to the prior year the increase in general administrative and other expenses reflects a 94 million pretax charge impacting our fullservice lodging segment primarily due to the noncash writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements discussed more fully later in this report in the “ctf holdings ltd” discussion under the “investing activities cash flows” caption in the “liquidity and capital resources” section and 30 million of pretax expenses associated with our bedding incentive program impacting our fullservice selectservice and extendedstay lodging segments we implemented the bedding incentive program in 2005 to ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by yearend 2005 general and administrative expenses in 2005 also reflect pretax performance termination cure payments of 15 million associated with two properties a 9 million pretax charge associated with three guarantees increased other net overhead costs of 13 million including costs related to the company’s unit growth development and systems and 2 million of increased foreign exchange losses partially offset by 5 million of lower litigation expenses additionally in 2004 general and administrative expenses included a 13 million charge associated with the writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs 

  

operating income for 2005 includes a synthetic fuel operating loss of 144 million versus 98 million of operating losses in the prior year reflecting increased costs and the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue and expenses for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004 as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter for additional information see our “synthetic fuel” segment discussion later in this report 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

operating income increased 100 million to 477 million in 2004 from 377 million in 2003 the increase is primarily due to higher fees which are related both to stronger revpar driven by increased occupancy and average daily rate and to the growth in the number of rooms and strong timeshare results which are mainly attributable to strong demand and improved margins partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses general administrative and other expenses increased 84 million in 2004 to 607 million from 523 million in 2003 primarily reflecting higher administrative expenses in our fullservice selectservice and extendedstay segments 55 million and timeshare segment 24 million primarily associated with increased overhead costs related to 

  

the company’s unit growth and timeshare development and a 10 million reduction in foreign exchange gains offset by 6 million of lower litigation expenses higher general and administrative expenses of 84 million also reflect a 13 million writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs as further discussed in the “2004 compared to 2003” caption under the “selectservice lodging” heading later in this report 

  

gains and other income 

  

the following table shows our gains and other income for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

interest expense 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

interest expense increased 7 million 7 percent to 106 million in 2005 from 99 million in the prior year reflecting increased debt levels which helped to facilitate significantly higher capital expenditures and share repurchases in 2005 interest expense in 2005 reflected our june 2005 series f senior notes issuance and versus the prior year higher commercial paper balances coupled with higher rates included within interest expense for 2005 are charges totaling 29 million relating to interest on accumulated cash inflows from owners in advance of our cash outflows for various programs that we operate on the owners’ behalf including the marriott rewards gift certificates and selfinsurance programs the increase over 2004 is related to higher liability balances and higher interest rates partially offsetting these increases were interest expense declines associated with the payoff at maturity of both our series d senior notes in april 2005 and series b senior notes in november 2005 and the capitalization of more interest associated with the development of timeshare properties 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

interest expense decreased 11 million to 99 million in 2004 from 110 million in the prior year reflecting the repayment of 234 million of senior debt in the fourth quarter of 2003 and other subsequent debt reductions partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction primarily related to our timeshare segment included within interest expense for 2004 and 2003 are charges totaling 11 million and 8 million respectively associated with programs operated on behalf of owners as described above 

  

interest income provision for loan losses and income tax 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased 67 million 46 percent to 79 million in 2005 from 146 million in the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of loans repaid to us the repayments are described more fully under the “loan activity” caption in the “liquidity and capital resources” section later in this report our provision for loan losses increased 36 million versus the prior year reflecting an 11 million charge in 2005 associated with one property and a pretax charge of 17 million in 2005 due to the impairment of our delta air lines inc aircraft leveraged lease as discussed more fully under the “investment in leveraged lease” caption in the “liquidity and capital resources” section later in this report 

  

income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax provision of 94 million for 2005 compared to a tax provision of 100 million for 2004 the difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint ventures which generated a net tax benefit of 190 million in 2005 compared to a net tax benefit of 165 million in 2004 and to a lower tax rate before the impact of the synthetic fuel segment in 2005 as a result of a higher proportion of income in countries with lower effective tax rates higher taxes associated with higher pretax income in 2005 partially offset these favorable tax impacts for additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the synthetic fuel segment later in this report 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

interest income before the provision for loan losses increased 17 million 13 percent to 146 million in 2004 from 129 million in the prior year reflecting higher loan balances including the 200 million note collected in the third quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition by cendant corporation of our interest in the two flags joint venture and higher interest rates we recognized 9 million of interest income associated with the 200 million note which was issued early in the 2004 second quarter our provision for loan losses for 2004 was a benefit of 8 million and includes 3 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at three hotels offset by the reversal of 11 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary 

  

income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax provision of 100 million in 2004 compared to a tax benefit of 43 million in 2003 the difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint venture which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of 165 million in 2004 compared to 245 million in 2003 and to higher pretax income for additional information see the analysis of our results of operations for the synthetic fuel segment later in this report 

  

equity in earnings losses 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

equity in earnings losses of equity method investees increased 78 million from a net loss of 42 million in 2004 to net earnings of 36 million in 2005 twentyeight million dollars of the increase is attributable to our synthetic fuel joint ventures which we reported as an equity investment in the 2004 first quarter versus consolidation of the joint ventures for the periods thereafter for additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the synthetic fuel segment later in this report the remaining 50 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to significant 2005 asset sale gains in several joint ventures producing higher earnings from joint ventures and to a lesser extent the stronger 2005 lodging demand environment and the mix of investments in each year 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

equity in earnings losses of equity method investees decreased to a net loss of 42 million in 2004 from a net loss of 7 million in 2003 in 2003 we recognized equity earnings of 24 million associated with our interest in the two flags joint venture while in 2004 we only recognized 6 million of equity earnings due to the redemption of our interest in addition we had equity income from our synthetic fuel joint ventures of 10 million in 2003 compared to equity losses of 28 million in 2004 the improved business environment in 2004 and the mix of investments versus the prior year favorably impacted our equity income by 21 million partially offsetting the aforementioned negative variances for additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the synthetic fuel segment later in this report 

  

minority interest 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

minority interest increased from a benefit of 40 million in 2004 to a benefit of 45 million in 2005 primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations for 2004 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from march 26 2004 when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of fin 46r through yearend for 2005 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year as further described in the “synthetic fuel” caption in part i item 1 “business” on the first day of our 2006 fiscal year we redeemed our partner’s interest in safe ii accordingly in 2006 minority interest will only represent our partner’s share of the losses in safe i for additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the synthetic fuel segment later in this report 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

minority interest increased from an expense of 55 million in 2003 to a benefit of 40 million in 2004 primarily as a result of the impact of a change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations due to the purchaser’s put option which expired on november 6 2003 minority interest for 2003 reflected our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and its share of the associated tax benefit along with its share of the tax credits from the june 21 2003 sale date through the put option’s expiration date when we began accounting for the ventures under the equity method of accounting for 2004 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from march 26 2004 when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of fin 46r through yearend for additional information see the analysis of results of operations for the synthetic fuel segment later in this report 

  

income from continuing operations 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

income from continuing operations increased 74 million 12 percent to 668 million in 2005 versus the prior year and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 042 17 percent to 289 as discussed above in more detail the increase in income from continuing operations from the prior year is primarily due to the strong demand environment increased owned leased and corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses principally reflecting owned and leased properties acquired in the 2005 third quarter increased timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses stronger equity income higher gains and other income and lower taxes as discussed above in more detail increased general and administrative expenses reflecting among other things the writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs in connection with the ctf transaction and expenses associated with our bedding incentive program lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses lower interest income higher interest expense and a higher loan loss provision partially offset these favorable items 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

income from continuing operations increased 118 million 25 percent to 594 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 053 27 percent to 247 the favorable results were primarily driven by strong hotel demand new unit growth strong timeshare results higher interest income reflecting higher balances and rates lower interest expense due to debt reductions lower loan loss provisions stronger synthetic fuel results and increased gains of 58 million partially offset by higher income taxes excluding the synthetic fuel impact and higher general and administrative expenses 

  

business segments 

  

we are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses interest income provision for loan losses and interest expense with the exception of the synthetic fuel segment we do not allocate income taxes to our segments as timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains as well as equity in earnings losses from our joint ventures and divisional general administrative and other expenses to each of our segments unallocated corporate expenses represent that portion of our general administrative and other expenses and equity in earnings losses that are not allocable to our segments 

  

we have aggregated the brands and businesses presented within each of our segments considering their similar economic characteristics types of customers distribution channels and the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment

marriott lodging 

  

lodging includes our fullservice selectservice extendedstay and timeshare segments we consider lodging revenues and lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies 

  

we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties we calculate revpar by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues 

  

we added 134 properties 21611 rooms and deflagged 25 properties 4755 rooms in 2005 most of the deflagged properties were fairfield inn properties 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

lodging reported financial results of 1019 million in 2005 compared to 835 million in 2004 and revenues of 11129 million in 2005 a 14 percent increase from revenues of 9778 million in 2004 the results as compared to the prior year reflect a 154 million 18 percent increase in base franchise and incentive fees from 873 million in 2004 to 1027 million in 2005 stronger timeshare sales and services revenue net of direct expenses stronger owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses improved equity income and higher gains the increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher revpar for comparable rooms primarily resulting from both domestic and international rate increases and new unit growth incentive management fees increased 59 million 42 percent in 2005 versus the prior year reflecting the impact of increased travel worldwide driving strong property level profits the increase also reflects recognition in 2005 of 14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results but not earned and due until 2005 in 2005 50 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 32 percent in 2004 increased general and administrative expenses of 146 million as discussed in the earlier “operating income” discussion partially offset these improvements 

  

systemwide revpar which includes data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties for comparable north american properties increased 95 percent and revpar for our comparable north american companyoperated properties increased 98 percent systemwide revpar for comparable international properties increased 119 percent and revpar for comparable international companyoperated properties increased 110 percent worldwide revpar for comparable companyoperated properties increased 101 percent while worldwide revpar for comparable systemwide properties increased 99 percent in addition worldwide comparable managed propertylevel house profit margins increased 180 basis points 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

we added 166 properties 27038 rooms and deflagged 42 properties 7335 rooms from yearend 2003 to yearend 2004 most of the deflagged properties were fairfield inn properties in addition 210 properties 28081 rooms exited our system as a result of the sale of the ramada international hotels  resorts franchised brand 

  

lodging reported financial results of 835 million in 2004 compared to 702 million in 2003 and revenues of 9778 million in 2004 a 12 percent increase from revenues of 8712 million in 2003 the results reflect a 131 million 18 percent increase in base franchise and incentive fees from 742 million in 2003 to 873 million in 2004 favorable timeshare segment results and increased gains and joint venture results of 36 million the increase in base and franchise fees was driven by higher revpar for comparable rooms primarily resulting from both domestic and international occupancy and average daily rate increases and new unit growth in 2004 32 percent of our managed properties paid incentive fees to us versus 29 percent in the prior year 

  

systemwide revpar for comparable north american properties increased 85 percent and revpar for our comparable north american companyoperated properties increased 86 percent systemwide revpar for comparable international properties increased 142 percent and revpar for comparable international companyoperated properties increased 166 percent the increase in incentive management fees during the year primarily reflects the impact of increased international demand particularly in asia and the middle east and increased business at properties throughout north america worldwide revpar for comparable companyoperated properties increased 105 percent while worldwide revpar for comparable systemwide properties increased 96 percent 

  

lodging development 

  

we opened 134 properties totaling 21611 rooms across our brands in 2005 and 25 properties 4755 rooms predominantly fairfield inn properties were deflagged and exited the system highlights of the year included 

  

   

   

   

   

we currently have more than 70000 rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development in our development pipeline and we expect to add approximately 25000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2006 these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see the “forwardlooking statements” and “risks and uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “liquidity and capital resources” caption later in this report 

  

revpar 

  

the following tables show for 2005 and 2004 occupancy average daily rate and revpar for each of our comparable north american principal established brands and for our international properties by either region or brand we have not presented statistics for companyoperated north american fairfield inn properties in these tables because we operate only a limited number of properties as this brand is predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful identified as “nm” in the tables that follow systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties 

  

for north american properties the occupancy average daily rate and revpar statistics used throughout this report for 2005 include the period from january 1 2005 through december 30 2005 the statistics for 2004 include the period from january 3 2004 through december 31 2004 and the statistics for 2003 include the period from january 4 2003 through january 2 2004 except in each case for the ritzcarlton and international properties which includes the period from january 1 through december 31 

  

    

    

         

    

    

         

fullservice lodging includes our marriott hotels  resorts  the ritzcarlton  renaissance hotels  resorts  ramada international and bulgari hotels  resorts brands as discussed more fully earlier in this report in part i under the ramada international caption in the item 1 “business” section we sold ramada international in 2004 

  

   

2005 compared to 2004 

  

in 2005 across our fullservice lodging segment we added 30 hotels 8326 rooms and deflagged seven hotels 2446 rooms 

  

compared to the prior year our 2005 segment results reflect a 91 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees and 73 million of increased owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses which includes a 10 million termination fee payment to us associated with one property that left our system partially offset by 6 million of severance payments and other costs associated with the temporary closing of a leased property undergoing renovation the increase in fees is largely due to stronger revpar driven primarily by rate increases which favorably impact propertylevel house profits the growth in the number of rooms and the recognition in 2005 of 14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period earnings but not earned and due until 2005 the increase in owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005 all of which we expect to sell in 2006 including the ctf properties 

  

further impacting segment results gains and other income was 5 million higher than the prior year while equity results increased by 29 million versus the prior year the increase in gains and other income is primarily attributable to the following items 9 million of higher gains in 2005 associated with the sale or repayment before maturity of loans receivable associated with several properties 11 million of increased income in 2005 associated with cost method investments partially offset by the 13 million gain in 2004 associated with the sale of our interest in the two flags joint venture the increase in equity results is primarily attributable to several joint ventures which had significant asset sales in 2005 generating gains and to a lesser extent the favorable variance is also a result of a stronger demand environment and the mix of investments the increase in income associated with cost method investments is primarily related to one new investment in 2005 

  

revpar for fullservice lodging comparable companyoperated north american hotels increased 100 percent to 12127 occupancy for these hotels increased 14 percentage points while average daily rates increased 78 percent to 16658 

  

somewhat offsetting the net favorable variances noted above were 151 million of higher general and administrative costs as noted in the preceding “operating income” discussion during 2005 we recorded a 94 million pretax charge primarily due to the noncash writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of ctf management agreements and we incurred pretax expenses of 18 million related to our bedding incentive program both of which impacted our general and administrative expenses in 2005 we also recorded pretax performance termination cure payments of 15 million associated with two properties and 6 million of pretax charges associated with two guarantees which impacted general and administrative expenses in addition in 2005 there were increased overhead costs associated with unit growth and development 

  

financial results for our international operations were strong across most regions increased demand in 2005 generated an 110 percent revpar increase for comparable companyoperated hotels over 2004 additionally occupancy increased 15 percentage points while average daily rates increased to 13762 in 2005 we experienced strong demand particularly in china mexico the caribbean and egypt the european markets generally continue to remain less robust 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

during 2004 across our fullservice lodging segment we added 33 hotels 10212 rooms and deflagged six hotels 2860 rooms excluding ramada international as a result of the sale of the ramada international hotels  resorts franchised brand 210 properties 28081 rooms exited our system in 2004 the ongoing impact of this sale has not been material to the company 

  

the 2004 segment results reflect an 85 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees partially offset by 46 million of increased administrative costs including costs related to unit growth and development and the receipt in 2003 of 36 million of insurance proceeds the increase in fees is largely due to stronger revpar driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms 

  

gains were up 7 million primarily due to the exercise by cendant of its option to redeem our interest in the two flags joint venture which generated a gain of 13 million and a note receivable which was repaid generating a gain of 5 million joint venture results were up 2 million compared to the prior year for 2003 our equity earnings included 24 million attributable to our interest in the two flags joint venture while our equity in earnings for 2004 reflects only a 6 million impact due to the redemption of our interest the improved business environment contributed to the improvement in joint venture results for 2004 offsetting the decline attributable to the two flags joint venture 

  

revpar for fullservice lodging comparable companyoperated north american hotels increased 84 percent to 10962 occupancy for these hotels increased to 713 percent while average daily rates increased 36 percent to 15366 

  

demand associated with our international operations was strong across most regions generating a 166 percent revpar increase for comparable companyoperated hotels occupancy increased 66 percentage points while average daily rates increased to 12935 financial results increased 37 percent to 140 million due to stronger demand particularly in china hong kong brazil and egypt the european markets generally remain challenging as the economies have been slow to rebound 

  

selectservice lodging includes our courtyard fairfield inn and springhill suites brands 

  

   

2005 compared to 2004 

  

across our selectservice lodging segment we added 66 hotels 8363 rooms and deflagged 18 hotels 2309 rooms in 2005 the deflagged properties were primarily associated with our fairfield inn brand 

  

the increase in revenues for 2005 over the prior year reflects stronger revpar driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms across our selectservice brands the 69 million increase in segment results versus the prior year reflects a 35 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees 4 million of higher owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses 12 million of higher gains and other income a 12 million increase in equity results and 6 million of lower general administrative and other expenses general administrative and other expenses in 2005 included 8 million of higher pretax expenses associated with our bedding incentive program in 2004 as discussed below we wrote off deferred contract acquisition costs impacting general and administrative expenses totaling 13 million the 2005 increase in gains and other income is primarily a result of the 2005 sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 courtyard hotels which generated pretax gains of 17 million a 10 million gain in 2005 associated with the repayment before maturity to us of the loan we made to the courtyard joint venture and increased income of 3 million in 2005 associated with cost method joint ventures partially offset by 20 million of gains in 2004 primarily associated with land sales stronger performance at our reinvented courtyard properties versus nonreinvented properties is also contributing to the increase in revenue and segment results from the prior year for additional information related to the courtyard joint venture see the “courtyard joint venture” caption in “liquidity and capital resources” later in this report 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

across our selectservice lodging segment we added 89 hotels 10556 rooms and deflagged 35 hotels 4395 rooms in 2004 

  

the increase in the selectservice lodging segment revenues for 2004 over the prior year reflects stronger revpar driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms across our selectservice brands base management incentive management and franchise fees increased 31 million and gains were 19 million higher than the prior year reflecting land sales during the year as well as recognition of deferred gains associated with properties we previously owned joint venture results increased by 5 million as a result of the strong business environment these increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs of 13 million most of the increase in administrative costs is associated with a transaction related to our courtyard joint venture discussed more fully later in this report in “liquidity and capital resources” under the heading “courtyard joint venture” as the termination of the existing management agreements associated with the courtyard joint venture was probable in 2004 we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs related to the existing contracts resulting in a charge of 13 million 

  

extendedstay lodging includes our residence inn  towneplace suites  marriott executive apartments and marriott execustay brands 

  

   

2005 compared to 2004 

  

across the extendedstay lodging segment we added 37 hotels 4293 rooms in 2005 

  

our base and incentive management fees in 2005 were 12 million higher than the prior year and our franchise fees principally associated with our residence inn brand also increased 12 million the increase in management and franchise fees is largely due to higher revpar driven by increased demand and to the growth in the number of rooms owned leased corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses declined 12 million compared to a year ago primarily as a result of our execustay brand’s shift toward franchising gains and other income was 11 million lower than last year primarily reflecting gains on sales of real estate in 2004 versus no gains in 2005 general and administrative costs were slightly higher primarily reflecting 2005 pretax expenses of 4 million associated with our bedding incentive program and a 6 million charge in 2005 associated with the settlement of litigation almost entirely offset by lower general administrative and other expenses including lower costs associated with execustay’s shift toward franchising 

  

revpar for selectservice and extendedstay lodging comparable companyoperated north american hotels increased 94 percent to 7649 occupancy for these hotels increased slightly to 738 percent from 726 percent in 2004 while average daily rates increased 87 percent to 10370 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

in 2004 we added 20 hotels 2303 rooms and deflagged one hotel 80 rooms across our extendedstay lodging segment 

  

the decline in our extendedstay lodging segment revenue in 2004 is primarily attributable to the shift in the execustay business from management to franchising we entered into more than 20 new franchise markets in 2004 and only five managed markets remain at the end of 2004 our base management fees increased 4 million and our incentive management fees were essentially flat with last year while our franchise fees principally associated with our residence inn brand increased 9 million the increase in franchise fees is largely due to the growth in the number of rooms and an increase in revpar in addition gains of 10 million in 2004 were favorable to the prior year by 4 million execustay experienced improved results compared to the prior year resulting from increased occupancy primarily in the new york market coupled with lower operating costs associated with the shift in business toward franchising the 2 million increase in general and administrative costs associated with supporting the segment’s hotel brands was more than offset by the 6 million decline in execustay’s general and administrative costs associated with execustay’s shift toward franchising 

  

revpar for selectservice and extendedstay lodging comparable companyoperated north american hotels increased 91 percent to 6866 occupancy for these hotels increased to 726 percent from 700 percent in 2003 while average daily rates increased 44 percent to 9452 

  

timeshare includes our marriott vacation club international the ritzcarlton club grand residences by marriott and horizons by marriott vacation club brands 

  

   

2005 compared to 2004 

  

timeshare revenues of 1721 million and 1502 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively include interval fractional and whole ownership sales base management fees resort rental fees and cost reimbursements timeshare contract sales including sales made by our timeshare joint venture projects which represent sales of timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership products before adjustment for percentage of completion accounting were flat as compared to last year reflecting limited available inventory at several projects in 2005 which are approaching sellout status versus higher contract sales at those projects in the prior year the favorable segment results compared with 2004 reflect a 51 million increase in timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses primarily reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue under the percentage of completion accounting a higher development margin primarily resulting from the mix of units sold and higher financing income reflecting a higher average notes receivable portfolio balance in 2005 in addition compared with 2004 base fees increased 4 million gains increased 6 million equity earnings increased 8 million and general and administrative expenses were flat improved equity results primarily reflect startup losses in 2004 versus earnings in 2005 associated with one joint venture and the increase in gains is attributable to note sales which generated gains of 69 million in 2005 compared to 64 million in 2004 in 2005 we also decided to cease development of one land parcel and we recorded a 7 million charge in conjunction with the writeoff of the previously capitalized costs which impacted our timeshare direct expenses 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

timeshare segment revenues totaled 1502 million and 1279 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively including our three joint ventures contract sales increased 31 percent primarily due to strong demand in south carolina florida hawaii california st thomas us virgin islands and aruba the favorable segment results reflect a 9 percent increase in timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership sales services revenue higher margins primarily resulting from lower marketing and selling costs and the mix of units sold partially offset by 24 million of higher administrative expenses our note sales gain of 64 million was flat compared to the prior year in addition we adjusted the discount rate used in determining the fair value of our residual interests due to current trends in interest rates and recorded a 7 million charge in 2004 reported revenue growth trailed contract sales growth because of a higher proportion of sales in joint venture projects and projects with lower average construction completion 

  

synthetic fuel 

  

see the “synthetic fuel” caption in the part i item 1 “business” section earlier in this report for information related to our synthetic fuel investment and how we have accounted for that investment 

  

the tables below detail the impact of our synthetic fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2005 2004 and 2003 our management evaluates the figures presented in the “before syn fuel” columns because management expects the synthetic fuel segment will no longer have a material impact on our business after the internal revenue code section 29 synthetic fuel tax credits expire at the end of 2007 and because the presentation reflects the results of our core lodging operations management also believes that these presentations facilitate the comparison of our results with the results of other lodging companies however the figures presented in the “before syn fuel” columns are nongaap financial measures may be calculated andor presented differently than presentations of other companies and are not alternatives to operating income total tax provision benefit income from continuing operations or any other operating measure prescribed by us generally accepted accounting principles 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

  

for 2005 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 421 million versus revenue of 321 million for the prior year primarily due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue for the entire 2005 year compared with only three quarters in 2004 as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter 

  

the 18 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to 125 million from 107 million in 2004 is primarily due to our increased proportion of tax credits through may 31 2005 associated with the safe ii facilities that were then under irs review and higher gains and other income partially offset by our decreased proportion of tax credits through march 31 2005 associated with the safe i facility that was not under irs review in addition in 2005 production was slightly lower and raw materials prices were higher than in 2004 gains and other income represents net earnout payments received minority interest increased from a benefit of 40 million in 2004 to a benefit of 47 million in 2005 primarily as a result of the change in the method of accounting for our synthetic fuel operations for 2004 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from march 26 2004 when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of fin 46r through yearend for 2005 minority interest represents our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses for the entire year 

  

the table below details the impact of our synthetic fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2005 and 2004 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003 

  

for 2004 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 321 million versus revenue of 302 million for the prior year primarily due to higher production 

  

the 11 million increase in synthetic fuel income from continuing operations to 107 million in 2004 from 96 million in the prior year is primarily due to slightly higher production in 2004 gains and other income of 28 million represents net earnout payments received in addition equity losses of 28 million include net earnout payments made of 6 million minority interest increased from an expense of 55 million in 2003 to a benefit of 40 million in 2004 primarily as a result of the change in the ownership structure of the synthetic fuel joint ventures following our sale of 50 percent of our interest in the joint ventures minority interest for 2003 reflected our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and its share of the associated tax benefit along with its share of the tax credits from the june 21 2003 sale date through the put option’s expiration date for 2004 minority interest reflected our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from march 26 2004 when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of fin 46r through yearend 

  

the table below details the impact of our synthetic fuel segment on our continuing operations for 2004 and 2003 

  

   

impact of future adoption of accounting standards 

  

statement of position 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” 

  

in december 2004 the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” the “sop” and the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended fas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” and fas no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” to exclude accounting for real estate timesharing transactions from these statements the sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 

  

under the sop we will charge the majority of the costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred we will also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale we will also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations which require us to record any excess profits as a reduction of inventory costs 

  

we estimate that the initial adoption of the sop in our 2006 first quarter which we will report as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our fiscal year 2006 financial statements will result in a onetime noncash aftertax charge of approximately 110 million to 115 million consisting primarily of the writeoff of deferred selling costs and establishing the required reserves on notes we estimate the ongoing impact of the adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial 

  

fas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “fas no 123r” which is a revision of fas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” fas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends fas no 95 “statement of cash flows” we will adopt fas no 123r at the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year we estimate the adoption of fas no 123r using the modified prospective method will result in incremental pretax expense in fiscal year 2006 of approximately 44 million based on our current sharebased payment compensation plans assumptions reflecting currently available information and recent interpretations related to accounting for sharebased awards granted to eligible retirees 

  

discontinued operations 

  

senior living services 

  

we completed the sale of our senior living management business along with a parcel of land to sunrise senior living inc and the sale of nine senior living communities to cnl retirement properties inc in 2003 for 266 million we recorded an aftertax gain on disposal of 19 million and aftertax income from operations of 7 million in 2003 associated with our discontinued senior living services business 

  

distribution services 

  

in 2005 and 2004 we had income net of tax of 1 million and 2 million respectively associated with the distribution services business we exited in 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash requirements and our credit facilities 

  

we are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that provides for aggregate borrowings of 20 billion expiring in 2010 which supports our commercial paper program and letters of credit this facility became effective on june 6 2005 replacing two multicurrency credit agreements in the same aggregate amount which would otherwise have expired in 2006 as with the facilities it replaced borrowings under this new facility bear interest at libor plus a spread based on our public debt rating with the exception of the 2010 expiration date the material terms of the new credit agreement are the same as those of the replaced agreements we classify commercial paper as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

  

at yearend 2005 we had no loans and 93 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility we do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility at yearend 2005 our available borrowing capacity amounted to 1611 billion and reflected borrowing capacity at 20 billion under the credit facility plus our cash balance of 203 million less the letters of credit outstanding under the facility of 93 million and a 499 million reserve for outstanding commercial paper supported by the facility we consider these resources together with cash we expect to generate from operations adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements we periodically evaluate opportunities to sell additional debt or equity securities obtain credit facilities from lenders or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we began issuing shortterm commercial paper in europe in addition to our longstanding commercial paper program in the united states our us and european commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper market as we have no commitments from buyers to purchase our commercial paper we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature 

  

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper 

  

cash from operations 

  

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

  

   

while our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow yeartoyear cash flow varies based on the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we include timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash the following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare business which does not include the portion of income from continuing operations from our timeshare business 

  

   

our ability to sell timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate although we do not expect such a deterioration loans to timeshare owners including a current portion of 33 million totaled 344 million at yearend 2005 loans to timeshare owners including a current portion of 26 million totaled 315 million at yearend 2004 

  

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was roughly one to one at yearend 2005 and 08 to one at yearend 2004 each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover we also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility should we need additional working capital 

  

our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years the calculations of which are detailed in exhibit 12 to this report are as follows 

  

   

investing activities cash flows 

  

capital expenditures and other investments capital expenditures of 780 million in 2005 181 million in 2004 and 210 million in 2003 primarily included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvements to existing properties and systems initiatives included in the 2005 capital expenditures are the properties purchased from ctf holdings ltd as described below over time we have sold lodging properties under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales if we were unable to do so our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans and minority equity investments 

  

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging segments because 1 we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale 

  

during the 2005 third quarter we purchased from ctf holdings ltd and certain of its affiliates collectively “ctf” 13 properties in each case through a purchase of real estate a purchase of the entity that owned the hotel or an assignment of ctf’s leasehold rights and certain joint venture interests from ctf for an aggregate price of 381 million prior to the sale all of the properties were operated by us or our subsidiaries 

  

we plan to sell eight of the properties we have purchased to date to thirdparty owners and the balances related to these properties are classified within the “assets held for sale” and “liabilities of assets held for sale” captions in our consolidated balance sheet one operating lease has terminated we operate the four remaining properties under leases three of which expire by 2012 under the purchase and sale agreement we signed with ctf in the second quarter of 2005 we remain obligated to purchase two additional properties for 17 million the acquisition of which was postponed pending receipt of certain thirdparty consents 

  

on the closing date we and ctf also modified management agreements on 29 other ctfleased hotels 28 located in europe and one located in the united states we became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the renaissance hotel group nv in 1997 we continue to manage 16 of these hotels under new longterm management agreements however due to certain provisions in the management agreements we account for these contracts as operating leases ctf placed approximately 89 million in trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash flow necessary to meet rent payments under these leases in turn we released ctf from their guarantees in connection with these leases approximately 79 million remained in these trust accounts at the end of 2005 our financial statements reflect us as lessee on these hotels minimum lease payments relating to these leases are as follows 32 million in 2006 33 million in 2007 33 million in 2008 33 million in 2009 33 million in 2010 and 231 million thereafter for a total of 395 million 

  

for the remaining 13 european leased hotels ctf may terminate management agreements with us if and when ctf obtains releases from landlords of our backup guarantees pending completion of the ctflandlord agreements we continue to manage these hotels under modified management agreements and remain secondarily liable under certain of these leases ctf has made available €35 million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees as ctf obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system our contingent liability exposure of approximately 217 million will decline 

  

we also continue to manage three hotels in the united kingdom under amended management agreements with ctf and continue to manage 14 properties in asia on behalf of new world development company limited and its affiliates ctf’s principals are officers directors and stockholders of new world development company limited at the closing date the owners of the united kingdom and asian hotels agreed to invest 17 million to renovate those properties 

  

we and ctf also exchanged legal releases effective as of the closing date and litigation and arbitration that was outstanding between the two companies and their affiliates was dismissed 

  

simultaneously with the closing on the foregoing transactions ctf also sold five properties and one minority joint venture interest to sunstone hotel investors inc “sunstone” for 419 million eight properties to walton street capital llc “walton street” for 578 million and two properties to tarsadia hotels “tarsadia” for 29 million in each case as substitute purchasers under our purchase and sale agreement with ctf prior to consummation of the sales we also operated all of these properties at closing walton street and sunstone entered into new longterm management agreements with us and agreed to invest a combined 68 million to further upgrade the 13 properties they acquired the two properties purchased by tarsadia are being operated under shortterm management and franchise agreements 

  

when we signed the purchase and sale agreement for the foregoing transactions in the 2005 second quarter we recorded a 94 million pretax charge primarily due to the noncash writeoff of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of the existing management agreements for properties involved in these transactions as described above we entered into new longterm management agreements with ctf walton street and sunstone at the closing of the transactions and we expect to sell most of the properties we acquired subject to longterm management agreements 

  

in 2005 we also purchased two fullservice properties for aggregate cash consideration of 146 million 

  

dispositions property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 298 million in 2005 402 million in 2004 and 494 million in 2003 property and asset sales in 2005 primarily consisted of land parcel sales including those as described below and we also sold two minority interests in joint ventures 

  

late in 2005 we contributed land underlying an additional nine courtyard hotels worth approximately 40 million to courtyard by marriott land joint venture limited partnership “cbm land jv” a joint venture the majority of which is owned by sarofim realty advisors on behalf of an institutional investor thereby obtaining a 23 percent equity stake in cbm land jv at the same time we completed the sale of a portfolio of land underlying 

  

75 courtyard hotels for approximately 246 million in cash to cbm land jv we recognized a pretax gain of 17 million in 2005 we deferred recognition of 5 million of pretax gain due to our minority interest in the joint venture and we also deferred recognition of 40 million of pretax gain due to contingencies in the transaction documents as those contingencies expire in subsequent years we will recognize additional gains

equity and cost method investments 

  

cash outflows of 231 million in 2005 associated with equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our establishment in the 2005 second quarter of a 5050 joint venture with whitbread plc “whitbread” to acquire whitbread’s portfolio of 46 franchised marriott and renaissance hotels totaling over 8000 rooms and for us to take over management of the entire portfolio of hotels upon the transfer of the hotels to the new joint venture whitbread sold its interest in the 46 hotels to the joint venture for approximately £995 million whitbread received approximately £710 million in cash including £620 million from senior debt proceeds and 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of the joint venture and nonvoting deferred consideration shares valued at £285 million we contributed approximately £90 million 171 million in the second quarter of 2005 for the remaining 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of the joint venture the joint venture is currently discussing the sale of the hotels with a potential purchaser as the joint venture sells the hotels our interest in the joint venture will be redeemed the joint venture expects to sell the hotels in early 2006 subject to longterm management agreements with us

cash from financing activities 

  

debt debt increased 412 million in 2005 from 1325 million to 1737 million at yearend 2005 due to the issuance of 348 million book value of series f senior notes the “series f notes” net commercial paper issuances of 499 million and other debt increases of 69 million partially offset by repayment upon maturity of 200 million for the series b senior notes repayment upon maturity of 275 million for the series d senior notes and the 29 million book value debt decrease associated with the series c and series e debt exchange described below  debt decreased 130 million in 2004 from 1455 million to 1325 million due to the repurchase of all of our remaining zerocoupon convertible senior liquid yield option notes due 2021 also known as lyons totaling 62 million the maturity of 46 million of senior notes and other debt reductions of 22 million 

  

in june 2005 we sold 350 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 percent series f notes we received net proceeds of approximately 346 million from this offering after deducting a discount and underwriting fees and we used these proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes interest on the series f notes is payable on june 15 and december 15 of each year which commenced on december 15 2005 the series f notes will mature on june 15 2012 and we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time or from time to time under the terms provided in the form of 4625 series f note due 2012 

  

in november 2005 we offered to holders of our outstanding 7 percent series e notes due 2008 and to holders of our outstanding 7875 percent series c notes due 2009 collectively “old notes” an opportunity to exchange into new 581 percent series g notes and issued new series g notes in the aggregate total of 427 million to replace old notes that had been validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn comprised of 203 million of the series e notes and 224 million of the series c notes in addition we paid an exchange price of 31 million 9 million for the series e notes and 22 million for the series c notes which was equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal on the old notes furthermore holders who had old notes accepted for exchange received a cash payment of 7 million representing accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the settlement date 

  

the exchanges are not considered to be extinguishments and accordingly the exchange price payment along with the existing unamortized discounts associated with the series c notes and series e notes are being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the replacement debt instrument using the interest method all other thirdparty costs related to the exchange were expensed as incurred

courtyard joint venture 

  

during the 2005 second quarter sarofim realty advisors “sarofim” on behalf of an institutional investor completed the acquisition of a 75 percent interest in the courtyard joint venture and we signed new longterm management agreements with the joint venture the transaction has accelerated the pace of reinventions and upgrades at the joint venture’s 120 hotels the termination of the previous management agreements was probable at yearend 2004 accordingly in 2004 we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs relating to the management agreements which existed at that time resulting in a charge of 13 million 

  

prior to sarofim’s acquisition we and host marriott owned equal shares in the 120property joint venture with the addition of the new equity our interest in the joint venture declined to approximately 21 percent and host marriott’s interest declined to less than 4 percent as part of the completed transaction our mezzanine loan to the joint venture including capitalized interest totaling approximately 269 million was repaid 

  

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of yearend 2005 

  

   

our guarantees listed above include 69 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows andor proceeds from the sale of hotels 

  

the guarantees above include 320 million related to senior living services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds and cnl is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds prior to the sale of the senior living services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003 these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by the company of obligations of consolidated senior living services subsidiaries sunrise and cnl have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds we do not expect to fund under these guarantees 

  

the guarantees above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the renaissance hotel group nv in 1997 consisting of annual rent payments of approximately 20 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term plus available extensions of approximately 217 million we are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations since we assumed these guarantees we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future 

  

in addition to the guarantees noted above as of yearend 2005 our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to 11 million we expect to fund 5 million of those commitments within one year we do not expect to fund the remaining 6 million of commitments which expire as follows 4 million within one year and 2 million after five years 

  

in 2005 we assigned to a thirdparty our previous commitment to fund up to 129 million to the courtyard joint venture for the primary purpose of funding the costs of renovating its properties in 2005 and 2006 under the agreement the thirdparty assumed the lending obligation to the venture as of yearend 2005 we funded 1 million and the thirdparty funded 22 million under this loan commitment the commitment to fund is reduced to 27 million in september 2006 and expires in december 2009 in total we expect that no more than 104 million of the 129 million commitment will be funded and other than the 1 million we already funded we expect the thirdparty to provide all future fundings we do not anticipate making further fundings ourselves but remain secondarily obligated to the courtyard joint venture if the thirdparty fails to fund at yearend 2005 that secondary obligation totaled 106 million and is not reflected in our outstanding loan commitments discussed in the preceding paragraph 

  

at yearend 2005 we also have commitments to invest 27 million of equity for minority interests in three partnerships which plan to purchase both fullservice and selectservice hotels in the united states and canada 

  

at yearend 2005 we also had 93 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf the majority of which related to our selfinsurance programs surety bonds issued on our behalf as of yearend 2005 totaled 546 million the majority of which were requested by federal state or local governments related to our timeshare and lodging operations and selfinsurance programs 

  

as part of the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow 

  

related party transactions 

  

we have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management andor franchise services and receive a fee in addition in some cases we provide loans preferred equity or guarantees to these entities

marriott rewards 

  

marriott rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program marriott rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations purchases of timeshare interval fractional and whole ownership products and to a lesser degree through participation in affiliated partners’ programs such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies points which we track on members’ behalf can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations airline tickets airline frequent flyer program miles rental cars and a variety of other awards however points cannot be redeemed for cash we provide marriott rewards as a marketing program to participating properties we charge the cost of operating the program including the estimated cost of award redemption to properties based on members’ qualifying expenditures 

  

we defer revenue received from managed franchised and marriottownedleased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation we determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed these judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points 

  

our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program including marketing promotion communication with and performing member services for the marriott rewards members due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from properties in connection with the marriott rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed we recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded upon the redemption of points we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed 

  

valuation of goodwill 

  

we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset we evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur we record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value 

  

loan loss reserves 

  

we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows which assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur or the estimated fair value of the collateral we apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy where we determine that a loan is impaired we recognize interest income on a cash basis at yearend 2005 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 184 million we have a 103 million allowance for credit losses leaving 81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses at yearend 2004 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 181 million during 2005 and 2004 our average investment in impaired loans totaled 182 million and 161 million respectively 

  

legal contingencies 

  

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances 

  

income taxes 

  

we record the current year amounts payable or refundable as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 

  

changes in existing laws and rates and their related interpretations and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates

other activities 

  

marriott golf manages 31 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners 

  

we operate 18 systemwide hotel reservation centers 10 in the united states and canada and eight in other countries and territories that handle reservation requests for marriott lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others additionally we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further best rate guarantee which gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone reservation system our web site or any other reservation channel our strong marriott rewards loyalty program and our informationrich and easy to use marriottcom web site all encourage customers to make reservations using the marriott web site we have complete control over our inventory and pricing and utilize online agents on an asneeded basis the shift of hotel bookings to our web site from other online channels results in higher revenue margins and profitability with over 2600 hotels economies of scale enable us to reduce costs per occupied room drive profits for our owners and increase our fee revenue 

  

our architecture and construction “ac” division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from their management or franchise contracts consistent with thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriottbranded properties on a fee basis 

  

competition 

  

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor there are approximately 675 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

  

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2004 approximately twothirds of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is fairly concentrated with the three largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

  

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators although branding is more common for new hotel development we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

  

based on lodging industry data we have less than an 84 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel 

  

brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room revpar than direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference approximately 34 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

  

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness our management lease and franchise agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings we believe that these ongoing refurbishment programs are adequate to preserve the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties while service excellence is marriott’s hallmark we continually look for new ways to delight our guests currently we are focused on elevating the marriott experience beyond that of a traditional hotel stay to a total guest experience that encompasses exceptional style personal luxury and superior service this approach to hospitality “the new look and feel of marriott now” is influenced by the world’s foremost innovations in design technology culinary expertise service and comfort 

  

this evolution can begin to be seen across all of our brands in new hotel designs exotic destinations enhanced fitness centers sumptuous spas and expanded culinary offerings each brand whether luxury or moderately priced will be more upscale and attuned to customer needs than ever before we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising 

  

the vacation ownership industry is one of the fastest growing segments in hospitality and is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies since entering the timeshare industry in 1984 we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide competition in the timeshare business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts the pricing of timeshare intervals and the availability of program benefits such as exchange programs we believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences combined with our financial strength diverse market presence strong brands and wellmaintained properties will enable us to remain competitive 

  

marriott rewards is a frequent guest program with over 21 million members and nine participating marriott brands the marriott rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 26 participating airline programs we believe that marriott rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in 2004 approximately 40 percent of our room nights were purchased by marriott rewards members in addition the ability of marriott vacation club international timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into marriott rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brand 

  

synthetic fuel 

  

operations 

  

our synthetic fuel operation currently consists of our interest in four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” two of which are located at a coal mine in saline county illinois with the remaining two located at a coal mine in jefferson county alabama three of the four plants are held in one entity and one of the plants is held in a separate entity the synthetic fuel produced at the facilities through 2007 qualifies for tax credits based on section 29 of the internal revenue code credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007 although the facilities incur significant losses these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under section 29 which reduce our income tax expense 

  

at both of the locations the synthetic fuel operation has entered into longterm site leases at sites that are adjacent to large underground mines as well as barge loadout facilities on navigable rivers in addition the synthetic fuel operation has entered into longterm coal purchase agreements with the owners of the adjacent coal mines and longterm synthetic fuel sales contracts with the tennessee valley authority and with alabama power company two major utilities these contracts ensure that the operation has longterm agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel covering approximately 80 percent of the productive capacity of the facilities from time to time the synthetic fuel operation supplements these base contracts as opportunities arise by entering into spot contracts to buy coal from these or other coal mines and sell synthetic fuel to different end users the operation is slightly seasonal as the synthetic fuel is mainly burned to produce electricity and electricity use peaks in the summer in the markets served by the synthetic fuel operation the longterm contracts can generally be cancelled by us in the event that we choose not to operate the facilities or that the synthetic fuel produced at the facilities does not qualify for tax credit under section 29 of the internal revenue code 

  

in addition the synthetic fuel operation has entered into a longterm operations and maintenance agreement with an experienced manager of synthetic fuel facilities this manager is responsible for staffing the facilities operating and maintaining the machinery and conducting routine maintenance on behalf of the synthetic fuel operation 

  

finally the synthetic fuel operation has entered into a longterm license and binder purchase agreement with headwaters incorporated which permits the operation to utilize a carboxylated polystyrene copolymer emulsion patented by headwaters and manufactured by dow chemical that is mixed with coal to produce a qualified synthetic fuel 

  

our investment 

  

we acquired the facilities from pacificorp financial services “pacificorp” in october 2001 for 46 million in cash we began operating these facilities in the first quarter of 2002 

  

on june 21 2003 we sold an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in the synthetic fuel entities we received cash and promissory notes totaling 25 million at closing and we are receiving additional profits that we expect will continue over the life of the ventures based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser 

  

on november 7 2003 the us internal revenue service “irs” issued private letter rulings to the synthetic fuel joint venture confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the facilities is a “qualified fuel” under section 29 of the internal revenue code and that the resulting tax credit may be allocated among the members of the synthetic fuel joint venture 

  

as a result of a put option associated with the june 21 2003 sale of a 50 percent ownership interest we consolidated the two synthetic fuel joint ventures from that date through november 6 2003 effective november 7 2003 because the put option was voided we began accounting for the synthetic fuel joint ventures using the equity method of accounting beginning march 26 2004 as a result of adopting fin 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” we have again consolidated the synthetic fuel joint ventures and we reflect our partner’s share of the operating losses as minority interest 

  

internal revenue service placedinservice challenge 

  

in july 2004 irs field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment and later a summary report to pacificorp that included a challenge to the placedinservice dates of three of the four synthetic fuel facilities owned by one of our synthetic fuel joint ventures one of the conditions to qualify for tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code is that the production facility must have been placed in service before july 1 1998 

  

we strongly believe that all the facilities meet the placedinservice requirement although we are engaged in discussions with the irs and are confident this issue will be resolved in our favor and not result in a material charge to us we cannot assure you as to the ultimate outcome of this matter if ultimately resolved against us we could be prevented from realizing projected future tax credits and cause us to reverse previously utilized tax credits requiring payment of substantial additional taxes since acquiring the plants we have recognized approximately 435 million of tax credits from all four plants through december 31 2004 the tax credits recognized through december 31 2004 associated with the three facilities in question totaled approximately 330 million 

  

on october 6 2004 we entered into amendment agreements with our synthetic fuel partner that result in a shift in the allocation of tax credits between us on the synthetic fuel facility that is not being reviewed by the irs our partner increased its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to 90 percent through march 31 2005 and pays a higher price per tax credit to us for that additional share of tax credits with respect to the three synthetic fuel facilities under irs review our partner reduced its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to an average of roughly 5 percent through march 31 2005 if the irs’ placedinservice challenge regarding the three facilities is not successfully resolved by march 31 2005 our partner will have the right to return its ownership interest in those three facilities to us at that time we will have the flexibility to continue to operate at current levels reduce production andor sell an interest to another party if there is a successful resolution by march 31 2005 our partner’s share of the tax credits from all four facilities will return to approximately 50 percent in any event on march 31 2005 our share of the tax credits from the one facility not under review will return to approximately 50 percent 

  

discontinued operations 

  

senior living services 

  

on december 30 2002 we entered into definitive agreements to sell our senior living management business to sunrise senior living inc “sunrise” and to sell nine senior living communities to cnl retirement properties inc “cnl” and we recorded aftertax charges of 131 million in 2002 associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business we completed the sales to sunrise and cnl in addition to the related sale of a parcel of land to sunrise in march 2003 for 266 million we recorded aftertax gains of 19 million in 2003 

  

as a result of the above transactions we now report this business in discontinued operations 

  

distribution services 

  

in the third quarter of 2002 we completed a strategic review of our distribution services business and decided to exit that business as of january 3 2003 through a combination of sale and transfer of nine facilities and the termination of all operations at four facilities we completed our exit of the distribution services business we recorded aftertax charges of 40 million in 2002 in connection with the decision to exit this business accordingly we now report this business in discontinued operations 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

we make forwardlooking statements in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us forwardlooking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the headings “business and overview” “liquidity and capital resources” and other statements throughout this report preceded by followed by or that include the words “believes” “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “estimates” or similar expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements involve risks uncertainties and assumptions including risks described below and other risks that we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed in our forwardlooking statements we therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forwardlooking statement the forwardlooking statements in this report speak only as of the date of the report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise 

  

risks and uncertainties 

  

we are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on the company and its financial condition you should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other company communications because there is no way to determine in advance whether or to what extent any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business you should give equal weight to each of the following 

  

the lodging industry is highly competitive which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel and timeshare properties for customers we generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors each of our hotel and timeshare brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets our ability to remain competitive and attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality value and efficiency of our lodging products and services from those offered by others if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas this could limit our operating margins diminish our market share and reduce our earnings 

  

we are subject to the range of operating risks common to the hotel timeshare and corporate apartment industries the profitability of the hotels vacation timeshare resorts and corporate apartments that we operate or franchise may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand and therefore the prices we are able to obtain for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments in addition reduced demand for hotels could also give rise to losses under loans guarantees and minority equity investments that we have made in connection with hotels that we manage 

  

the uncertain pace of the lodging industry’s recovery will continue to impact our financial results and growth both the company and the lodging industry were hurt by several events occurring over the last few years including the global economic downturn the terrorist attacks on new york and washington severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and military action in iraq business and leisure travel decreased and remained depressed as some potential travelers reduced or avoided discretionary travel in light of increased delays and safety concerns and economic declines stemming from an erosion in consumer confidence weaker hotel performance reduced management and franchise fees and gave rise to fundings or losses under loans guarantees and minority investments that we have made in connection with some hotels that we manage which in turn has had a material adverse impact on our financial performance although both the lodging and travel industries are recovering the pace duration and full extent of that recovery remain unclear accordingly our financial results and growth could be harmed if that recovery stalls or is reversed 

  

our lodging operations are subject to international national and regional conditions because we conduct our business on a national and international platform our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies in recent years our business has been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from recent economic conditions the military action in iraq and the heightened travel security measures that have resulted from the threat of further terrorism our future economic performance is similarly subject to the uncertain magnitude and duration of the economic recovery in the united states the prospects of improving economic performance in other regions the unknown pace of any business travel recovery that results and the occurrence of any future incidents in the countries in which we operate 

  

our growth strategy depends upon thirdparty ownersoperators and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable  our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners the terms of our management agreements franchise agreements and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors among other things we cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue moreover we may not be able to enter into future collaborations or to renew or enter into agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those under existing collaborations and agreements 

  

we may have disputes with the owners of the hotels that we manage or franchise consistent with our focus on management and franchising we own very few of our lodging properties the nature of our responsibilities under our management agreements to manage each hotel and enforce the standards required for our brands under both management and franchise agreements may in some instances be subject to interpretation and may give rise to disagreements we seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners and joint venture partners but have not always been able to do so failure to resolve such disagreements has in the past resulted in litigation and could do so in the future 

  

our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments  our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised marriott brands is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors such as projected room occupancy growth in demand opposite projected supply territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure 

  

we depend on capital to buy and maintain hotels and we may be unable to access capital when necessary in order to fund new hotel investments as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels both the company and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money the availability of funds for new investments and maintenance of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control our ability to recover loan and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from owners through the proceeds of hotel sales refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital 

  

in the event of damage to or other potential losses involving properties that we own manage or franchise potential losses may not be covered by insurance  we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit both the scope of property and liability insurance coverage that we can obtain and our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes and floods or terrorist acts that may be uninsurable or may be too expensive to justify insuring against as a result we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels in addition we may carry insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment or that of hotel owners or in some cases could also result in certain losses being totally uninsured as a result we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and we could remain obligated for guarantees debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

  

risks relating to acts of god terrorist activity and war could reduce the demand for lodging which may adversely affect our revenues  acts of god such as natural disasters and the spread of contagious diseases in locations where we own manage or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers can cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel and reduce the demand for lodging wars including the potential for war terrorist activity including threats of terrorist activity political unrest and other forms of civil strife and geopolitical uncertainty can have a similar effect any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms timeshare units and corporate apartments or limit the prices that we are able to obtain for them both of which could adversely affect our revenues 

  

increasing use of internet reservation services may adversely impact our revenues  some of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries serving both the leisure and increasingly the corporate travel sectors while marriott’s look no further best rate guarantee has greatly reduced the ability of these internet travel intermediaries to undercut the published rates of marriott hotels these internet travel intermediaries continue their attempts to commoditize hotel rooms by aggressively marketing to pricesensitive travelers and corporate accounts and increasing the importance of general indicators of quality such as “threestar downtown hotel” at the expense of brand identification these agencies hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their travel services rather than to our lodging brands although we expect to continue to maintain and even increase the strength of our brands in the online marketplace if the amount of sales made through internet intermediaries increases significantly our business and profitability may be harmed 

  

changes in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively our timeshare business and to a lesser extent our lodging segments rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing and mass mailings recent initiatives such as the national do not call registry and various state laws regarding marketing and solicitation including antispam legislation have created some concern about the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing and mass mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of timeshare units and other products we also obtain lists of potential customers from travel service providers with whom we have substantial relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly if the acquisition of these lists were outlawed or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to our products could be impaired 

  

activities relating to our synthetic fuel operations could increase our tax liabilities the company earns revenues and generates tax credits from its synthetic fuel operations which create a fuel that qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section 29 of the internal revenue code the performance of the synthetic fuel operations depends in part on our ability to utilize the tax credits which in turn is dependent on our financial performance if our businesses do not generate sufficient profits we might suffer losses associated with generating tax credits that we were unable to utilize in addition the irs field audit team’s challenge to whether three of our synthetic fuel facilities satisfy statutory placedinservice requirements could if ultimately resolved against us prevent us from realizing projected future tax credits and cause us to reverse previously utilized credits requiring payment of substantial additional taxes the ability of our synthetic fuel operations to generate tax credits could also be adversely impacted by the productivity of these operations which may be diminished by problems related to supply production and demand at any of the synthetic fuel facilities the power plants that buy synthetic fuel from the joint venture or the coal mines where the joint venture buys coal and by the reduction or elimination of projected future tax credits for synthetic fuel if average crude oil prices in 2005 and beyond exceed certain statutory thresholds which could affect our ongoing production decisions 

  

obligations associated with our exit from the senior living services business may be larger than expected our agreement to sell the senior living services business provides for indemnification of sunrise senior living inc based on preclosing events and liabilities resulting from the consummation of the transaction the amount of the indemnification obligations depends in large part on actions of third parties that are outside of our control as a result it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the indemnities and the amount of these adjustments and indemnities could be larger than expected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

business and overview 

  

we are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2632 hotels and related facilities our operations are grouped into five business segments fullservice lodging selectservice lodging extendedstay lodging timeshare and synthetic fuel in our lodging business we operate develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories we also operate and develop marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names 

  

we earn base incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare business 1 selling timeshare intervals 2 operating the resorts and 3 financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals in addition we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel joint ventures 

  

we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses interest expense and interest income with the exception of our synthetic fuel segment we do not allocate income taxes to our segments as timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains as well as equity income losses from our joint ventures to each of our segments 

  

lodging supply growth in the united states was low during 2004 while demand growth was high in the united states demand was strong in the eastern and western regions while the midwestern and south central regions experienced more moderate increases in demand demand associated with business travel improved steadily in 2004 and leisure demand remained high the weak us dollar in relation to other currencies particularly the euro resulted in increased travel into the us as overseas trips for many international travelers were less expensive conversely many us vacationers who might have traveled abroad traveled domestically instead as the weak dollar made overseas trips more costly 

  

outside of the us we experienced stronger demand versus the prior year particularly in asia and the middle east while demand in latin america and the caribbean was also good europe remains a challenge as some economies have been slow to rebound 

  

we focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy” our look no further best rate guarantee strong marriott rewards loyalty program and informationrich easy to use web site encourage customers to make reservations through marriottcom we have complete control over our inventory and pricing and utilize online agents on an as needed basis the shift of hotel bookings to our web site from other online channels results in higher revenue margins and profitability 

  

by the end of 2004 we had highspeed internet access available in over 2400 hotels far outpacing our competition and we had wireless internet access in lobbies meeting rooms and public spaces in more than 1900 hotels 

  

consolidated results 

  

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended december 31 2004 january 2 2004 which we refer to as “2003” and january 3 2003 which we refer to as “2002” 

  

continuing operations 

  

revenues 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

revenues increased 12 percent to 10099 million in 2004 primarily reflecting higher fees related to increased demand for hotel rooms and unit expansion as well as strong sales in our timeshare segment 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

revenues increased 7 percent to 9014 million in 2003 reflecting revenue from new lodging properties partially offset by lower demand for hotel rooms and consequently lower fees to us 

  

operating income 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

operating income increased 100 million to 477 million in 2004 the increase is primarily due to higher fees which are related both to stronger revpar driven by increased occupancy and average daily rate and to the 

  

growth in the number of rooms and strong timeshare results which are mainly attributable to strong demand and improved margins partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses general administrative and other expenses increased 84 million in 2004 to 607 million primarily reflecting higher administrative expenses in both our lodging 55 million and timeshare businesses 24 million primarily associated with increased overhead costs related to the company’s unit growth and increased development costs primarily associated with our timeshare segment and a 10 million reduction in foreign exchange gains offset by 6 million of lower litigation expenses 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

operating income increased 17 percent to 377 million in 2003 the favorable comparisons to 2002 include the impact of the 50 million write down of goodwill recorded in 2002 associated with our execustay business the 2003 receipt of 36 million of insurance proceeds associated with lost management fees resulting from the destruction of the marriott world trade center hotel and lower 2003 operating losses from our synthetic fuel operation in 2003 the synthetic fuel business generated operating losses of 104 million compared to 134 million in 2002 operating income in 2003 was hurt by 53 million of lower incentive fees which resulted from the weak operating environment in domestic lodging general administrative and other expenses increased 13 million in 2003 to 523 million reflecting higher litigation expenses related to two continuing and previously disclosed lawsuits partially offset by the impact of the additional week in 2002 our 2002 fiscal year included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2003 the expenses also reflect foreign exchange gains of 7 million compared to losses of 6 million in 2002 

  

gains and other income 

  

the following table shows our gains and other income for the fiscal years ended december 31 2004 january 2 2004 and january 3 2003 

  

   

interest expense 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

interest expense decreased 11 million to 99 million reflecting the repayment of 234 million of senior debt in the fourth quarter of 2003 and other subsequent debt reductions partially offset by lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction primarily related to our timeshare segment 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

interest expense increased 24 million to 110 million reflecting interest on the mortgage debt assumed in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities and lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction primarily related to our timeshare segment in the fourth quarter of 2003 234 million of senior debt was repaid the weighted average interest rate on the repaid debt was 7 percent 

  

interest income provision for loan losses and income tax 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

interest income before the provision for loan losses increased 17 million 13 percent to 146 million reflecting higher loan balances including the 200 million note collected in the third quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition by cendant corporation of our interest in the two flags joint venture and higher interest rates we recognized 9 million of interest income associated with the 200 million note which was issued early in the 2004 second quarter our provision for loan losses for 2004 was a benefit of 8 million and includes 3 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at three hotels offset by the reversal of 11 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary 

  

income from continuing operations before income taxes generated a tax provision of 100 million in 2004 compared to a tax benefit of 43 million in 2003 the difference is primarily attributable to the impact of the synthetic fuel joint venture which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of 165 million in 2004 compared to 245 million in 2003 and to higher pretax income in the third quarter of 2003 we sold a 50 percent interest in our synthetic fuel joint ventures and we currently consolidate the joint ventures 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

interest income increased 7 million 6 percent to 129 million our provision for loan losses for 2003 was 7 million and includes 15 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at six hotels offset by the reversal of 8 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary 

  

income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax benefit of 43 million in 2003 compared to a tax provision of 32 million in 2002 the difference is primarily attributable to the impact of our synthetic fuel operation which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of 245 million in 2003 compared to 208 million in 2002 excluding the impact of the synthetic fuel operation our pretax income was lower in 2003 which also contributed to the favorable tax impact 

  

our effective tax rate for discontinued operations increased from 157 percent to 39 percent due to the impact of the taxes in 2002 associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our senior living services business 

  

minority interest 

  

minority interest increased from an expense of 55 million in 2003 to a benefit of 40 million in 2004 primarily as a result of the change in the ownership structure of the synthetic fuel joint ventures following our sale of 50 percent of our interest in the joint ventures due to the purchaser’s put option which expired on november 6 2003 minority interest for 2003 reflected our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel operating losses and their share of the associated tax benefit along with their share of the tax credits from the june 21 2003 sale date through the put option’s expiration date when we began accounting for the ventures under the equity method of accounting for 2004 minority interest reflects our partner’s share of the synthetic fuel losses from march 26 2004 when we began consolidating the ventures due to the adoption of fin 46r through yearend for additional information see the discussion relating to our “synthetic fuel” segment on page 31 

  

income from continuing operations 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

income from continuing operations increased 25 percent to 594 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27 percent to 247 the favorable results were primarily driven by strong hotel demand new unit growth strong timeshare results higher interest income reflecting higher balances and rates lower interest expense due to debt reductions lower loan loss provisions stronger synthetic fuel results and increased gains of 58 million partially offset by higher income taxes excluding the synthetic fuel impact and higher general and administrative expenses 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

income from continuing operations increased 8 percent to 476 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to 194 synthetic fuel operations contributed 96 million in 2003 compared to 74 million in 2002 our lodging financial results declined 5 million to 702 million in 2003 the comparisons from 2002 benefit from the 50 million pretax charge to write down acquisition goodwill for execustay in 2002 offset by the 44 million pretax gain on the sale of our investment in interval international in 2002 and further benefit from our 2003 receipt of a 36 million insurance settlement for lost management fees associated with the new york marriott world trade center hotel which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks 

  

marriott lodging 

  

we consider lodging revenues and lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies 

  

revenues 

  

  

   

income from continuing operations 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003

lodging development 

  

we opened 144 properties totaling 24380 rooms excluding ramada international across our brands in 2004 and 42 properties 7335 rooms were deflagged and exited the system in addition 210 properties 28081 rooms exited our system as a result of the sale of our ramada international hotels  resorts franchised brand in 2004 highlights of the year included 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we currently have more than 55000 rooms in our development pipeline and expect to add 25000 to 30000 hotel rooms and timeshare units to our system in 2005 we expect to deflag approximately 4000 rooms during 2005 these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control see “forwardlooking statements” above and “liquidity and capital resources” below 

  

revpar 

  

we consider revenue per available room revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the periodoverperiod change in room revenues for comparable properties we calculate revpar by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues 

  

the following table shows occupancy average daily rate and revpar for each of our comparable principal established brands we have not presented statistics for companyoperated north american fairfield inn and springhill suites properties here or in the comparable information for the prior years presented later in this report because we operate only a limited number of properties as both of these brands are predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful for those brands identified as “nm” in the tables below systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties 

  

for north american properties except for the ritzcarlton which includes january through december the occupancy average daily rate and revpar statistics used throughout this report for the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 include the period from january 3 2004 through december 31 2004 while the statistics for the fiscal year ended january 2 2004 include the period from january 4 2003 through january 2 2004 

  

      

    

systemwide international statistics by region are based on comparable worldwide units excluding north america the following table shows occupancy average daily rate and revpar for international properties by regionbrand 

  

        

the following table shows occupancy average daily rate and revpar for each of our principal established brands 

  

        

occupancy average daily rate and revpar by regionbrand for international properties are shown in the following table 

  

        

fullservice lodging 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003 

  

fullservice lodging includes our marriott hotels  resorts  the ritzcarlton  renaissance hotels  resorts  ramada international and bulgari hotels  resorts brands the 2004 segment results reflect an 85 million increase in base management incentive management and franchise fees partially offset by 46 million of increased administrative costs including costs related to unit growth and development and the receipt in 2003 of 36 million of insurance proceeds the increase in fees is largely due to stronger revpar driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms since yearend 2003 across our fullservice lodging segment we have added 33 hotels 10212 rooms and deflagged six hotels 2860 rooms excluding ramada international as a result of the sale of our ramada international hotels  resorts franchised brand 210 properties 28081 rooms exited our system in 2004 the ongoing impact of this sale is not expected to be material to the company 

  

gains were up 7 million primarily due to the exercise by cendant of its option to redeem our interest in the two flags joint venture which generated a gain of 13 million and a note receivable which was repaid generating a gain of 5 million joint venture results were up 2 million compared to the prior year for 2003 our equity earnings included 24 million attributable to our interest in the two flags joint venture while our equity in earnings for 2004 reflects only a 6 million impact due to the redemption of our interest the improved business environment contributed to the improvement in joint venture results for 2004 offsetting the decline attributable to the two flags joint venture 

  

revpar for fullservice lodging comparable companyoperated north american hotels increased 84 percent to 10962 occupancy for these hotels increased to 713 percent while average daily rates increased 36 percent to 15366 

  

demand associated with our international operations was strong across most regions generating a 166 percent revpar increase for comparable companyoperated hotels including the ritzcarlton occupancy increased 66 percentage points while average daily rates increased to 12935 financial results increased 37 percent to 140 million due to stronger demand particularly in china hong kong brazil and egypt the european markets generally remain challenging as the economies have been slow to rebound 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

the 3 percent increase in the fullservice segment results includes the 36 million insurance payment received for lost management fees in connection with the loss of the new york marriott world trade center hotel in the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the 2003 results also reflect an 18 million increase in base management and franchise fees largely due to the growth in the number of rooms across our fullservice lodging segment we added 88 hotels 18442 rooms and deflagged 15 hotels 3152 rooms we typically earn incentive fees only after a managed hotel achieves a minimum level of owner profitability as a result lower revenue and lower propertylevel margins have reduced the number of hotels from which we earn incentive management fees as a result fullservice incentive fees declined 41 million in 2003 

  

revpar for fullservice lodging north american systemwide hotels declined 16 percent to 9057 occupancy for these hotels was flat at 671 percent while average daily rates declined 16 percent to 13492 

  

financial results for our international operations increased 9 percent to 102 million reflecting 21 million of gains associated with the sale of our interests in three joint ventures and favorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by an 8 million charge for guarantee fundings related to a hotel in istanbul a 7 million charge to write down our investment in a joint venture that sold a hotel at a loss in january 2004 and the impact of the war and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars on international travel earlier in the year revpar for our international systemwide hotels declined 24 percent occupancy declined 14 percentage points while average daily rates remained relatively flat at 11754 

  

selectservice lodging 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003 

  

selectservice lodging includes our courtyard fairfield inn and springhill suites brands the increase in revenues over the prior year reflects stronger revpar driven by occupancy and rate increases and the growth in the number of rooms across our selectservice brands base management incentive management and franchise fees increased 31 million and gains were 19 million higher than the prior year reflecting land sales during the year as well as recognition of deferred gains associated with properties we previously owned joint venture results increased by 5 million as a result of the strong business environment these increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs of 13 million most of the increase in administrative costs is associated with a transaction related to our courtyard joint venture discussed more fully below in “liquidity and capital resources” under the heading “courtyard joint venture” we expect to enter into a new longterm management agreement with the joint venture in early 2005 as the termination of the existing management agreement is probable in 2004 we wrote off our deferred contract acquisition costs related to the existing contract resulting in a charge of 13 million across our selectservice lodging segment we have added 89 hotels 10556 rooms and deflagged 35 hotels 4395 rooms since yearend 2003 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

the 31 million decrease in the selectservice lodging segment results reflects the impact of a 9 million reduction in base management incentive management and franchise fees the results also include 14 million of higher equity losses primarily from our courtyard joint venture formed in 2000 which owns 120 courtyard hotels 

  

in 2003 across our selectservice lodging segment we added 66 hotels 8054 rooms and deflagged four hotels 731 rooms over 90 percent of the gross room additions were franchised 

  

extendedstay lodging 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003 

  

extendedstay lodging includes our residence inn  towneplace suites  marriott executive apartments and marriott execustay brands the decline in revenue is primarily attributable to the shift in the execustay business from management to franchising we entered into more than 20 new franchise markets in 2004 and only five managed markets remain at the end of 2004 our base management fees increased 4 million and our incentive management fees were essentially flat with last year while our franchise fees principally associated with our residence inn brand increased 9 million the increase in franchise fees is largely due to the growth in the number of rooms and an increase in revpar since yearend 2003 we have added 20 hotels 2303 rooms and deflagged one hotel 80 rooms across our extendedstay segment in addition gains of 10 million in 2004 were favorable to the prior year by 4 million execustay experienced improved results compared to the prior year resulting from increased occupancy primarily in the new york market coupled with lower operating costs associated with the shift in business towards franchising the 2 million increase in general and administrative costs associated with supporting the segment’s hotel brands was more than offset by the 6 million decline in execustay’s general and administrative costs associated with the shift toward franchising 

  

revpar for selectservice and extendedstay lodging comparable companyoperated north american hotels increased 91 percent to 6866 occupancy for these hotels increased to 726 percent from 700 percent in 2003 while average daily rates increased 44 percent to 9452 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

in 2002 we recorded a 50 million charge in our extendedstay lodging segment to write down the acquisition goodwill for execustay our base and incentive management fees decreased 7 million and our franchise fees increased 6 million in 2003 we added 31 hotels 3837 rooms across our extendedstay lodging segment over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised we deflagged one property 104 rooms and we decreased our execustay brand by 1300 units 

  

revpar for selectservice and extendedstay lodging comparable companyoperated north american hotels decreased 22 percent to 6364 occupancy for these hotels decreased to 700 percent while average daily rates decreased 11 percent to 9098 

  

timeshare 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003 

  

timeshare includes our marriott vacation club international the ritzcarlton club marriott grand residence club and horizons by marriott vacation club international brands timeshare revenues of 1502 million and 1279 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively include interval sales base management fees and cost reimbursements including our three joint ventures contract sales which represent sales of timeshare intervals before adjustment for percentage of completion accounting increased 31 percent primarily due to strong demand in south carolina florida hawaii california st thomas and aruba the favorable segment results reflect a 9 percent increase in timeshare interval sales and services higher margins primarily resulting from lower marketing and selling costs and the mix of units sold partially offset by 24 million of higher administrative expenses our note sales gain of 64 million was flat compared to the prior year in addition we adjusted the discount rate used in determining the fair value of our residual interests due to current trends in interest rates and recorded a 7 million charge in 2004 reported revenue growth trailed contract sales growth because of a higher proportion of sales in joint venture projects and projects with lower average construction completion 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

our timeshare segment results decreased 19 percent to 149 million while revenues increased 12 percent note sale gains in 2003 were 64 million compared to 60 million in 2002 contract sales increased 16 percent and were strong at timeshare resorts in the caribbean hawaii and south carolina and soft in lake tahoe orlando and williamsburg the comparison to 2002 reflects the 44 million gain in 2002 on the sale of our investment in interval international timeshare revenues of 1279 million and 1147 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively includes interval sales base management fees and cost reimbursements 

  

synthetic fuel 

  

for 2004 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 321 million and income from continuing operations of 107 million comprised of operating losses of 98 million and equity losses of 28 million which included net earnout payments made of 6 million entirely offset by net earnout payments received of 28 million a 21 million tax benefit tax credits which amounted to 144 million and a minority interest benefit of 40 million reflecting our partner’s share of the operating losses 

  

for 2003 the synthetic fuel operation generated revenue of 302 million and income from continuing operations of 96 million comprised of operating losses of 104 million which included net earnout payments made of 14 million minority interest expense of 55 million reflecting our partner’s share of the tax credits tax benefits and operating losses entirely offset by equity income of 10 million a 34 million tax benefit and tax credits which amounted to 211 million 

  

the 11 million increase in income from continuing operations attributable to the synthetic fuel operation to 107 million from 96 million is primarily due to slightly higher production in 2004 

  

in july 2004 internal revenue service “irs” field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment and later a summary report to pacificorp the previous owner of the synthetic fuel facilities that included a challenge to the placedinservice dates of three of the four synthetic fuel facilities owned by one of our synthetic fuel joint ventures one of the conditions to qualify for tax credits under section 29 of the internal revenue code is that the production facility must have been placedinservice before july 1 1998 

  

we strongly believe that all the facilities meet the placedinservice requirement although we are engaged in discussions with the irs and are confident this issue will be resolved in our favor and not result in a material charge to us we cannot assure you as to the ultimate outcome of this matter if ultimately resolved against us we could be prevented from realizing projected future tax credits and cause us to reverse previously utilized tax credits requiring payment of substantial additional taxes since acquiring the plants we have recognized approximately 435 million of tax credits from all four plants through december 31 2004 the tax credits recognized through december 31 2004 associated with the three facilities in question totaled approximately 330 million 

  

on october 6 2004 we entered into amendment agreements with our synthetic fuel partner that result in a shift in the allocation of tax credits between us on the synthetic fuel facility that is not being reviewed by the irs our partner increased its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to 90 percent through march 31 2005 and pays a higher price per tax credit to us for that additional share of tax credits with respect to the three synthetic fuel facilities under irs review our partner reduced its allocation of tax credits from approximately 50 percent to an average of roughly 5 percent through march 31 2005 if the irs’ placedinservice challenge regarding the three facilities is not successfully resolved by march 31 2005 our partner will have the right to return its ownership interest in those three facilities to us at that time we will have the flexibility to continue to operate at current levels reduce production andor sell an interest to another party if there is a successful resolution by march 31 2005 our partner’s share of the tax credits from all four facilities will return to approximately 50 percent in any event on march 31 2005 our share of the tax credits from the one facility not under review will return to approximately 50 percent 

  

impact of future adoption of accounting standards 

  

statement of position 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” 

  

in december 2004 the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position “sop” 042 “accounting for real estate timesharing transactions” and the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended financial accounting standards “fas” no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” and fas no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” to exclude accounting for real estate timesharing transactions from these statements the sop will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 

  

under the sop the majority of the costs incurred to sell timeshares will be charged to expense when incurred in regards to notes receivable issued in conjunction with a sale an estimate of uncollectibility that is expected to occur must be recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time that profit is recognized on a timeshare sale rental and other operations during holding periods must be accounted for as incidental operations which require that any excess costs be recorded as a reduction of inventory costs 

  

we estimate that the initial adoption of the sop which will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our fiscal year 2006 financial statements will result in a noncash onetime pretax charge of approximately 150 million consisting primarily of the writeoff of deferred selling costs and establishing the required reserve on notes we estimate that the ongoing impact of adoption will not be significant 

  

fas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “fas no 123r” which is a revision of fas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” fas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends fas no 95 “statement of cash flows” we will adopt fas no 123r at the beginning of our 2005 third quarter 

  

fas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recorded as an expense based on their fair values the grantdate fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using an optionpricing model adjusted for any unique characteristics of a particular instrument if an equity award is modified after the grant date incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 

  

we estimate that adoption of fas no 123r using the modified prospective method will result in incremental pretax expense in fiscal year 2005 of approximately 20 million based on our current sharebased payment compensation plans and a midyear adoption 

  

discontinued operations 

  

senior living services 

  

on december 30 2002 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to sunrise and to sell nine senior living communities to cnl we recorded aftertax charges of 131 million in 2002 associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business we completed the sales to sunrise and cnl and a related sale of a parcel of land to sunrise in march 2003 for 266 million we recorded aftertax gains of 19 million in 2003 

  

distribution services 

  

in the third quarter of 2002 we completed a previously announced strategic review of our distribution services business and decided to exit that business we completed that exit during the fourth quarter of 2002 through a combination of transferring certain facilities closing other facilities and other suitable arrangements we recorded aftertax charges of 40 million in 2002 in connection with the decision to exit this business

we are party to two multicurrency revolving credit agreements that provide for borrowings of up to 2 billion expiring in 2006 15 billion expiring in july and 500 million expiring in august which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit at december 31 2004 we had no loans outstanding under these facilities fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities borrowings under these facilities bear interest at libor plus a spread based on our public debt rating at december 31 2004 our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to approximately 27 billion we consider these resources together with cash we expect to generate from operations adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements including the repayment of our series d senior notes totaling 275 million and our series b senior notes totaling 200 million both of which mature in 2005 

  

we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facilities which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper 

  

cash from operations 

  

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

  

   

while our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing affects annual amounts we include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash the following table shows the net operating activity from our timeshare business which excludes the portion of net income from our timeshare business as that number is a component of income from continuing operations 

  

   

our ability to sell timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate although we do not expect such a deterioration 

  

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 08 to 1 at both december 31 2004 and january 2 2004 each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover we also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities should we need additional working capital 

  

investing activities cash flows 

  

capital expenditures and other investments capital expenditures of 181 million in 2004 210 million in 2003 and 292 million in 2002 primarily included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties as well as improvement to existing properties and systems initiatives over time we have sold lodging properties under development subject to longterm management agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales if we were unable to do so our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans and minority equity investments 

  

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging segments because 1 we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus current hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale 

  

dispositions property and asset sales generated cash proceeds of 402 million in 2004 494 million in 2003 and 729 million in 2002 in 2004 we closed on the sales of two hotels and we continue to operate both of the hotels under longterm management agreements we also disposed of 30 land parcels our ramada international hotels  resorts franchised brand our interest in the two flags joint venture two other minority interests in joint ventures and other miscellaneous assets 

  

loan activity we have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise typically to facilitate the development of a new hotel over time we expect these owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit we have also made loans to the synthetic fuel joint venture partner and to the purchaser of our senior living business loan collections net of advances during 2004 amounted to 147 million loans outstanding excluding timeshare notes totaled 942 million at december 31 2004 996 million at january 2 2004 and 944 million at january 3 2003 unfunded commitments aggregating 42 million were outstanding at december 31 2004 of which we expect to fund 12 million in 2005 and 26 million in total

a summary of our other investing outflows is shown in the table below 

  

   

cash from financing activities 

  

debt 

  

debt decreased 130 million in 2004 from 1455 million to 1325 million due to the repurchase of all of our remaining zerocoupon convertible senior liquid yield option notes due 2021 also known as lyons “the lyons” totaling 62 million the maturity of 46 million of senior notes and other debt reductions of 22 million debt decreased by 319 million in 2003 due to the 200 million repayment at maturity of series a debt in november 2003 and the net pay down of 161 million of commercial paper and other debt 

  

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2004 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 75 percent and an average maturity of approximately 25 years the ratio of fixedrate longterm debt to total longterm debt was slightly lower than one as of december 31 2004 at december 31 2004 we had longterm public debt ratings of bbb from standard and poor’s and baa2 from moody’s

pending transaction 

  

courtyard joint venture 

  

in december 2004 we and host marriott announced the signing of a purchase and sale agreement by which an institutional investor would obtain a 75 percent interest in the courtyard joint venture we expect the transaction which is subject to certain closing conditions to close in early 2005 although we cannot assure you that the sale will be completed currently we and host marriott own equal shares in the 120 property joint venture and with the addition of the new equity our percentage interest in the joint venture will decline from 50 percent to 21 percent as a result of the transaction the pace of the courtyard hotel reinventions a program that renovates and upgrades courtyard hotels will be accelerated 

  

upon closing of the transaction 

  

   

   

   

   

on an ongoing basis we expect our interest income will decline as a result of the repayment of the mezzanine loan and we expect lower book losses from the joint venture due to the reduction of our equity interest and improved performance at the hotels on a longterm basis we expect that the courtyard reinventions will promote continued growth and maintain and enhance customer preference 

  

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 

  

    

the following table summarizes our commitments as of december 31 2004 

  

   

our guarantees listed above include 91 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows andor proceeds from the sale of hotels 

  

the guarantees above include 349 million related to senior living services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds and cnl is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds prior to the sale of the senior living services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003 these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by the company of obligations of consolidated senior living services subsidiaries sunrise and cnl have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds we do not expect to fund under these guarantees 

  

the guarantees above also include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the renaissance hotel group nv in 1997 consisting of annual rent payments of approximately 63 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term plus available extensions of approximately 156 billion we are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations since we assumed these guarantees we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future 

  

in addition to the guarantees noted above as of december 31 2004 our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to 42 million at december 31 2004 we expect to fund 12 million of those commitments within one year and 14 million in the following year we do not expect to fund the remaining 16 million of commitments which expire as follows 14 million within one year and 2 million after five years 

  

at december 31 2004 we also have commitments to invest 37 million of equity for a minority interest in two partnerships which plan to purchase both fullservice and selectservice hotels in the united states 

  

at december 31 2004 we also had 96 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf the majority of which related to our selfinsurance programs surety bonds issued on our behalf as of december 31 2004 totaled 486 million the majority of which were requested by federal state or local governments related to our timeshare and lodging operations and selfinsurance programs 

  

as part of the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow 

  

related party transactions 

  

we have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management andor franchise services and receive a fee in addition in some cases we provide loans preferred equity or guarantees to these entities the following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties 

  

  

   

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

  

   

   

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them 

  

marriott rewards 

  

marriott rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program marriott rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our lodging operations purchases of timeshare intervals and to a lesser degree through participation in affiliated partners’ programs such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies 

  

we defer revenue received from managed franchised and marriottownedleased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation we determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed these judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points 

  

our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program including marketing promotion communication with and performing member services for the marriott rewards members due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the marriott rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed we recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded 

  

upon the redemption of points we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed 

  

valuation of goodwill 

  

we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset we evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur we record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value 

  

loan loss reserves 

  

we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows which assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur or the estimated fair value of the collateral we apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy where we determine that a loan is impaired we recognize interest income on a cash basis at december 31 2004 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 181 million we have a 92 million allowance for credit losses leaving 89 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses 

  

legal contingencies 

  

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances 

  

income taxes 

  

we record the current year amounts payable or refundable as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 

  

changes in existing laws and rates and their related interpretations and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 

  

other matters 

  

audit services 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp “ey” recently notified the securities and exchange commission “sec” the public company accounting oversight board and the audit committee of our board of directors that certain nonaudit services ey performed in china and japan for a large number of public companies including marriott have raised questions regarding ey’s independence in its performance of audit services 

  

with respect to marriott from 2001 through 2004 ey performed tax calculation and preparation services for marriott employees located in china and japan and affiliates of ey made payment of the relevant taxes on behalf of marriott the payment of those taxes involved handling of companyrelated funds which is not permitted under sec auditor independence rules these actions by affiliates of ey have been discontinued and both the amount of the taxes and the fees paid to ey in connection with these services are de minimis 

  

the audit committee and ey discussed ey’s independence with respect to the company in light of the foregoing facts ey informed the audit committee that it does not believe that the holding and paying of those funds impaired ey’s independence with respect to the company the company based on its own review also is 

  

not aware of any additional nonaudit services that may compromise ey’s independence in performing audit services for the company 

  

inflation 

  

inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we manage our exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives through development and application of credit granting policies and by entering into derivative arrangements we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates or in how such exposure is managed in the future 

  

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floatingrate timeshare and notes receivable our residual interests retained in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals and the fair value of our fixedrate notes receivable 

  

changes in interest rates also impact our floatingrate longterm debt and the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt 

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as a matter of policy we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes

other activities 

  

marriott golf manages 23 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners 

  

we operate 19 systemwide hotel reservation centers 13 of them in the united states and canada and six in other countries and territories that handle reservation requests for marriott lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others 

  

our architecture and construction ac division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from their management or franchise contracts consistent with thirdparty contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriott branded properties on a fee basis 

  

competition 

  

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor there are approximately 600 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

  

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2003 approximately twothirds of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is fairly concentrated with the three largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

  

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

  

based on lodging industry data we have an 8 percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and less than a 1 percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically 

  

generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room revpar than direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference approximately 34 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

  

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness our management lease and franchise agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings we believe that these ongoing refurbishment programs are adequate to preserve the competitive position and earning power of the hotels and timeshare properties we also strive to update and improve the products and services we offer we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising 

  

the vacation ownership industry is one of the fastest growing segments in hospitality and is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies including several branded hotel companies since entering the timeshare industry in 1984 we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide competition in the timeshare business is based primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts the pricing of timeshare intervals and the availability of program benefits such as exchange programs we believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation experiences combined with our financial strength diverse market presence strong brands and wellmaintained properties will enable us to remain competitive 

  

marriott rewards is a frequent guest program with nearly 20 million members and nine participating marriott brands the marriott rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 24 participating airline programs we believe that marriott rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels in addition the ability of marriott vacation club international timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into marriott rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brand 

  

synthetic fuel 

  

our synthetic fuel operation consists of our minority ownership interest in four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities two of which are located at a coal mine in saline county illinois and the remaining two are located at a coal mine in jefferson county alabama the operation creates a fuel that qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section 29 of the internal revenue code this tax credit program expires on december 31 2007 we held all of the ownership in the synthetic fuel business prior to june 21 2003 when we completed a previously announced sale of an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in the operation 

  

at both of the locations the synthetic fuel operation has entered into longterm site leases at sites that are adjacent to large underground mines as well as barge loadout facilities on navigable rivers in addition the synthetic fuel operation has entered into longterm fixedprice coal purchase agreements with the owners of the adjacent coal mines and longterm fixedprice synthetic fuel sales contracts with the tennessee valley authority and with alabama power company two major utilities these contracts ensure that the operation has longterm agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel covering approximately 80 percent of the productive capacity of the facilities from time to time the synthetic fuel operation supplements these base contracts as opportunities arise by entering into shortterm spot contracts to buy coal from other coal mines and sell synthetic fuel to these or different end users the operation is slightly seasonal as the synthetic fuel is mainly burned to produce electricity and electricity use peaks in the summer in the markets served by the synthetic fuel operation 

  

in addition the synthetic fuel operation has entered into a longterm operations and maintenance agreement with an experienced manager of synthetic fuel facilities this manager is responsible for staffing the facilities operating and maintaining the machinery and conducting routine maintenance on behalf of the synthetic fuel operation 

  

finally the synthetic fuel operation has entered into a longterm license and binder supply agreement with headwaters incorporated which permits the operation to utilize a carboxylated polystyrene copolymer emulsion patented by headwaters and manufactured by dow chemical to facilitate converting the coal into a qualified synthetic fuel 

  

on november 7 2003 the us internal revenue service issued private letter rulings to the synthetic fuel joint venture confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the facilities is a “qualified fuel” under section 29 of the internal revenue code and that the resulting tax credit may be allocated among the members of the synthetic fuel joint venture

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

business and overview 

  

we are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2718 hotels and related facilities our operations are grouped into five business segments fullservice lodging selectservice lodging extendedstay lodging timeshare and synthetic fuel in our lodging business we operate develop and franchise under 14 separate brand names in 68 countries we also operate and develop marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names 

  

we earn base incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare business 1 selling timeshare intervals 2 operating the resorts and 3 financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals in addition we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel joint venture 

  

we evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses interest expense and interest income with the exception of our synthetic fuel segment we do not allocate income taxes to our segments as timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains as well as equity income losses from our joint ventures to each of our segments 

  

this historically challenging time in the lodging industry has demonstrated marriott international’s resilience the strength of our business model superior brands strong management team and dedicated associates we are optimistic about a stronger business climate in 2004 and with the final disposition of our senior living and distribution services businesses in 2003 we look forward to operating as a focused lodging and timeshare company for the first time in our 76year history in 2003 we grew productivity at the hotel level leveraging our buying power and systems greater integration of sophisticated scheduling systems reduced hours worked per occupied room by over 10 percent in 2003 over 2000 levels for participating hotels in addition food and supply costs were reduced due to greater participation in our centralized procurement and accounts payable systems by pooling risk among our managed hotel portfolio we continued to purchase insurance at a lower cost than any property could purchase alone 

  

by the end of 2003 we had highspeed internet access available in approximately 1400 hotels far outpacing our competition we also introduced wireless internet access in lobbies meeting rooms and public spaces in over 900 hotels in the us during the year 

  

consolidated results 

  

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended january 2 2004 january 3 2003 and december 28 2001 

  

continuing operations 

  

revenues 

  

 in millions 

  

   

income from continuing operations 

  

  

   

2003 compared to 2002 

  

revenues from continuing operations increased 7 percent to 9 billion in 2003 reflecting revenue from new lodging properties partially offset by lower demand for hotel rooms and consequently lower fees to us 

  

income from continuing operations net of taxes increased 8 percent to 476 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to 194 synthetic fuel operations contributed 96 million in 2003 compared to 74 million in 2002 our lodging financial results declined 5 million to 702 million in 2003 the comparisons from 2002 benefit from the 50 million pretax charge to writedown acquisition goodwill for execustay in 2002 offset by the 44 million pretax gain on the sale of our investment in interval international in 2002 and further benefit from our 2003 receipt of a 36 million insurance settlement for lost management fees associated with the new york marriott world trade center hotel which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

revenues from continuing operations increased 8 percent to 84 billion in 2002 reflecting the sales of our new synthetic fuel operation and revenue from new lodging properties partially offset by a slowdown in the economy and the resulting decline in lodging demand 

  

income from continuing operations net of taxes increased 63 percent to 439 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 66 percent to 174 income from continuing operations reflected 74 million associated with our synthetic fuel operation the results also reflected a 44 million pretax 2002 gain on the sale of our investment in interval international offset by the 50 million pretax 2002 charge to writedown the acquisition goodwill for execustay and the decreased 2002 demand for hotel rooms and executive apartments the comparisons to 2001 include the impact of the 204 million pretax restructuring and other charges that we recorded against continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

operating income 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

operating income increased 17 percent to 377 million in 2003 the favorable comparisons to 2002 include the impact of the 50 million writedown of goodwill recorded in 2002 associated with our execustay business the 2003 receipt of 36 million of insurance proceeds associated with lost management fees resulting from the destruction of the marriott world trade center hotel and lower 2003 operating losses from our synthetic fuel operation in 2003 our synthetic fuel business generated operating losses of 104 million compared to 134 million in 2002 operating income in 2003 was hurt by 53 million of lower incentive fees which resulted from the weak operating environment in domestic lodging 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

operating income decreased 24 percent to 321 million largely as a result of the 50 million writedown of goodwill associated with our execustay business in addition we recorded 134 million of operating losses associated with our synthetic fuel operation which commenced operations in 2002 the comparisons to 2001 are impacted by the 155 million restructuring and other charges recorded against operating income in 2001 and a 40 million reduction in incentive fees resulting from the decline in hotel demand 

  

marriott lodging 

  

we consider lodging revenues and lodging financial results to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability as a lodging company and enable investors to compare the sales and results of our lodging operations to those of other lodging companies 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

lodging which includes our fullservice selectservice extendedstay and timeshare segments reported financial results of 702 million in 2003 compared to 707 million in 2002 and revenues of 8712 million in 2003 a 6 percent increase compared to revenues of 8222 million in 2002 the lodging revenue and financial results include the receipt of a 36 million insurance settlement for lost revenues associated with the new york world trade center hotel our revenues from base management fees totaled 388 million an increase of 2 percent reflecting 3 percent growth in the number of managed rooms and a 19 percent decline in revpar for our north american managed hotels incentive management fees were 109 million a decline of 33 percent reflecting the decline in revpar as well as lower property level house profit house profit margins declined 27 percentage points largely due to lower average room rates higher wages insurance and utility costs and lower telephone profits offset by continued productivity improvements franchise fees totaled 245 million an increase of 6 percent the comparison to 2002 includes the impact of the 50 million pretax writedown of execustay goodwill recorded in 2002 partially offset by a 44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in interval international 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

lodging financial results increased 10 percent to 707 million and revenues increased 6 percent to 8222 million results reflected a 44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in interval international a timeshare exchange company and increased revenue associated with new properties partially offset by lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms our revenues from base management fees totaled 379 million an increase of 2 percent franchise fees totaled 232 million an increase of 5 percent and incentive management fees were 162 million a decline of 20 percent the 50 million writedown of acquisition goodwill associated with our executive housing business execustay reduced lodging results in 2002 the 2002 comparisons are also impacted by 115 million restructuring costs and other charges recorded against lodging results in 2001 

  

lodging development 

  

marriott lodging opened 185 properties totaling over 31000 rooms across its brands in 2003 while 24 hotels approximately 4000 rooms exited the system highlights of the year included 

  

   

   

   

   

at yearend 2003 we had over 300 hotel properties and approximately 50000 rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development we expect to open over 175 hotels and timeshare resorts approximately 25000 to 30000 rooms in 2004 these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside our control see “forwardlooking statements” above and “liquidity and capital resources” below 

  

revpar 

  

we consider revenue per available room revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties we calculate revpar by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues 

  

the following table shows occupancy average daily rate and revpar for each of our comparable principal established brands we have not presented statistics for companyoperated north american fairfield inn and springhill suites properties here or in the comparable information for the prior years presented later in this report because we operate only a small number of properties as both these brands are predominantly franchised and such information would not be meaningful for those brands identified as “nm” in the tables below systemwide 

  

statistics include data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties systemwide international statistics by region are based on comparable worldwide units excluding north america 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

for north american properties except for the ritzcarlton as noted on the previous page the occupancy average daily rate and revpar statistics used throughout this report for the fiscal year ended january 2 2004 include the period from january 4 2003 through january 2 2004 while the statistics for the fiscal year ended january 3 2003 include the period from december 29 2001 through january 3 2003

revpar for fullservice lodging north american systemwide hotels declined 16 percent to 9057 occupancy for these hotels was flat at 671 percent while average room rates declined 16 percent to 13492 revpar for our international systemwide hotels declined 15 percent occupancy declined 1 percentage point while average room rates remained flat at 11214 

  

our international operations increased 9 percent to 102 million reflecting 21 million of gains associated with the sale of our interests in three joint ventures and favorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by an 8 million charge for guarantee fundings related to a hotel in istanbul a 7 million charge to writedown our investment in a joint venture that sold a hotel at a loss in january 2004 and the impact of the war and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars on international travel earlier in the year

international lodging reported an increase in the results of operations reflecting the impact of the increase in travel in asia and the united kingdom the favorable comparison also reflects the restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001

selectservice lodging  which includes the courtyard fairfield inn and springhill suites brands had revenues of 1 billion a 3 percent increase over the prior year and segment results of 99 million compared to 130 million in 2002 the 31 million decrease reflects the impact of a 12 million reduction in base and incentive management fees partially offset by a 3 million increase in franchise fees the results also include 12 million of higher equity losses primarily from our courtyard joint venture formed in 2000 which owns 120 courtyard hotels

extendedstay lodging had revenues of 600 million a decrease of 6 percent and an operating loss of 3 million compared to income of 55 million in 2001 in 2002 we recorded a 50 million charge to writedown the acquisition goodwill for execustay our base and incentive management fees decreased 7 million and our franchise fees increased 5 million the comparisons to 2001 were also impacted by 16 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

in 2002 across our extendedstay lodging segment we added 44 hotels 5400 rooms over 80 percent of the gross room additions were franchised we deflagged three properties 300 rooms and we decreased our execustay brand by 1800 units 

  

   

2003 compared to 2002 

  

the results of our timeshare segment  marriott vacation club international horizons by marriott vacation club international the ritzcarlton club and marriott grand residence club  decreased 19 percent to 149 million while revenues increased 12 percent note sale gains in 2003 were 64 million compared to 60 million in 2002 contract sales increased 16 percent and were strong at timeshare resorts in the caribbean hawaii and south carolina and soft in lake tahoe orlando and williamsburg the comparison to 2002 reflects the 44 million gain in 2002 on the sale of our investment in interval international timeshare revenues of 1279 million and 1147 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively includes interval sales base management fees and cost reimbursements

synthetic fuel 

  

in october 2001 we acquired four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the “facilities” for 46 million in cash the synthetic fuel produced at the facilities through 2007 qualifies for tax credits based on section 29 of the internal revenue code credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007 we began operating these facilities in the first quarter of 2002 operation of the facilities together with the benefit arising from the tax credits has been and we expect will continue to be significantly accretive to our net income our synthetic fuel operation generated net income of 96 million and 74 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 respectively although the facilities produce significant losses these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under section 29 which reduce our income tax expense in fiscal year 2003 our synthetic fuel operation reflected sales of 302 million equity income of 10 million and an operating loss of 104 million resulting in a tax benefit of 245 million including tax credits of 211 million offset by minority interest expense of 55 million 

  

on june 21 2003 we completed the previously announced sale of an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation we received cash and promissory notes totaling 25 million at closing and we are receiving additional profits that we expect will continue over the life of the venture based on the actual amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser we earned 56 million of such additional profits in 2003 certain post closing conditions including our receipt of satisfactory private letter rulings from the internal revenue service were satisfied during the fourth quarter those rulings confirm among other things both that the process used by our synthetic fuel operations produces a “qualified fuel” as required by section 29 of the internal revenue code and the validity of the joint venture ownership structure with the 50 percent purchaser after reviewing the private letter rulings the purchaser informed us in writing that it would not be exercising a onetime “put option” which would potentially have allowed it to return its ownership interest to us if satisfactory rulings had not been obtained prior to december 15 2003 

  

as a result of the put option we continued to consolidate the synthetic fuel operation through november 6 2003 effective november 7 2003 because the put option was voided we account for the synthetic fuel joint venture using the equity method of accounting the 24 million of additional profits we received from the joint venture partner beginning november 7 2003 along with our share of the equity in losses of the synthetic fuel joint venture are reflected in the income statement under equity in 

earningslosses from synthetic fuel the additional profits earned prior to november 7 2003 along with the revenue generated from the previously consolidated synthetic fuel joint venture are included in synthetic fuel revenue in the income statement 

  

we will continue to record the benefit of our share of the tax credits in our financial statements as a reduction of our tax provision going forward we expect net income will continue to benefit from our participation in the joint venture because of the subsequent tax benefits and credits as well as the earnout payments from our venture partner however the ultimate impact will depend on the production levels of the synthetic fuel operation and is directly tied to the amount of coal produced 

  

general administrative and other expenses 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

general administrative and other expenses increased 13 million in 2003 to 523 million reflecting higher litigation expenses related to two continuing and previously disclosed lawsuits partially offset by the impact of the additional week in 2002 our 2002 fiscal year included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2003 the expenses also reflect foreign exchange gains of 7 million compared to losses of 6 million in 2002 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

general administrative and other expenses decreased 145 million in 2002 to 510 million primarily reflecting the following i 2002 items including a 9 million reserve recorded in connection with a lawsuit involving the sale of a hotel previously managed by us 3 million of higher litigation expenses and 9 million of lower expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan ii 2001 items including 155 million of restructuring costs and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 associated with the downturn in the economy and the impact of the september 11 2001 attacks 13 million related to the writedown of two investments in technology partners 29 million of goodwill amortization expense in accordance with fas no 142 we ceased amortizing goodwill in 2002 11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing investments and the reversal of a 10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our hotels  

  

gains and other income 

  

the following table shows our gains and other income for the fiscal years ended january 2 2004 january 3 2003 and december 28 2001 

  

   

interest expense 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

interest expense increased 24 million to 110 million reflecting interest on the mortgage debt assumed in the fourth quarter of 2002 associated with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities and lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer projects under construction primarily related to our timeshare segment in the fourth quarter of 2003 234 million of senior debt was repaid the weighted average interest rate on the repaid debt was 7 percent 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

interest expense decreased 23 million to 86 million reflecting the decrease in borrowing and interest rates partially offset by lower capitalized interest 

  

interest income and income tax 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

interest income increased 7 million 6 percent to 129 million the provision for loan losses for 2003 was 7 million and includes 15 million of reserves for loans deemed uncollectible at six hotels offset by the reversal of 8 million of reserves no longer deemed necessary 

  

income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest generated a tax benefit of 43 million in 2003 compared to a tax provision of 32 million in 2002 the difference is primarily attributable to the impact of our synthetic fuel operation which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of 245 million in 2003 compared to 208 million in 2002 excluding the impact of our synthetic fuel operation our pretax income was lower in 2003 which also contributed to the favorable tax impact 

  

our effective tax rate for discontinued operations increased from 157 percent to 39 percent due to the impact of the taxes in 2002 associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our senior living services business 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

interest income increased 28 million to 122 million before reflecting reserves of 12 million for loans deemed uncollectible at four hotels the increase in interest income was favorably impacted by amounts recognized that were previously deemed uncollectible the comparison to 2001 also reflects a 6 million charge for expected guarantee fundings recorded against interest income in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to approximately 68 percent in 2002 from 361 percent in 2001 primarily due to the impact of our synthetic fuel operation which generated a tax benefit and tax credits of 208 million our effective tax rate for discontinued operations decreased from 354 percent to 157 percent due to the impact of the taxes associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our senior living services business 

  

discontinued operations 

  

senior living services 

  

in december 2001 management approved and committed to a plan to exit the companion living concept of senior living services and sell the related properties within the next 12 months we recorded an impairment charge of 60 million to adjust the carrying value of the properties to their estimated fair value for the year ended december 28 2001 on october 1 2002 we completed the sale of these properties for 62 million which exceeded our previous estimate of fair value by 11 million we included the 11 million gain in discontinued operations for the year ended january 3 2003 

  

in the second quarter of 2002 we sold five senior living communities for 59 million we ceased operating these communities under our previously existing longterm management agreements we accounted for these sales under the full accrual method in accordance with fas no 66 we continue to provide an operating profit guarantee to the buyer and fundings under that guarantee are applied against the initial deferred gain of 6 million as of january 2 2004 the remaining deferred gain was 3 million 

  

on december 17 2002 we sold 12 senior living communities to cnl for approximately 89 million we accounted for the sale under the full accrual method in accordance with fas no 66 and we recorded an aftertax loss of approximately 13 million on december 30 2002 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to sunrise assisted living inc and to sell nine senior living communities to cnl we completed the sales to sunrise and cnl and a related sale of a parcel of land to sunrise in march 2003 for 266 million and recognized a gain net of taxes of 23 million 

  

on december 30 2002 we purchased 14 senior living communities from an unrelated owner for approximately 15 million in cash plus the assumption of 227 million in debt we had previously agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities management approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months as part of that plan on march 31 2003 we acquired all of the subordinated creditenhanced mortgage securities relating to the 14 communities in a transaction in which we issued 46 million of unsecured marriott international inc notes due april 2004 in the 2003 third quarter we sold the 14 communities to cnl for approximately 184 million we provided a 92 million acquisition loan to cnl in connection with the sale sunrise currently operates and will continue to operate the 14 communities under longterm management agreements we recorded a gain net of taxes of 1 million 

  

for the year ended january 3 2003 we had recorded an aftertax charge of 131 million associated with our agreement to sell our senior living management business accordingly we report the operating results of our senior living segment in discontinued operations during the years ended january 2 2004 and january 3 2003 and the remaining assets and liabilities were classified as assets held for sale and liabilities of businesses held for sale respectively on the balance sheet at january 3 2003 

  

distribution services 

  

in the third quarter of 2002 we completed a previously announced strategic review of our distribution services business and decided to exit that business we completed that exit during the fourth quarter of 2002 through a combination of transferring certain facilities closing other facilities and other suitable arrangements in the year ended january 3 2003 we recognized a pretax charge of 65 million in connection with the decision to exit this business the charge includes 1 15 million for payments to third parties to subsidize their assumption of or in some cases to terminate existing distribution or warehouse lease contracts 2 9 million for severance costs 3 10 million related to the adjusting of fixed assets to net realizable values 4 2 million related to inventory losses 5 15 million for losses on equipment leases 6 10 million for losses on warehouse leases and 

  

7 4 million of other associated charges for the year ended january 2 2004 we incurred exit costs net of tax of 2 million primarily related to ongoing compensation costs associated with the wind down we also reversed 2 million net of tax for previously estimated exit costs which we deemed no longer necessary 

  

2001 restructuring costs and other charges 

  

the company experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks in new york and washington and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy this decline resulted in reduced management and franchise fees cancellation of development projects and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans in 2001 we responded by implementing certain companywide costsaving measures although we did not significantly change the scope of our operations as a result of our restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded pretax restructuring costs of 62 million including 1 15 million in severance costs 2 19 million primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess space arising from the reduction in personnel and 3 28 million related to the writeoff of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable we also incurred 142 million of other charges including 1 85 million related to reserves for guarantees and loan losses 2 12 million related to accounts receivable reserves 3 13 million related to the writedown of properties held for sale and 4 32 million related to the impairment of technologyrelated investments and other writeoffs 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we are party to two multicurrency revolving credit agreements that provide for aggregate borrowings of up to 2 billion expiring in 2006 15 billion expiring in july and 500 million expiring in august which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit we entered into the 500 million facility during the third quarter of 2003 replacing a similar facility that would have expired in february 2004 at january 2 2004 we had no loans outstanding under these facilities fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities borrowings under these facilities bear interest at libor plus a spread based on our public debt rating at january 2 2004 our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to approximately 21 billion we consider these resources together with cash we expect to generate from operations adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate or if disruptions in the commercial paper market take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of september 11 2001 we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facilities which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper 

  

cash from operations 

  

cash from operations depreciation expense and amortization expense for the last three fiscal years are presented in the following table 

  

   

while our timeshare business generates strong operating cash flow the timing of both cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing affects annual amounts we include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash the net operating activity from our timeshare business which excludes the portion of net income from our timeshare business as that number is a component of income from continuing operations is shown in the following table 

  

   

in 2002 other cash flows from operating activities of 223 million included an adjustment for 186 million related to the exit of our senior living services and distribution services businesses and an adjustment for 50 million related to the impairment of goodwill of our execustay brand 

  

in 2001 other cash flows from operating activities of 278 million included an adjustment for 248 million related to noncash restructuring and other charges 

  

earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda was 745 million in 2003 551 million in 2002 and 701 million in 2001 we consider ebitda to be an indicator of our operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business however ebitda is a nongaap financial measure and is not an alternative to net income financial results or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

  

the reconciliation of net income to ebitda is as follows 

  

   

reducing net income are losses associated with our synthetic fuel operations of 104 million and 134 million respectively for the years ended january 2 2004 and january 3 2003 also effecting our 2003 net income is equity in earnings from synthetic fuel of 10 million and minority interest expense of 55 million the synthetic fuel operating losses include depreciation expense of 

8 million for both the years ended january 2 2004 and january 3 2003 there was no loss or depreciation expense associated with our synthetic fuel operations for the year ended december 28 2001 since operations did not commence until to 2002 

  

also included in net income above is income from our discontinued senior living services business of 26 million in 2003 and losses of 108 million and 29 million for 2002 and 2001 respectively as well as losses from our discontinued distribution services business of 54 million and 4 million respectively for 2002 and 2001 there were no losses associated with our distribution services business in 2003 included above is depreciation and amortization expense related to our discontinued operations of 37 million and 44 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively there was no depreciation or amortization expense for our discontinued operations in 2003 

  

a substantial portion of both our net income and therefore ebitda is based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales these include lodging base management fees franchise fees and land rent with over 2700 hotels in the marriott system no single property or region is critical to our financial results 

  

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 07 to 1 at january 2 2004 compared to 08 to 1 at january 3 2003 each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover we also have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities should we need additional working capital 

  

in 2003 we sold 281 million of notes receivable originated by our timeshare business we recognized gains on these sales of 64 million in the year ended january 2 2004 our ability to continue to sell these timeshare notes depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the special purpose entities that buy the notes also we might have increased difficulty or be unable to consummate such sales if the underlying quality of the notes receivable we originate were to deteriorate although we do not expect such a deterioration in connection with these timeshare note sales at january 2 2004 we had repurchase obligations of 19 million related to notes receivable we have sold we do not expect to incur material losses in respect of those obligations we retain interests in the notes which are accounted for as residual interests and in the year ended january 2 2004 we received cash flows of 47 million from those retained interests at january 2 2004 the special purpose entities that had purchased notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of 733 million 

  

investing activities cash flows 

  

acquisitions we continually seek opportunities to enter new markets increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions 

  

dispositions property sales generated cash proceeds of 494 million in 2003 729 million in 2002 and 554 million in 2001 proceeds in 2003 are net of a 92 million note receivable and closing costs and other items totaling 25 million in 2003 we closed on the sales of three hotels and 23 senior living communities we continue to operate all of the hotels under longterm operating agreements 

  

capital expenditures and other investments  capital expenditures of 210 million in 2003 292 million in 2002 and 560 million in 2001 included development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and acquisitions of hotel properties over time we have sold certain lodging and senior living properties under development or to be developed while continuing to operate them under longterm agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales if we were unable to do so our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans and minority equity investments 

  

a summary of our other investing outflows is shown in the table below 

  

   

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging segments because 1 we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus hotel property values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale 

  

we have made loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise we have also made loans to the synthetic fuel joint venture partner and to the purchaser of our senior living business loans outstanding excluding timeshare notes totaled 996 million at january 2 2004 944 million at january 3 2003 and 860 million at december 28 2001 unfunded commitments aggregating 80 million were outstanding at january 2 2004 of which we expect to fund 44 million in 2004 and 60 million in total we participate in a program with an unaffiliated lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate thirdparty ownership of hotels that we operate or franchise 

  

cash from financing activities 

  

debt decreased 319 million in 2003 due to the 200 million repayment at maturity of series a debt in november 2003 and the net pay down of 161 million of commercial paper and other debt debt decreased by 945 million in 2002 due to the redemption of 85 percent of the lyons in may 2002 and the pay down of our revolving credit facility offset by the debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of 14 senior living communities in december 2002 

  

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2003 our longterm debt had an average interest rate of 70 percent and an average maturity of approximately 58 years the ratio of fixedrate longterm debt to total longterm debt was 099 as of january 2 2004 at january 2 2004 we had longterm public debt ratings of bbb from standard and poor’s and baa2 from moody’s 

  

we have 500 million available for future offerings under “universal shelf” registration statements we have filed with the sec 

  

in january 2001 we issued through a private placement 300 million of 7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2008 and received net proceeds of 297 million we completed a registered exchange offer for these notes on january 15 2002 

  

on may 8 2001 we issued zerocoupon convertible senior notes due 2021 also known as lyons and received cash proceeds of 405 million on may 9 2002 we redeemed for cash approximately 85 percent of that issue which the lyons holders tendered for mandatory repurchase the remaining lyons are convertible into approximately 09 million shares of our class a common stock and carry a yield to maturity of 075 percent we may redeem the lyons on or after may 8 2004 the holders may also at their option require us to purchase the lyons at their accreted value on may 8 of each of 2004 2011 and 2016 we may choose to pay the purchase price for redemptions or repurchases in cash andor shares of our class a common stock 

  

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january 2 2004 

  

   

the following table summarizes our commitments as of january 2 2004 

  

   

our guarantees listed above include 238 million for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties our guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows andor proceeds from the sale of hotels when we repurchase non performing timeshare loans we either collect the outstanding loan balance in full or foreclose on the asset and subsequently resell it 

  

our guarantees include 387 million related to senior living services lease obligations and lifecare bonds sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds and cnl is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds prior to the sale of the senior living services business at the end of the first quarter of 2003 these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by the company of obligations of consolidated senior living services subsidiaries sunrise and cnl have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds our guarantees also include 47 million of other guarantees associated with the sunrise sale transaction as a result of the settlement with five star discussed in item 3 41 million of these guarantees included above expired subsequent to january 2 2004 

  

our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to 80 million at january 2 2004 we expect to fund 44 million of those commitments within one year and 16 million in one to three years we do not expect to fund the remaining 20 million of commitments which expire as follows 8 million in one to three years and 12 million after five years 

  

as part of the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of our hotels since we are reimbursed by the hotel owners these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow 

  

  

related party transactions 

  

we have equity method investments in entities that own hotels for which we provide management andor franchise services and we receive a fee in addition in some cases we provide loans preferred equity or guarantees to these entities the following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties 

  

income statement data 

  

   

share repurchases we purchased 105 million of our shares in 2003 at an average price of 3607 per share 78 million of our shares in 2002 at an average price of 3252 per share and 61 million of our shares in 2001 at an average price of 3820 per share as of january 2 2004 13 million shares remained available for repurchase under authorizations from our board of directors 

  

dividends in may 2003 our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 7 percent to 0075 per share 

  

other matters 

  

inflation inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses 

  

critical accounting policies certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the united states although a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of an accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact we have listed below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 

  

incentive fees 

  

we recognize incentive fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract in interim periods we recognize as income the incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at that date exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us if we recognized incentive fees only after the underlying fullyear performance thresholds were certain the revenue recognized for each year would be unchanged but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the fourth quarter we recognized incentive fee revenue of 109 million 162 million and 202 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

cost reimbursements 

  

we incur certain reimbursable costs on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 0114 “income statement characterization of reimbursements received for ‘outofpocket’ expenses incurred” we report cost reimbursements from managed properties and franchisees as revenue and we report the costs incurred on behalf of managed properties and franchisees as expenses cost 

  

reimbursements are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin or markup these reimbursed costs relate primarily to payroll costs at domestic properties that we manage but also include costs associated with certain materials and services 

  

our financial statements reflect cost reimbursements of 62 billion in 2003 57 billion in 2002 and 52 billion in 2001 

  

real estate sales 

  

we account for the sales of real estate in accordance with fas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” we reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership we reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by 4 million in 2003 51 million in 2002 and 16 million in 2001 our ongoing ability to achieve sale accounting under fas no 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of the sales transactions to comply with these rules 

  

timeshare sales 

  

we also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in accordance with fas no 66 we recognize sales when 1 we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval 2 the purchaser’s period to cancel for a refund has expired 3 we deem the receivables to be collectible and 4 we have attained certain minimum sales and construction levels we defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria 

  

costs incurred to sell real estate projects 

  

we capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects that are attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until we have recognized the sale costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of fas no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” under this approach we capitalized selling and marketing costs of approximately 69 million and 107 million at january 2 2004 and january 3 2003 respectively and have included those costs in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets if a contract is cancelled we charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record forfeited deposits as income 

  

residual interests 

  

we periodically sell the notes receivable originated by our timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals we retain servicing assets and other interests in the assets transferred to entities that are accounted for as residual interests the residual interests are treated as “trading” or “available for sale” securities under the provisions of fas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities”at the end of each reporting period we estimate the fair value of the residual interests including servicing assets using a discounted cash flow model we report changes in the fair values of these residual interests through the accompanying consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for availableforsale securities we had residual interests of 203 million at january 2 2004 and 135 million at january 3 2003 which are recorded as longterm receivables on the consolidated balance sheet 

  

loan loss reserves 

  

we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral we apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy where we determine that a loan is impaired we recognize interest income on a cash basis at january 2 2004 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 142 million we have a 61 million allowance for credit losses leaving 81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses 

  

marriott rewards 

  

marriott rewards is our frequent guest incentive marketing program marriott rewards members earn points based on their spending at our lodging operations and to a lesser degree through participation in affiliated partners’ programs such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies 

  

we defer revenue received from managed franchised and marriottownedleased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation we determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels 

  

including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed these judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program including marketing promotion and communicating with and performing member services for the marriott rewards members due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the marriott rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed we recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded upon the redemption of points we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed 

  

valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets 

  

we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset we evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections we evaluate the potential impairment of other intangible assets whenever an event or other circumstance indicates that we may be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset our evaluation is based upon future cash flow projections we record an impairment loss for goodwill and other intangible assets when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value

many timesharing resorts are located adjacent to marriott hotels and timeshare owners have access to certain hotel facilities during their vacation owners can trade their annual interval for intervals at other marriott timesharing resorts or for intervals at certain timesharing resorts not otherwise sponsored by marriott through an external exchange company owners also can trade their unused interval for points in the marriott rewards frequent stay program enabling them to stay at over 2300 marriott hotels worldwide

other activities 

  

marriott golf manages 26 golf course facilities as part of our management of hotels and for other golf course owners 

  

we operate 18 systemwide hotel reservation centers 11 of them in the us and canada and seven internationally that handle reservation requests for marriott lodging brands worldwide including franchised properties we own one of the us facilities and lease the others 

  

our architecture and construction division provides design development construction refurbishment and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties and senior living communities on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from their management or franchise contracts consistent with third party contractors ac provides these services for owners and franchisees of marriott branded properties on a fee basis 

  

competition 

  

we encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor there are approximately 600 lodging management companies in the united states including several that operate more than 100 properties these operators are primarily private management firms but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands management contracts are typically longterm in nature but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met 

  

affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the us lodging industry in 2002 over twothirds of us hotel rooms were brandaffiliated most of the branded properties are franchises under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system the franchising business is fairly concentrated with the three largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all us rooms 

  

outside the united states branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators we believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local economies grow trade barriers are reduced international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs 

  

based on lodging industry data we have an eight percent share of the us hotel market based on number of rooms and less than a one percent share of the lodging market outside the united states we believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and revenue per available room revpar than direct competitors in most market areas we attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference approximately 36 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales come from additional purchases by or referrals from existing owners we believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities our marketing programs reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands 

  

  

properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness our management lease and franchise agreements provide for the allocation of funds generally a fixed percentage of revenue for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings we believe that the ongoing refurbishment program is adequate to preserve the competitive position and earning power of the hotels we also strive to update and improve the products and services we offer we believe that by operating a number of hotels among our brands we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains which rely exclusively on franchising 

  

marriott rewards is a frequent guest program with over 18 million members and nine participating marriott brands the marriott rewards program yields repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards or airline miles with any of 22 participating airline programs we believe that marriott rewards generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels 

  

discontinued operations 

  

marriott senior living services 

  

in our senior living services business we operate both “independent fullservice” and “assisted living” senior living communities and provide related senior care services most are rental communities with monthly rates that depend on the amenities and services provided we are one of the largest us operators of senior living communities in the quality tier marriott international entered into a definitive agreement on december 30 2002 to sell our senior living services business to sunrise assisted living inc and our remaining communities to cnl retirement partners inc cnl we expect to complete the sale early in 2003 also on december 30 2002 we purchased 14 senior living communities for approximately 15 million in cash plus the assumption of 227 million in debt from an unrelated owner we plan to restructure the debt and sell the 14 communities in 2003 we now report our senior living services business as discontinued operations see the notes to consolidated financial statements

the assisted living concepts typically include three meals per day linen and housekeeping services security transportation and social and recreational activities additionally skilled nursing and therapy services are generally available to brighton gardens residents 

  

  

terms of the senior living services management agreements vary but typically include base management fees ranging from four to six percent of revenues central administrative services reimbursements and incentive management fees such agreements are generally for initial periods of five to 30 years with options to renew for up to 25 additional years under the leases covering certain of the communities we pay the owner fixed annual rent plus additional rent equal to a percentage of the amount by which annual revenues exceed a fixed amount 

  

marriott distribution services

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of 

operations 

  

general 

  

the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for fiscal years ended january 3 2003 december 28 2001 and december 29 2000 systemwide sales include sales from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties 

  

consolidated results 

  

continuing operations 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

income from continuing operations net of taxes increased 63 percent to 439 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 66 percent to 174 income from continuing operations reflected 208 million of tax benefits associated with our synthetic fuel business and a 44 million gain on the sale of our investment in interval international offset by the 50 million charge to writedown the acquisition goodwill for execustay and the decreased demand for hotels and executive apartments the comparisons to 2001 reflected the 204 million pretax restructuring and other charges against continuing operations that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

sales which exclude sales from our discontinued distribution services and senior living services businesses increased 8 percent to 84 billion in 2002 reflecting the sales for our new synthetic fuel business and revenue from new lodging properties partially offset by the decline in lodging demand systemwide sales excluding sales from discontinued businesses increased by 6 percent to 186 billion in 2002 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 45 percent to 269 million and 46 percent to 105 respectively pretax restructuring and other charges totaling 204 million and lower lodging segment financial results due to the decline in hotel performance reduced income from continuing operations 

  

sales of 78 billion in 2001 from our continuing operations were down slightly compared to the prior year reflecting a decline in hotel performance partially offset by revenue from new lodging properties systemwide sales excluding sales from our discontinued businesses were 175 billion flat with the prior year 

  

marriott lodging 

  

   

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

marriott lodging which includes our fullservice selectservice extendedstay and timeshare segments reported a 10 percent increase in segment financial results and 6 percent higher sales in 2002 results reflect a 44 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in interval international increased revenue associated with new properties partially offset by lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms our revenues from base fees totaled 379 million an increase of 2 percent franchise fees totaled 232 million an increase of 5 percent and incentive management fees were 162 million a decline of 20 percent the 50 million writedown of acquisition goodwill associated with our executive housing business execustay reduced lodging results in 2002 the 2002 comparisons are also impacted by the 115 million restructuring costs and other charges recorded in 2001 

  

  

we consider revenue per available room revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable properties we calculate revpar by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues comparable revpar room rate and occupancy statistics used throughout this report are based on north american properties we operate statistics for fairfield inn and springhill suites companyoperated north american properties are not presented  since these brands only have a few properties that we operate the information would not be meaningful identified as nm in the tables below systemwide statistics include data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased and managed properties systemwide statistics are based on comparable worldwide units reflecting constant foreign exchange rates occupancy average daily rate and revpar for each of our principal established brands are shown in the following table 

  

   

  

across our lodging brands revpar for comparable companyoperated north american properties declined by an average of 57 percent in 2002 average room rates for these hotels decreased 49 percent and occupancy declined slightly to 701 percent 

  

international lodging reported an increase in the results of operations reflecting the impact of the increase in travel in asia and the united kingdom the favorable comparison is also impacted by the restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001 

  

marriott vacation club international financial results increased 24 percent reflecting a 5 percent increase in contract sales and note sale gains in 2002 of 60 million compared to 40 million in 2001 a gain of 44 million related to the sale of our investment in interval international partially offset by lower development profits and higher depreciation from recently added systems for customer support 

  

lodging development 

  

marriott lodging opened 188 properties totaling over 31000 rooms across its brands in 2002 while 25 hotels approximately 4700 rooms exited the system highlights of the year included 

  

   

   

   

   

at yearend 2002 we had 300 hotel properties and more than 50000 rooms under construction awaiting conversion or approved for development we expect to open over 150 hotels and timesharing resorts 25000  30000 rooms in 2003 these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are outside our control see “forwardlooking statements” above and “liquidity and capital resources” below 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

marriott lodging which includes our fullservice selectservice extendedstay and timeshare segments reported a 32 percent decrease in segment financial results and 2 percent lower sales in 2001 results reflected restructuring costs of 44 million and other charges of 71 million including a 36 million reserve for thirdparty guarantees we expect to fund and not recover out of future cash flow 12 million of reserves for accounts receivable deemed uncollectible a writeoff of two investments in management contracts and other assets of 8 million 13 million of losses on the anticipated sale of three lodging properties and a 2 million writeoff associated with capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform results also reflect lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms partially offset by increased revenue associated with new properties incentive management fees declined 36 percent base management fees declined 3 percent and franchise fees increased 6 percent 

  

occupancy average daily rate and revpar for each of our principal established brands are shown in the following table 

  

   

across our lodging brands revpar for comparable companyoperated north american properties declined by an average of 104 percent in 2001 average room rates for these hotels declined 2 percent while occupancy declined 67 percentage points 

  

international lodging reported a decrease in the results of operations reflecting the impact of the decline in international travel and restructuring and other charges partially offset by sales associated with new rooms over 35 percent of rooms added in 2001 were outside the united states 

  

marriott vacation club international contributed over 20 percent of lodging segment financial results in 2001 after the impact of restructuring and other charges segment financial results increased 7 percent reflecting a 

  

  

22 percent increase in contract sales the 2001 acquisition of the grand residence club in lake tahoe california and note sale gains in 2001 of 40 million compared to 22 million in 2000 partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses and severance expenses of nearly 2 million associated with the company’s restructuring plan 

  

corporate expenses interest and taxes 

  

corporate expenses 

  

   

2002 compared to 2001 

  

corporate expenses decreased 31 million in 2002 to 126 million reflecting the following i 2002 items including higher insurance costs higher litigation expenses lower expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan lower foreign exchange losses and the continued favorable impact of our cost containment initiatives ii 2001 items including restructuring charges of 18 million related to severance costs and facilities exit costs a 35 million writeoff of three investments in technology partners including a 22 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter 11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing investments and the reversal of a 10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our hotels 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

corporate expenses increased 37 million reflecting the impact of restructuring charges of 18 million related to severance costs and facilities exit costs and other charges related to the fourth quarter writeoff of a 22 million investment in one of our technology partners in addition to these items we also recorded 8 million of foreign exchange losses and in prior quarters we recorded a 13 million writeoff of two investments in technology partners these charges were partially offset by 11 million in gains from the sale of affordable housing tax credit investments the favorable impact of cost containment action plans and the reversal of a longstanding 10 million insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our managed hotels the reversal of the insurance reserve was the result of our conclusion that a settlement could be reached in an amount that would be covered by insurance we determined that it was no longer probable that the loss contingency would result in a material outlay by us and accordingly we reversed the reserve during the first quarter of 2001 

  

interest expense 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

interest expense decreased 23 million to 86 million reflecting the decrease in borrowing and interest rates 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

interest expense increased 9 million to 109 million reflecting the impact of the issuance of series e notes in january 2001 and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities partially offset by lower interest resulting from the payoff of commercial paper 

  

interest income and income tax 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

interest income increased 28 million before reflecting reserves of 12 million for loans deemed uncollectible at four hotels the increase in interest income was favorably impacted by amounts recognized which were previously 

  

deemed uncollectible the comparison to 2001 also reflects a 6 million charge for expected guarantee fundings recorded against interest income in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to approximately 68 percent in 2002 from 361 percent in 2001 primarily due to the impact of our synthetic fuel business excluding the impact of synthetic fuel our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2002 was 396 percent our effective tax rate for discontinued operations decreased from 354 percent to 157 percent due to the impact of the taxes associated with the sale of stock in connection with the disposal of our senior living services business 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

interest income increased 34 million before reflecting reserves of 48 million for loans deemed uncollectible as a result of certain hotels experiencing significant declines in profitability and the owners not being able to meet debt service obligations the change in interest income was impacted by income associated with higher loan balances including the loans made to the courtyard joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2000 offset by 6 million of expected guarantee fundings and the impact of 14 million of income recorded in 2000 associated with an international loan that was previously deemed uncollectible 

  

our effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 361 percent in 2001 from 366 percent in 2000 as a result of modifications related to our deferred compensation plan and the impact of increased income in countries with lower effective tax rates 

  

synthetic fuel 

  

in october 2001 we acquired four coalbased synthetic fuel production facilities the facilities for 46 million in cash the synthetic fuel produced at the facilities qualifies for tax credits based on section 29 of the internal revenue code under section 29 tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel produced after 2007 we began operating these facilities in the first quarter of 2002 the operation of the facilities together with the benefit arising from the tax credits has been and we expect will continue to be significantly accretive to our net income although the facilities produce significant losses these are more than offset by the tax credits generated under section 29 which reduce our income tax expense in the fiscal year 2002 our synthetic fuel business reflected sales of 193 million and a loss of 134 million resulting in a tax benefit of 49 million and tax credits of 159 million 

  

in january 2003 we entered into a contract with an unrelated third party to sell approximately a 50 percent interest in the synthetic fuel business the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including the receipt of a satisfactory private letter ruling from the internal revenue service regarding the new ownership structure contracts related to the potential sale are being held in escrow until closing conditions are met if the conditions are not met by august 31 2003 neither party will have an obligation to perform under the agreements if the transaction is consummated we expect to receive 25 million in promissory notes and cash as well as an earnout based on the amount of synthetic fuel produced if the transaction is consummated we expect to account for the remaining interest in the synthetic fuel business under the equity method of accounting 

  

discontinued operations 

  

senior living services 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

on december 30 2002 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our senior living management business to sunrise assisted living inc and to sell nine senior living communities to cnl retirement partners inc cnl for approximately 259 million in cash we expect to complete the sale early in 2003 on december 17 2002 we sold twelve senior living communities to cnl for approximately 89 million in cash we accounted for the sale under the full accrual method in accordance with financial accounting standards fas 66 and we recorded an aftertax loss of approximately 13 million also on december 30 2002 we purchased 14 senior living communities for approximately 15 million in cash plus the assumption of 227 million in debt from an unrelated owner we had previously agreed to provide a form of credit enhancement on the outstanding debt related to these communities we plan to restructure the debt and sell the communities in 2003 management has approved and committed to a plan to sell these communities within 12 months accordingly at january 3 2003 the operating results of our senior living services 

  

segment are reported in discontinued operations and the remaining assets are classified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet 

  

as a result of the transactions outlined above we anticipate a total aftertax charge of 109 million since generally accepted accounting principles do not allow gains to be recognized until the underlying transaction closes we cannot record the estimated aftertax gain of 22 million on the sale of the nine communities to cnl until the sale is completed which we expect to occur in early 2003 as a result we have recorded an aftertax charge of 131 million which is included in discontinued operations for the year ended january 3 2003 

  

in december 2001 management approved and committed to a plan to exit the companion living concept of senior living services and sell the related properties within the next 12 months we recorded an impairment charge of 60 million to adjust the carrying value of the properties to their estimated fair value at december 28 2001 on october 1 2002 we completed the sale of these properties for 62 million which exceeded our previous estimate of fair value by 11 million we included the 11 million gain in discontinued operations for the year ended january 3 2003 

  

income from discontinued operations net of taxes and excluding the loss on disposal of 131 million was 23 million an increase of 52 million over 2001 results the increase reflects the impact of the 2001 plan to exit the companion living concept and its subsequent execution higher per diems recognition of a 2 million onetime pretax payment associated with the sale of the crestline senior living communities to an unaffiliated thirdparty lower amortization associated with our adoption of fas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in the first quarter of 2002 and lower depreciation partially offset by higher insurance costs 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

marriott senior living services posted a 9 percent increase in sales in 2001 as we added a net total of three new communities 369 units during the year occupancy for comparable communities increased by nearly 2 percent to 853 percent in 2001 

  

the division reported an after tax loss of 45 million reflecting pretax restructuring and other charges of 62 million primarily related to the 60 million writedown of 25 senior living communities held for sale to their estimated fair value and the writeoff of a 2 million pretax receivable no longer deemed collectible these charges were partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in comparable occupancy and the new units 

  

distribution services 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

in the third quarter of 2002 we completed a previously announced strategic review of the distribution services business and decided to exit the business as of january 3 2003 through a combination of sale and transfer of nine facilities and the termination of all operations at four facilities we have exited the distribution services business accordingly we present the operating results of our distribution services business as discontinued operations and classify the remaining assets as held for sale at january 3 2003 on the balance sheet the after tax cost to exit the business was 40 million and included payments to third parties in connection with contractual agreements severance costs and adjusting fixed assets to net realizable value we present the exit costs together with the loss on operations of 14 million net of taxes in discontinued operations for the year ended january 3 2003 the 14 million after tax loss in 2002 represents a decline of 10 million from 2001 results the decrease reflects the impact of lower sales and a pretax 2 million writeoff in the first quarter of 2002 of an investment in a customer contract offset by the 2001 restructuring and other charges of 5 million pretax for severance costs and the writeoff of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that filed for bankruptcy 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

financial results for marriott distribution services mds reflect the impact of an increase in sales related to the commencement of new contracts in 2001 and increased sales from contracts established in 2000 the impact of higher sales on the financial results was more than offset by the decline in business from one significant customer transportation inefficiencies and restructuring and other charges of 5 million pretax including severance costs and the writeoff of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that filed for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

  

2001 restructuring costs and other charges 

  

the company experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks on new york and washington and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy this decline resulted in reduced management and franchise fees cancellation of development projects and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans in 2001 we responded by implementing certain companywide costsaving measures although we did not significantly change the scope of our operations as a result of our restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded pretax restructuring costs of 62 million including 1 15 million in severance costs 2 19 million primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess space arising from the reduction in personnel and 3 28 million related to the writeoff of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable we also incurred 142 million of other charges including 1 85 million related to reserves for guarantees and loan losses 2 12 million related to accounts receivable reserves 3 13 million related to the writedown of properties held for sale and 4 32 million related to the impairment of technology related investments and other writeoffs we have provided below detailed information related to the restructuring costs and other charges which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the economic downturn and the unfavorable lodging environment 

  

2001 restructuring costs 

  

severance 

  

our restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of approximately 1700 employees across our operations the majority of which were terminated by december 28 2001 in 2001 we recorded a workforce reduction charge of 15 million related primarily to severance and fringe benefits the charge did not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for propertylevel severance costs in addition we delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours 

  

facilities exit costs 

  

as a result of the workforce reduction and delay in filling vacant positions we consolidated excess corporate facilities we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately 14 million for excess corporate facilities primarily related to lease terminations and noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income in addition we recorded a 5 million charge for lease terminations resulting from cancellations of leased units by our corporate apartment business primarily in downtown new york city 

  

development cancellations and elimination of product line 

  

we incur certain costs associated with the development of properties including legal costs the cost of land and planning and design costs we capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the property once it is developed as a result of the dramatic downturn in the economy in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks we decided to cancel development projects that were no longer deemed viable as a result in 2001 we expensed 28 million of previously capitalized costs 

  

2001 other charges 

  

reserves for guarantees and loan losses 

  

we issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with financing transactions and other obligations we also advance loans to some owners of properties that we manage as a result of the downturn in the economy certain hotels experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners were not able to meet debt service obligations to the company or in some cases to other thirdparty lending institutions as a result in 2001 based upon cash flow projections we expected to fund under certain guarantees which were not deemed recoverable and we expected that several of the loans made by us would not be repaid according to their original terms due to these expected nonrecoverable guarantee fundings and expected loan losses we recorded charges of 85 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

  

accounts receivablebad debts 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2001 we reserved 12 million of accounts receivable which we deemed uncollectible following an analysis of these accounts generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment 

  

asset impairments 

  

we recorded a charge related to the impairment of an investment in a technologyrelated joint venture 22 million losses on the anticipated sale of three lodging properties 13 million writeoffs of investments in management contracts and other assets 8 million and the writeoff of capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform 2 million 

  

the following table summarizes our remaining restructuring liability  in millions 

  

   

the remaining liability related to the workforce reduction and fundings under guarantees will be substantially paid by january 2004 the amounts related to the space reduction and resulting lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2012 

  

the following table provides further detail on the 2001 charges 

  

2001 segment financial results impact  in millions 

  

   

  

2001 corporate expenses and interest impact  in millions 

  

   

in addition to the above in 2001 we recorded restructuring charges of 62 million and other charges of 5 million now reflected in our losses from discontinued operations the restructuring liability related to discontinued operations was 3 million as of december 28 2001 and 1 million as of january 3 2003 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we have credit facilities which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit at january 3 2003 our cash balances combined with our available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities amounted to nearly 2 billion we consider these resources together with cash we expect to generate from operations adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements finance our longterm growth plans meet debt service and fulfill other cash requirements including the repayment of 200 million of senior notes due in november 2003 we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans we expect that part of our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to longterm committed credit facilities if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper and may have to rely more on bank borrowings which may carry a higher cost than commercial paper 

  

we have presented a claim with an insurance company for lost management fees from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks at this stage of the claims process we have recognized 1 million in income from insurance proceeds although we expect to realize further proceeds we cannot currently estimate the amounts that may be paid to us 

  

cash from operations 

  

cash from operations was 516 million in 2002 403 million in 2001 and 856 million in 2000 income from continuing operations is stated after depreciation expense of 114 million in 2002 110 million in 2001 and 94 million in 2000 and after amortization expense of 36 million in 2002 68 million in 2001 and 67 million in 2000 while our timesharing business generates strong operating cash flow the timing of cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing affect annual amounts we include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash in 2002 the 63 million net cash outflow from timeshare activity included 102 million in timeshare development the amount spent to build timeshare resorts less the costs of sales 280 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections 60 million of note sale gains a 16 million net reduction in marriott rewards accruals 13 million of financially reportable sales in excess of closed sales and 10 million of other cash outflows offset by 387 million of note sale proceeds and 31 million of net fees received for servicing notes in 2001 the 358 million net cash outflow from timeshare activity included 253 million in timeshare development 320 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections 40 million of note sale gains and 27 million in capitalized marketing costs offset by 199 million of note sale proceeds 26 million of net fees received for servicing notes 53 million of closed sales in excess of financially reportable sales and 4 million of other cash inflows in 2000 the 195 million cash outflow from timeshare activity included 112 million in timeshare development 210 million of new timeshare mortgages net of collections 23 million of note sale gains 25 million in capitalized marketing costs 18 million of financially reportable sales in excess of closed sales and 3 million of other cash outflows offset by 154 million of note sale proceeds 17 million of net fees received for servicing notes and 25 million net increase in marriott rewards accruals 

  

  

in 2002 other cash flows from operating activities of 223 million included an adjustment for 186 million related to the exit of our senior living services and distribution services businesses and an adjustment for 50 million related to the impairment of goodwill of our execustay brand 

  

in 2001 other cash flows from operating activities of 278 million included an adjustment for 248 million related to noncash restructuring and other charges necessary to reconcile net income to cash provided by operations 

  

earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda from continuing operations was 707 million in 2002 708 million in 2001 and 1032 million in 2000 excluding the impact of our synthetic fuel business ebitda would have increased by 125 million or 18 percent to 833 million 

  

the reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes to ebitda is as follows 

  

   

we consider ebitda to be an indicator of our operating performance because it can be used to measure our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business nevertheless you should not consider ebitda an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

  

a substantial portion of our ebitda is based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of sales these include lodging base management fees franchise fees and land rent with almost 2600 hotels in the marriott system no single property or region is critical to our financial results 

  

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 08 to 1 at january 3 2003 compared to 14 to 1 at december 28 2001 each of our businesses minimizes working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover additionally we have significant borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreements 

  

in 2002 we securitized 387 million of notes by selling notes receivable originated by our timeshare business we recognized gains on these sales of 60 million in the year ended january 3 2003 our ability to continue to sell notes to such offbalance sheet entities depends on the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the entities buying the notes also our ability to continue to consummate such securitizations would be impacted if the underlying quality of the notes receivable originated by us were to deteriorate although we do not expect such a deterioration in connection with these securitization transactions at january 3 2003 we had repurchase obligations of 12 million related to previously sold notes receivable although we expect to incur no material losses in respect of those obligations we retain interests in the securitizations which are accounted for as interest only strips and in the year ended january 3 2003 we received cash flows of 28 million arising from those retained interests at january 3 2003 the qualifying special purpose entities that had purchased notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of 682 million 

  

investing activities cash flows 

  

acquisitions we continually seek opportunities to enter new markets increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions 

  

  

dispositions property sales generated proceeds of 729 million in 2002 554 million in 2001 and 742 million in 2000 proceeds in 2002 are net of 36 million of financing and joint venture investments made by us in connection with the sales transactions in 2002 we closed on the sales of 10 hotels and 41 senior living communities over half of which we continue to operate under longterm operating agreements 

  

capital expenditures and other investments capital expenditures of 292 million in 2002 560 million in 2001 and 1095 million in 2000 included development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and acquisitions of hotel properties over time we have sold certain lodging and senior living properties under development or to be developed while continuing to operate them under longterm agreements the ability of thirdparty purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole although we expect to continue to consummate such real estate sales if we were unable to do so our liquidity could decrease and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real estate we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans 

  

we also expect to continue to make other investments in connection with adding units to our lodging business these investments include loans minority equity investments and development of new timeshare resorts in 2002 other investing activities outflows of 7 million included equity investments of 26 million an investment in corporate owned life insurance of 11 million and other net cash outflows of 33 million offset by cash proceeds of 63 million from the sale of our investment in interval international in 2001 other investing outflows of 179 million included equity investments of 33 million an investment in corporate owned life insurance of 97 million and other net cash outflows of 131 million partially offset by the sale of the affordable housing tax credit investments of 82 million in 2000 other investing outflows of 377 million included equity investments of 170 million an investment in corporate owned life insurance of 14 million and other net cash outflows of 193 million 

  

on february 23 2000 we entered into an agreement to resolve litigation involving certain limited partnerships formed in the mid to late 1980s under the agreement we paid 31 million to partners in four limited partnerships and acquired through an unconsolidated joint venture the courtyard joint venture with affiliates of host marriott corporation host marriott substantially all of the limited partners’ interests in two other limited partnerships courtyard by marriott limited partnership cbm i and courtyard by marriott ii limited partnership cbm ii these partnerships own 120 courtyard by marriott hotels the courtyard joint venture was financed with equity contributed in equal shares by us and affiliates of host marriott and approximately 200 million in mezzanine debt provided by us our total investment in the joint venture including mezzanine debt is approximately 300 million 

  

in early 2000 the company estimated the amount of the planned investment in the courtyard joint venture based upon 1 estimated post acquisition cash flows including anticipated changes in the related hotel management agreements to be made contemporaneously with the investment 2 the investee’s new capital structure and 3 estimates of prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates reflected in the market at that time the investment in the courtyard joint venture was consummated late in the fourth quarter of 2000 for purposes of purchase accounting the courtyard joint venture valued its investment in the partnership units based on 1 preacquisition cash flows 2 the preacquisition capital structure and 3 prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates in december 2000 

  

due to a number of factors the equity values used in the purchase accounting for the courtyard joint venture’s investment were different than limited partner unit estimates included in the cbm i and cbm ii purchase offer and consent solicitations the solicitations at a 20 percent discount rate the combined cbm i and cbm ii estimates reflected in the solicitations totaled 254 million in the purchase accounting the corresponding equity value in the courtyard joint venture totaled 372 million the principal differences between these two amounts are attributed to the following 1 the investment was consummated almost one year subsequent to the time the original estimates were prepared 30 million and 2 a lower discount rate 17 percent and capitalization rate reflecting changes in market conditions versus the date at which the estimates in the solicitations were prepared 79 million the company assessed its potential investment and any potential loss on settlement based on postacquisition cash flows the purchase accounting was based on preacquisition cash flows and capital structure as a result the factors giving rise to the differences outlined above did not materially impact the company’s previous assessment of any expense related to litigation the postsettlement equity of the joint venture is considerably lower then the preacquisition equity due to additional indebtedness postacquisition and the impact of changes to the management agreements made contemporaneously with the transaction 

  

  

fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on the overall results of our lodging businesses because 1 we own less than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2 management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits versus hotel sales values and 3 our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale 

  

we have made loans to owners of hotels and senior living communities that we operate or franchise loans outstanding under this program excluding timeshare notes totaled 944 million at january 3 2003 860 million at december 28 2001 and 592 million at december 29 2000 unfunded commitments aggregating 217 million were outstanding at january 3 2003 of which we expect to fund 140 million in 2003 and 156 million in total we participate in a program with an unaffiliated lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate thirdparty ownership of hotels that we operate or franchise 

  

cash from financing activities 

  

debt including convertible debt decreased 945 million in 2002 due to the redemption of 85 percent of the lyons in may 2002 and the pay down of our revolving credit facility offset by the debt assumed as part of the acquisition of the 14 senior living communities in december 2002 debt increased by 799 million in 2001 primarily due to borrowings to finance our capital expenditure and share repurchase programs and to maintain excess cash reserves totaling 645 million in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington 

  

our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working capital at yearend 2002 our longterm debt excluding convertible debt and debt associated with businesses held for sale had an average interest rate of 68 percent and an average maturity of approximately 66 years the ratio of fixed rate longterm debt to total longterm debt was 91 as of january 3 2003 

  

in april 1999 january 2000 and january 2001 we filed “universal shelf” registration statements with the securities and exchange commission in the amounts of 500 million 300 million and 300 million respectively as of january 31 2003 we had offered and sold to the public under these registration statements 300 million of debt securities at 7 78 percent due 2009 and 300 million at 8 18 percent due 2005 leaving a balance of 500 million available for future offerings 

  

in january 2001 we issued through a private placement 300 million of 7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2008 and received net proceeds of 297 million we completed a registered exchange offer for these notes on january 15 2002 

  

we are a party to revolving credit agreements that provide for borrowings of 15 billion expiring in july 2006 and 500 million expiring in february 2004 which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit at january 3 2003 loans of approximately 21 million were outstanding under these facilities fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities borrowings under these facilities bear interest at libor plus a spread based on our public debt rating 

  

on may 8 2001 we issued zerocoupon convertible senior notes due 2021 also known as lyons and received cash proceeds of 405 million on may 9 2002 we redeemed for cash the approximately 85 percent of the lyons that were tendered for mandatory repurchase by the holders the remaining lyons are convertible into approximately 09 million shares of our class a common stock and carry a yield to maturity of 075 percent we may not redeem the lyons prior to may 2004 we may at the option of the holders be required to purchase lyons at their accreted value on may 8 of each of 2004 2011 and 2016 we may choose to pay the purchase price for redemptions or repurchases in cash andor shares of our class a common stock 

  

we determine our debt capacity based on the amount and variability of our cash flows ebitda from continuing operations coverage of gross interest cost was 55 times in 2002 and we met the cash flow requirements under our loan agreements excluding the impact of our synthetic fuel business ebitda coverage of gross interest would have been 65 times at january 3 2003 we had longterm public debt ratings of bbb from standard and poor’s and baa2 from moody’s respectively 

  

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations 

  



  

the totals above exclude recourse minimum lease payments of 341 million associated with the discontinued senior living and distribution services businesses due as follows less than 1 year 40 million 13 years 68 million 45 years 63 million and after 5 years 170 million also excluded are nonrecourse minimum lease payments of 82 million associated with the discontinued senior living services business due as follows less than 1 year 2 million 13 years 12 million 45 years 13 million and after 5 years 55 million excluded from the debt obligation is 155 million associated with the discontinued senior living services business 

  

the following table summarizes our commitments 

  



  

our guarantees include 270 million for commitments which will not be in effect until the underlying hotels are open and we begin to manage the properties our total unfunded loan commitments amounted to 217 million at january 3 2003 we expect to fund 140 million within one year and 16 million in one to three years we do not expect to fund the remaining 61 million of commitments which expire as follows 51 million within one year 5 million in one to three years 2 million in four to five years and 3 million after five years 

  

share repurchases we purchased 78 million of our shares in 2002 at an average price of 3252 per share and 61 million of our shares in 2001 at an average price of 3820 per share as of february 6 2003 we had been authorized by our board of directors to repurchase 20 million shares 

  

dividends in may 2002 our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8 percent to 07 per share 

  

other matters 

  

inflation 

  

inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our businesses 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters our accounting policies are in compliance with principles generally accepted in the united states although a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of an accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact we have listed below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 

  

  

incentive fees 

  

we recognize incentive fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract in interim periods we recognize as income the incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at that date exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us if we recognized incentive fees only after the underlying fullyear performance thresholds were certain the revenue recognized for each year would be unchanged but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the fourth quarter we recognized incentive fee revenue of 162 million 202 million and 316 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

cost reimbursements 

  

for domestic properties that we manage we are responsible to employees for salaries and wages and to subcontractors and other creditors for materials and services we also have the discretionary responsibility to procure and manage the resources in performing our services under these contracts we therefore include these costs and the reimbursement of the costs as part of our expenses and revenues we recorded cost reimbursements excluding senior living services of 57 billion in 2002 and 52 billion in 2001 and 53 billion in 2000 

  

real estate sales 

  

we account for the sales of real estate in accordance with fas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” we reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership we reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by 51 million in 2002 16 million in 2001 and 18 million in 2000 our ongoing ability to achieve sale accounting under fas no 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of the sales transactions to comply with these rules 

  

timeshare sales 

  

we also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in accordance with fas no 66 we recognize sales when we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval the period of cancellation with refund has expired receivables are deemed collectible and certain minimum sales and construction levels have been attained for sales that do not meet these criteria we defer all revenue using the deposit method 

  

costs incurred to sell real estate projects 

  

we capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until the sales are recognized costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of fas no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects” selling and marketing costs capitalized under this approach were approximately 107 million and 126 million at january 3 2003 and december 28 2001 respectively and are included in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets if a contract is canceled unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs are charged to expense and deposits forfeited are recorded as income 

  

interest only strips 

  

we periodically sell notes receivable originated by our timeshare business in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals we retain servicing assets and interests in the assets transferred to special purpose entities that are accounted for as interest only strips the interest only strips are treated as “trading” or “available for sale” securities under the provisions of fas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” we report changes in the fair values of the interest only strips through the accompanying consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for availableforsale securities we had interest only strips of 135 million at january 3 2003 and 87 million at december 28 2001 which are recorded as longterm receivables on the consolidated balance sheet 

  

loan loss reserves 

  

we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral for impaired loans we establish a specific 

  

impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral we apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy for loans that we have determined to be impaired we recognize interest income on a cash basis at january 3 2003 our recorded investment in impaired loans was 129 million we have a 59 million allowance for credit losses leaving 70 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses 

  

marriott rewards 

  

marriott rewards is our frequent guest incentive marketing program marriott rewards members earn points based on their spending at our lodging operations and to a lesser degree through participation in affiliated partners’ programs such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies 

  

we defer revenue received from managed franchised and marriottownedleased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation we determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels including an estimate of the “breakage” for points that will never be redeemed and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed these judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program including marketing promotion and communicating with and performing member services for the marriott rewards members due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue from hotels in connection with the marriott rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed we recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of the points awarded upon the redemption of points we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed 

  

avendra 

  

in january 2001 marriott and hyatt corporation formed a joint venture avendra llc avendra to be an independent professional procurement services company serving the north american hospitality market and related industries six continents hotels inc clubcorp usa inc and fairmont hotels  resorts inc joined avendra in march 2001 we and the other four members contributed our respective procurement businesses to avendra currently our interest in avendra is slightly less than 50 percent 

  

avendra generally does not purchase and resell goods and services instead its customers purchase goods and services directly from avendra’s vendors on terms negotiated by avendra avendra earns revenue through agreements with its vendors which provide that the vendors pay avendra an unrestricted allowance for purchases by its customers our hotel management agreements treat vendorgenerated unrestricted allowances in three separate ways and the requirements of those agreements are reflected in our procurement services agreement with avendra psa 

  

for purchases of goods and services by the majority of marriott’s managed hotels avendra is permitted to retain unrestricted allowances in an amount sufficient only to recover avendra’s properly allocated costs of providing procurement services other management contracts allow avendra to retain vendor allowances and earn a return which is competitive in the industry this amount is capped by the psa lastly for purchases of goods and services by hotels owned by one of marriott’s hotel owners avendra is not permitted to retain any of such unrestricted allowances instead avendra charges a negotiated fee to marriott and marriott in turn charges a negotiated fee to that owner in 2002 we distributed to the hotels that we manage approximately 12 million in unrestricted rebates received from avendra and its predecessor marketplace by marriott if marriott franchised hotels not managed by marriott elect to purchase through avendra they negotiate separately with avendra and are not bound by the terms of the psa for our managed hotels we account for our interest in avendra under the equity method and recognized income of 2 million in 2002 and a loss of 1 million in 2001 after we have recovered our investment in avendra and associated expenses through distributions from avendra or a sale of all or any portion of our equity interest in avendra we will apply any further benefits to offset costs otherwise allocable to marriott branded hotels 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates we manage our exposure to this risk by monitoring available financing alternatives and through development and application of credit granting policies our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december 28 2001 furthermore we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 

  

the following sensitivity analysis displays how changes in interest rates affect our earnings and the fair values of certain instruments we hold 

  

we hold notes receivable that earn interest at variable rates hypothetically an immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would change annual interest income by 5 million and 5 million based on the respective balances of these notes receivable at january 3 2003 and december 28 2001 

  

changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt and longterm fixed rate notes receivable based on the balances outstanding at january 3 2003 and december 28 2001 a hypothetical immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our longterm fixed rate debt by 42 million and 53 million respectively and would change the fair value of longterm fixed rate notes receivable by 20 million and 22 million respectively in each year 

  

although commercial paper is classified as longterm debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis all commercial paper matures within two months of yearend based on the balance of commercial paper outstanding at january 3 2003 a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would change interest expense by 1 million on an annualized basis

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

general

     the following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations
for fiscal years ended december 28 2001 december 29 2000 and december 31
1999 revenue per available room revpar is calculated by dividing room sales
for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period we
consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it
measures the period over period change in room revenues for comparable
properties revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as
revenues comparable revpar room rate and occupancy statistics used throughout
this report are based on us properties operated by us except for fairfield
inn which data also include franchised units systemwide sales and statistics
include data from our franchised properties in addition to our owned leased
and managed properties systemwide statistics are based on comparable worldwide
units and reflect the impact of foreign exchange rates

     consolidated results

     restructuring costs and other charges

     the company has experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms
in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks on new york and washington
and the subsequent dramatic downturn in the economy this decline has resulted
in reduced management and franchise fees cancellation of development projects
and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans we have responded by
implementing certain companywide costsaving measures although we do not
expect significant changes to the scope of our operations as a result of our
restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded pretax
restructuring costs of 124 million including 1 16 million in severance
costs 2 20 million primarily associated with a loss on a sublease of excess
space arising from the reduction in personnel 3 28 million related to the
writeoff of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed
viable and 4 60 million related to the writedown of the village oaks brand
of companionstyle senior living communities which are now classified as held
for sale to their estimated fair value detailed information related to the
restructuring costs and other charges which were recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2001 as a result of the economic downturn and the unfavorable lodging
environment is provided below

     restructuring costs

     severance

     our restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of approximately 1700
employees the majority of which were terminated by december 28 2001 across
our operations we recorded a workforce reduction charge of 16 million related
primarily to severance and fringe benefits the charge does not reflect amounts
billed out separately to owners for propertylevel severance costs in addition
we delayed filling vacant positions and reduced staff hours

     facilities exit costs

     as a result of the workforce reduction and delay in filling vacant
positions we consolidated excess corporate facilities we recorded a
restructuring charge of approximately 15 million for excess corporate
facilities primarily related to lease terminations and noncancelable lease
costs in excess of estimated sublease income in addition we recorded a 5
million charge for lease terminations resulting from cancellations of leased
units by our corporate apartment business primarily in downtown new york city

     development cancellations and elimination of product line

     we incur certain costs associated with the development of properties
including legal costs the cost of land and planning and design costs we
capitalize these costs as incurred and they become part of the cost basis of the
property once it is developed as a result of the dramatic downturn in the
economy in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks we decided to cancel
development projects that were no longer deemed viable as a result we expensed
28 million of previously capitalized costs in addition management has begun
to actively engage in efforts to sell 25 village oaks senior living communities
these communities offer companion living and are significantly different from
our other senior living brands as a result of the plan to exit this line of
business the

                                       13

assets associated with the 25 properties have been reclassified as assets held
for sale and have accordingly been recorded at their estimated fair value
resulting in an impairment charge of 60 million

     other charges

     reserves for guarantees and loan losses

     we issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with
financing transactions and other obligations we also advance loans to some
owners of properties that we manage as a result of the downturn in the economy
certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the
owners have not been able to meet debt service obligations to the company or in
some cases to other thirdparty lending institutions as a result based upon
cash flow projections we expect to fund under certain guarantees which are not
deemed recoverable and we expect that several of the loans made by us will not
be repaid according to their original terms due to the expected guarantee
fundings deemed nonrecoverable and the expected loan losses we recorded
charges of 85 million in the fourth quarter of 2001

     accounts receivable  bad debts

     in the fourth quarter of 2001 we reserved 17 million of accounts
receivable following an analysis of these accounts which we deemed
uncollectible generally as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating
environment

     asset impairments

     the company recorded a charge related to the impairment of an investment in
a technologyrelated joint venture 22 million losses on the anticipated sale
of three lodging properties 13 million writeoffs of investments in
management contracts and other assets 8 million and the writeoff of
capitalized software costs arising from a decision to change a technology
platform 2 million

     2001 compared to 2000

          net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 51 percent to 236
     million and 92 respectively net income was primarily impacted by pretax
     restructuring and other charges totaling 271 million and lower lodging
     operating profits due to the decline in hotel performance

          sales of 10 billion in 2001 were flat compared to last year
     reflecting a decline in hotel performance partially offset by revenue from
     new lodging and distribution services business and contributions from
     established senior living communities systemwide sales increased slightly
     to 20 billion

     2000 compared to 1999

          net income increased 20 percent to 479 million and diluted earnings
     per share advanced 25 percent to 189 profit growth was driven by our
     strong us lodging operations lower systemrelated costs associated with
     the year 2000 and the impact on the 1999 financial results of a 39 million
     pretax charge to reflect a litigation settlement results were also
     impacted by a 15 million onetime writeoff of a contract investment in
     our distribution services segment in the first quarter of 2000

2001 compared to 2000

     marriott lodging which includes our fullservice selectservice
extendedstay and timeshare segments reported a 32 percent decrease in
operating profit and 2 percent lower sales in 2001 results reflected
restructuring costs of 44 million and other charges of 71 million including a
36 million reserve for thirdparty guarantees we expect to fund and not recover
out of future cash flow 12 million of reserves for accounts receivable deemed
uncollectible a writeoff of two investments in management contracts and other
assets of 8 million 13 million of losses on the anticipated sale of three
lodging properties and a 2 million writeoff associated with capitalized
software costs arising from a decision to change a technology platform results
also reflect lower fees due to the decline in demand for hotel rooms partially
offset by increased revenue associated with new properties lodging management
and franchise fee revenue declined 12 percent in 2001 incentive fee revenue
declined 36 percent base fees revenue declined 3 percent and franchise fee
revenue increased 6 percent lodging operating profit in 2001 including
overhead but excluding restructuring costs and other charges was attributable
to base management fees 33 percent of total franchise fees 21 percent and
land rent 3 percent that are based on fixed dollar amounts or percentages of
sales the balance was attributable to our timesharing business 20 percent
and to incentive management fees and other income based on the profits of the
underlying properties 23 percent

     results for international lodging operations were favorable in 2000
despite a decline in the value of the euro against the us dollar reflecting
strong demand in the middle east asia europe and the caribbean region

     marriott vacation club international also posted favorable profit growth in
2000 reporting a 34 percent increase in contract sales the increase in
contract sales reflects interest in our newest brands horizons by marriott
vacation club in orlando florida and the ritzcarlton club resorts in st
thomas us virgin islands and aspen colorado as well as continued strong
demand for our timeshare properties in hawaii aruba and california the profit
growth in 2000 was impacted by a 6 million decline in gains from the sale of
notes receivable arising from lower note sale volume at the end of the year 24
resorts were in active sales 23 resorts were sold out and an additional 13
resorts were under development

2001 compared to 2000

     marriott senior living services posted a 9 percent increase in sales in
2001 as we added a net total of three new communities 369 units during the
year occupancy for comparable communities increased by nearly 2 percent to 853
percent in 2001

     the division reported an operating loss of 45 million reflecting
restructuring and other charges of 62 million primarily related to the 60
million writedown of 25 senior living communities held for sale to their
estimated fair value and the writeoff of a 2 million receivable no longer
deemed collectible these charges were partially offset by the favorable impact
of the increase in comparable occupancy and the new units

2000 compared to 1999

     marriott senior living services posted a 20 percent increase in sales in
2000 reflecting the net addition of nine properties during the year and a 4
percentage point increase in occupancy for comparable communities to 88 percent
despite the increase in sales profitability was impacted by startup
inefficiencies for new properties higher administrative expenses preopening
costs for new communities costs related to debt associated with facilities
developed by unaffiliated third parties and charges associated with our
decision to limit new construction until the market improves resulting in a
loss of 18 million

     senior living services development
     

     due to oversupply conditions in some senior housing markets we decided in
1999 to dramatically slow development of planned communities consequently a
number of projects in the early stages of development were postponed or
canceled additional projects were canceled in 2000

2001 compared to 2000

     operating results for marriott distribution services mds reflect the
impact of an increase in sales related to the commencement of new contracts in
2001 and increased sales from contracts established in 2000 the impact of
higher sales on the operating results was more than offset by the decline in
business from one significant customer transportation inefficiencies and
restructuring and other charges of 5 million including severance costs and the
writeoff of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that filed for
bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company commenced a strategic
review of this business in january 2002

2000 compared to 1999

     marriott distribution services posted a 32 percent increase in sales for
2000 reflecting the commencement of service to three large restaurant chains in
the year operating profit declined 17 million as a result of startup
inefficiencies associated with the new business and a 15 million pretax
writeoff of an investment in a contract with boston chicken inc and its
boston marketcontrolled subsidiaries a major customer that filed for
bankruptcy in october 1998 mcdonalds corporation mcdonalds acquired boston

2001 compared to 2000

     corporate expenses increased 37 million reflecting the impact of
restructuring charges of 18 million related to severance costs and facilities
exit costs and other charges related to the fourth quarter writeoff of a 22
million investment in one of our technology partners in addition to these
items we also recorded 8 million of foreign exchange losses and in prior
quarters we recorded a 13 million writeoff of two investments in technology
partners these charges were partially offset by 11 million in gains from the
sale of affordable housing tax credit investments the favorable impact of cost
containment action plans and the reversal of a longstanding 10 million
insurance reserve related to a lawsuit at one of our managed hotels the
reversal of the insurance reserve was the result of us being approached in the
first quarter by the plaintiffs counsel who indicated that a settlement could
be reached in an amount that would be covered by insurance we determined that
it was no longer probable that the loss contingency would result in a material
outlay by us and accordingly we reversed the reserve during the first quarter
of 2001

page

2000 compared to 1999

     corporate expenses decreased 44 million in 2000 to 120 million primarily
due to a 39 million pretax charge in 1999 associated with a litigation
settlement and systemsrelated costs associated with year 2000 that were
incurred in 1999 offset by costs incurred in 2000 associated with new corporate
systems and a 3 million charge due to a change in our vacation accrual policy

     interest expense

2001 compared to 2000

     interest expense increased 9 million to 109 million reflecting the impact
of the issuance of series e notes in january 2001 and borrowings under our
revolving credit facilities partially offset by lower interest resulting from
the payoff of commercial paper

2000 compared to 1999

interest expense increased 39 million as a result of borrowings to finance
growth outlays and share repurchases

     interest income and income tax

2001 compared to 2000

     interest income increased 34 million before reflecting reserves of 48
million for loans deemed uncollectible as a result of certain hotels
experiencing significant declines in profitability and the owners not being able
to meet debt service obligations the change in interest income was impacted by
income associated with higher loan balances including the loans made to the
courtyard joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2000 offset by 5 million of
expected guarantee fundings and the impact of 14 million of income recorded in
2000 associated with an international loan that was previously deemed
uncollectible

     our effective income tax rate decreased to 362 percent in 2001 from 368
percent in 2000 as a result of modifications related to our deferred
compensation plan and the impact of increased income in countries with lower
effective tax rates

2000 compared to 1999

     interest income increased 23 million primarily due to the collection of
14 million of interest associated with an international loan that was
previously reserved for and increased advances and loan fundings made during
2000

     our effective income tax rate decreased to approximately 368 percent in
2000 from 373 percent in 1999 primarily due to increased income in countries
with lower effective tax rates

     liquidity and capital resources

     we have credit facilities which support our commercial paper program and
letters of credit at december 28 2001 our cash balances combined with our
available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities was nearly 2 billion
we consider these resources together with cash expected to be generated by
operations adequate to meet our shortterm and longterm liquidity
requirements to finance our longterm growth plans and to meet debt service
and other cash requirements we expect that part of our financing and liquidity
needs will continue to be met through commercial paper borrowings and access to
longterm committed credit facilities if the lodging industry recovers more
slowly than we anticipate our ability to obtain commercial paper borrowings at
competitive rates may be impaired

cash from operations

     cash from operations was 400 million in 2001 850 million in 2000 and
711 million in 1999 net income is stated after depreciation expense of 142
million in 2001 123 million in 2000 and 96 million in 1999 and after

amortization expense of 80 million in 2001 72 million in 2000 and 66
million in 1999 while our timesharing business generates strong operating cash
flow annual amounts are affected by the timing of cash outlays for the
acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser
financing we include timeshare interval sales we finance in cash from
operations when we collect cash payments or the notes are sold for cash

     earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and
amortization ebitda decreased to 701 million in 2001 compared to 1052
million in 2000 and 860 million in 1999

     we consider ebitda to be an indicator of our operating performance because
it can be used to measure our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures
and expand our business nevertheless you should not consider ebitda an
alternative to net income operating profit cash flows from operations or any
other operating or liquidity measure prescribed by accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states

     a substantial portion of our ebitda is based on fixed dollar amounts or
percentages of sales these include lodging base management fees franchise fees
and land rent with over 2500 hotels and senior living communities in the
marriott system no single property or region is critical to our financial
results

     our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 12 at december 28
2001 compared to 9 at december 29 2000 each of our businesses minimizes
working capital through cash management strict creditgranting policies
aggressive collection efforts and high inventory turnover

     in 2001 we securitized 199 million of notes by selling notes receivable
originated by our timeshare business to special purpose entities we recognized
gains on these sales of 40 million in the year ended december 28 2001 our
ability to continue to sell notes to such offbalance sheet entities depends on
the continued ability of the capital markets to provide financing to the
entities buying the notes also our ability to continue to consummate such
securitizations would be impacted if the underlying quality of the notes
receivable originated by us were to deteriorate although we do not expect such
a deterioration in connection with these securitization transactions at
december 28 2001 we had repurchase obligations of 46 million related to
previously sold notes receivable although we expect to incur no material losses
in respect of those obligations we retain interests in the securitizations
which are accounted for as interest only strips and in the year ended december
28 2001 we received cash flows of 30 million arising from those retained
interests at december 28 2001 the special purpose entities that had purchased
notes receivable from us had aggregate assets of 499 million

     while our timesharing business generates strong operating cash flow annual
amounts are affected by the timing of cash outlays for the acquisition and
development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing we
include interval sales we finance in cash from operations when we collect cash
payments or when the notes are sold for cash

investing activities cash flows

     acquisitions we continually seek opportunities to enter new markets
increase market share or broaden service offerings through acquisitions

     dispositions asset sales generated proceeds of 554 million in 2001 742
million in 2000 and 436 million in 1999 proceeds in 2001 are net of 109
million of financing and joint venture investments made by us in connection with
the sales transactions in 2001 we closed on the sales of 18 hotels and one
senior living community most of which we continue to operate under longterm
operating agreements

     capital expenditures and other investments capital expenditures of 560
million in 2001 1095 million in 2000 and 929 million in 1999 included
development and construction of new hotels and senior living communities and
acquisitions of hotel properties over time we have sold certain lodging and
senior living properties under development or to be developed while continuing
to operate them under longterm agreements the ability of thirdparty
purchasers to raise the necessary debt and equity capital depends on the
perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent
in the capital markets as a whole although we expect to continue to consummate
such real estate sales if we were unable to do so our liquidity could decrease
and we could have increased exposure to the operating risks of owning real
estate we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the
effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to
execute our announced growth plans

                                       23

     we also expect to continue to make other investments to grow our
businesses including loans minority equity investments and development of new
timeshare resorts in connection with adding units to our lodging business

     on february 23 2000 we entered into an agreement to resolve litigation
involving certain limited partnerships formed in the mid to late 1980s under
the agreement we paid 31 million to partners in four limited partnerships and
acquired through an unconsolidated joint venture the courtyard joint venture
with affiliates of host marriott corporation host marriott substantially all
of the limited partners interests in two other limited partnerships courtyard
by marriott limited partnership cbm i and courtyard by marriott ii limited
partnership cbm ii these partnerships own 120 courtyard by marriott hotels
the courtyard joint venture was financed with equity contributed in equal shares
by us and affiliates of host marriott and approximately 200 million in
mezzanine debt provided by us our total investment in the joint venture
including mezzanine debt is approximately 300 million

     in early 2000 the company estimated the amount of the planned investment
in the courtyard joint venture based upon 1 estimated post acquisition cash
flows including anticipated changes in the related hotel management agreements
to be made contemporaneously with the investment 2 the investees new capital
structure and 3 estimates of prevailing discount rates and capitalization
rates reflected in the market at that time the investment in the courtyard
joint venture was consummated late in the fourth quarter of 2000 for purposes
of purchase accounting the courtyard joint venture valued its investment in the
partnership units based on 1 preacquisition cash flows 2 the
preacquisition capital structure and 3 prevailing discount rates and
capitalization rates in december 2000

     due to a number of factors the equity values used in the purchase
accounting for the courtyard joint ventures investment were different than
limited partner unit estimates included in the cbm i and cbm ii purchase offer
and consent solicitations the solicitations at a 20 percent discount rate
the combined cbm i and cbm ii estimates reflected in the solicitations totaled
254 million in the purchase accounting the corresponding equity value in the
courtyard joint venture totaled 372 million the principal differences between
these two amounts are attributed to the following 1 the investment was
consummated almost one year subsequent to the time the original estimates were
prepared 30 million and 2 a lower discount rate 17 percent and
capitalization rate reflecting changes in market conditions versus the date at
which the estimates in the solicitations were prepared 79 million the
company assessed its potential investment and any potential loss on settlement
based on postacquisition cash flows the purchase accounting was based on
preacquisition cash flows and capital structure as a result the factors
giving rise to the differences outlined above did not materially impact the
companys previous assessment of any expense related to litigation the
postsettlement equity of the joint venture is considerably lower then the
preacquisition equity due to additional indebtedness postacquisition and the
impact of changes to the management agreements made contemporaneously with the
transaction

     fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little
impact on the overall results of our lodging businesses because 1 we own less
than 1 percent of the total number of hotels that we operate or franchise 2
management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and
profits versus hotel sales values and 3 our management agreements generally
do not terminate upon hotel sale

     we have made loans to owners of hotels and senior living communities that
we operate or franchise loans outstanding under this program excluding
timeshare notes totaled 860 million at december 28 2001 592 million at
december 29 2000 and 295 million at december 31 1999 the balance at
december 28 2001 is stated net of the reserve arising from the 43 million
charge discussed in the restructuring costs and other charges note unfunded
commitments aggregating 669 million were outstanding at december 28 2001 of
which 187 million are expected to be funded in 2002 and 334 million are
expected to be funded in total we participate in a program with an unaffiliated
lender in which we may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate thirdparty
ownership of hotels and senior living services communities that we operate or
franchise

     synthetic fuel in october 2001 we acquired four coalbased synthetic fuel
production facilities the facilities for 46 million in cash the synthetic
fuel produced at the facilities qualifies for tax credits based on section 29 of
the internal revenue code under section 29 tax credits are not available for
synthetic fuel produced after 2007 we currently plan to commence operation of
the facilities in 2002 we anticipate that the operation of the facilities
together with the benefit arising from the tax credits will be significantly
accretive to our net income the operations of the facilities are expected to
produce significant operating losses although we anticipate that these will be
offset by the tax credits generated under section 29 which we expect to reduce
our income tax expense we expect that the

                                       24

facilities will be disclosed as a separate segment in our consolidated financial
statements while operating in 2002 through 2007 and at that point we do not
expect to report the facilities as a separate segment as we do not expect it to
be material

cash from financing activities

     longterm debt including convertible debt increased by 799 million in
2001 and 340 million in 2000 primarily due to borrowings to finance our
capital expenditure and share repurchase programs and to maintain excess cash
reserves totaling 645 million in the aftermath of the september 11 2001
terrorist attacks on new york and washington

     our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources
optimizing the mix and maturity of our longterm debt and reducing our working
capital at yearend 2001 our longterm debt excluding convertible debt had
an average interest rate of 52 percent and an average maturity of approximately
52 years the ratio of fixed rate longterm debt to total longterm debt was
 58 as of december 28 2001

     in april 1999 january 2000 and january 2001 we filed universal shelf
registration statements with the securities and exchange commission in the
amounts of 500 million 300 million and 300 million respectively as of
january 31 2002 we had offered and sold to the public under these registration
statements 300 million of debt securities at 7 78  due 2009 and 300
million at 8 18  due 2005 leaving a balance of 500 million available for
future offerings

     in january 2001 we issued through a private placement 300 million of 7
percent senior unsecured notes due 2008 and received net proceeds of 297
million we agreed to make and complete a registered exchange offer for these
notes and completed that exchange offer on january 15 2002

     we are a party to revolving credit agreements that provide for borrowings
of 15 billion expiring in july 2006 and 500 million expiring in february
2004 which support our commercial paper program and letters of credit loans of
923 million were outstanding at december 28 2001 under these facilities the
large balance under these facilities at yearend was due in part to our decision
to draw down funds due to our desire to maintain excess cash reserves in the
aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks such fluctuations in the
availability of the commercial paper market do not affect our liquidity because
of the flexibility provided by our credit facilities borrowings under these
facilities bear interest at libor plus a spread based on our public debt
rating

     in 1999 we called for mandatory redemption of liquid yield option notes
lyons that were issued in 1996 approximately 64 percent of lyons holders
elected to convert their notes to common stock for which we issued 61 million
shares the other 36 percent of lyons holders received cash totaling 120
million which reduced by 34 million common shares the dilutive impact of these
convertible debt securities issued by a predecessor company in 1996 nine
percent of the cash redemption price was reimbursed to us by our predecessor
company sodexho marriott services inc

     on may 8 2001 we issued zerocoupon convertible senior notes due 2021
also known as lyons and received cash proceeds of 405 million the lyons are
convertible into approximately 64 million shares of our class a common stock
and carry a yield to maturity of 075 percent holders of the lyons have the
option to redeem them on may 8 of each of 2002 2004 2011 and 2016 at their
then accreted value we have adequate credit facilities committed to satisfy
this obligation if it occurs in 2002 we may choose to pay the purchase price
for redemptions or repurchases in cash andor shares of our class a common
stock

     we determine our debt capacity based on the amount and variability of our
cash flows ebitda coverage of gross interest cost was 41 times in 2001 and we
met the cash flow requirements under our loan agreements at december 28 2001
we had longterm public debt ratings of bbb and baa2 from standard and poors
and moodys respectively

to repurchase an additional 135 million shares

     dividends in may 2001 our board of directors increased the quarterly cash

     other matters

     inflation

     inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant
impact on our businesses

     critical accounting policies

     certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in
their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters our
accounting policies are in compliance with principles generally accepted in the
united states although a change in the facts and circumstances of the
underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the
accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact we have listed
below those policies which we believe are critical and require the use of
complex judgment in their application

incentive fees

     we recognize base fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms
of the management contract in interim periods we recognize as income the
incentive fees that would be due to us as if the contract were to terminate at
that date exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us if we
recognized incentive fees only after the underlying fullyear performance
thresholds were certain the revenue recognized for each year would be
unchanged but no incentive fees for any year would be recognized until the
fourth quarter we recognized incentive fees revenue of 202 million 316
million and 268 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively


                                       26

other revenues from managed properties

     for properties that we manage we are responsible to employees for salaries
and wages and to subcontractors and other creditors for materials and services
we also have the discretionary responsibility to procure and manage the
resources in performing our services under these contracts we therefore
include these costs and the reimbursement of the costs as part of our expenses
and revenues we recorded other revenues from properties managed by us of 56
billion in both 2001 and 2000 and 52 billion in 1999

real estate sales

     we account for the sales of real estate in accordance with statement of
financial accounting standards fas no 66 accounting for sales of real
estate gains on sales of real estate are reduced by the maximum exposure to
loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership we reduced gains on
sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss by 16 million in 2001 18
million in 2000 and 8 million in 1999 our ongoing ability to achieve sale
accounting under fas no 66 depends on our ability to negotiate the structure of
the sales transactions to comply with these rules

timeshare sales

     we also recognize revenue from the sale of timeshare interests in
accordance with fas no 66 we recognize sales when a minimum of 10 percent of
the purchase price for the timeshare interval has been received the period of
cancellation with refund has expired receivables are deemed collectible and
certain minimum sales and construction levels have been attained for sales that
do not meet these criteria we defer all revenue using the percentage of
completion or the deposit method as applicable

costs incurred to sell real estate projects

     we capitalize direct costs incurred to sell real estate projects
attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until the
sales are recognized costs eligible for capitalization follow the guidelines of
fas no 67 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate
projects selling and marketing costs capitalized under this approach were
approximately 126 million and 95 million at december 28 2001 and december
29 2000 respectively and are included in other assets in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets if a contract is canceled unrecoverable direct
selling and marketing costs are charged to expense and deposits forfeited are
recorded as income

interest only strips

     we periodically sell notes receivable originated by our timeshare business
in connection with the sale of timeshare intervals we retain servicing assets
and interests in the assets transferred to special purpose entities which are
accounted for as interest only strips the interest only strips are treated as
trading or available for sale securities under the provisions of fas no 115
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities we report
changes in the fair values of the interest only strips through the accompanying
consolidated statement of income for trading securities and through the
accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income for
availableforsale securities we had interest only strips of 87 million at
december 28 2001 and 67 million at december 29 2000

loan loss reserves

     we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the
estimated fair value of the collateral for impaired loans we establish a
specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment
in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the
estimated fair value of the collateral we apply our loan impairment policy
individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the
purpose of applying such policy for loans that we have determined to be
impaired we recognize interest income on a cash basis at december 28 2001
our recorded investment in impaired loans was 110 million prior to the fourth
quarter of 2001 our allowance for credit losses was 16 million following the
charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 see the restructuring costs

                                       27

and other charges footnote we have a 59 million allowance for credit losses
leaving 51 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there is no
related allowance for credit losses

relationship with host marriott

     in recognition of the significant changes in the lodging industry over the
last ten years and the age of our agreements with host marriott many provisions
of which predate our 1993 spinoff we and host marriott concluded that we could
mutually enhance the long term strength and growth of both companies by updating
our existing relationship accordingly we are currently negotiating certain
changes to our management agreements for host marriottowned hotels the
modifications under discussion would if made be effective as of the beginning
of our 2002 fiscal year and would remain subject to the consent of various
lenders to the properties and other third parties if made these changes would
among other things

     provide host marriott with additional approval rights over budgets and
     capital expenditures

     extend the effective management agreement termination dates for several
     hotels

     expand the pool of hotels that host marriott could sell with franchise
     agreements to one of our approved franchisees and revise the method of
     determining the number of hotels that may be sold without a management
     agreement or franchise agreement

     lower the incentive management fees payable to us by amounts dependent in
     part on underlying hotel profitability at eight hotels

     reduce certain expenses to the properties and lower host marriotts working
     capital requirements

     confirm that we and our affiliates may earn a profit in addition to what
     we earn through management fees on certain transactions relating to host
     marriottowned properties and establish the specific conditions under
     which we may profit on future transactions and

     terminate our existing right to purchase up to 20 percent of host
     marriotts outstanding common stock upon certain changes of control and
     clarify our rights in each of our management agreements to prevent either a
     sale of the hotel to our major competitors or specified changes in control
     of host marriott involving our major competitors

we cannot assure you that these negotiations will be successful that the
changes will be substantially as we have described above or that the consents
necessary to implement these changes will be obtained the monetary effect of
the anticipated changes will depend on future events such as the operating
results of the hotels we do not expect these modifications to have a material
financial impact on us

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates we manage our
exposure to this risk by monitoring available financing alternatives and through
development and application of credit granting policies our strategy to manage
exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december 29 2000
furthermore we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates or in how such exposure is managed in the near
future

     the following sensitivity analysis displays how changes in interest rates
affect our earnings and the fair values of certain instruments we hold

     we hold notes receivable that earn interest at variable rates
hypothetically an immediate 1 percentage point change in interest rates would
change annual interest income by 5 million and 3 million based on the
respective balances of these notes receivable at december 28 2001 and december
29 2000

     changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of our longterm fixed
rate debt and longterm fixed rate notes receivable based on the balances
outstanding at december 28 2001 and december 29 2000 a hypothetical immediate
1 percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our
longterm fixed rate debt by 53 million and 50 million respectively and
would change the fair value of longterm fixed rate notes receivable by 22
million in each year
