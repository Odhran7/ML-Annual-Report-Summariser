information about executive officers of the company 

set forth below are the names ages positions and certain other information concerning the executive officers of the company as of february 15 2022 








 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial also may impact its business operations if any of the following risks occur the company’s business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

risks related to covid19 

the company faces risks related to the covid19 pandemic that could adversely affect its business and financial performance 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt global automotive industry production volumes and consumer purchases of light vehicles in 2020 global vehicle production decreased and some vehicle manufacturers at times completely shut down manufacturing operations in some countries and regions including the united states and europe as a result the company has experienced and may continue to experience delays in the production and distribution of its products and the loss of sales if the global economic effects caused by covid19 continue or increase overall customer demand may decrease which could further adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

throughout 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021 global government directives and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions closing of borders stayathome orders plant shutdowns and lockdowns of cities and countries materially impacted the company’s operations furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth traditional functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

during 2021 trailing impacts of the shutdowns and production declines related in part to covid19 created supply constraints of certain components particularly semiconductor chips these supply constraints have had and are expected to continue to have significant impacts on global industry production levels due to the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery at this time the company is unable to predict the extent to which covid19 including its existing and future variants that may emerge may have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows the extent of the impact of covid19 on the company’s operational and financial performance including its ability to execute its business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frames will depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and spread of 

covid19 including variants its severity covid19 containment and treatment efforts including the availability efficacy and acceptance of the vaccines and any related restrictions on travel furthermore the duration timing and severity of the impact on customer production including any recession resulting from covid19 are uncertain and unpredictable an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of covid19 would have a further material negative impact on the company’s business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition although the full extent and duration are uncertain 

risks related to the company’s strategy 

the company’s charging forward strategy may prove unsuccessful 

in 2021 the company announced its strategy to aggressively grow its electrification portfolio over time through organic investments and technologyfocused acquisitions most recently through the 2021 acquisition of akasol as well as the 2020 purchase of delphi technologies the company believes it is well positioned for the industry’s anticipated migration to electric vehicles outlined in this strategy is a target to dispose of 3 to 4 billion in annual revenue from the company’s combustion portfolio by 2025 with approximately 1 billion of that target to be delivered by the end of 2022 the company is targeting revenue from products for pure electric vehicles to be over 25 of its total revenue by 2025 and approximately 45 of its total revenue by 2030 

the company may not meet its goals due to many factors including any of the risks identified in the paragraph that follows failure to develop new products that its customers will purchase and technology changes that could render its products obsolete or the introduction of new technology to which it does not have access among other things additionally there is no certainty that the company will be able to dispose of certain internal combustion assets on favorable terms if at all and the disposition process is expected to consume significant management resources 

the company expects to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage its technology capabilities and enhance its customer base geographic representation and scale to complement its current businesses the company regularly evaluates potential growth opportunities some of which could be material while it believes that such transactions are an integral part of its longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information the company can obtain about a potential growth opportunity can be limited and it can give no assurance that past or future business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect its financial performance or will perform as planned assessing a price for potential transactions is inexact particularly in a market that generally favors sellers and attaches a high multiple or premium on technology the company may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that it has acquired or will acquire in the future including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures failure to execute the company’s growth strategy could adversely affect its business 

the failure to realize the expected benefits of acquisitions and other risks associated with acquisitions could adversely affect the company’s business 

the success of the company’s acquisitions is dependent in part on its ability to realize the expected benefits from combining the businesses of the company and businesses that it acquires to realize these anticipated benefits both companies must be successfully combined which is subject to the company’s ability to consolidate operations corporate cultures and systems and to eliminate redundancies and costs if the company is unsuccessful in combining companies the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected further there is potential for unknown or inestimable liabilities relating to the acquired businesses in addition the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

the combination of independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process that requires significant management attention and resources it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of the company’s operations the inability to maintain or increase its competitive presence inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters andor difficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate cultures any or all of these factors could adversely affect the company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could have an adverse effect on the combined company in addition many of these factors are outside of the company’s control and any one of these factors could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and additional diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially adversely impact its business financial condition and results of operations 

the company may not be able to execute dispositions of assets or businesses successfully 

when the company decides to dispose of assets or a business it may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the ability of the company to achieve its strategic objectives it may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than it had anticipated buyers of the assets or business may from time to time agree to indemnify the company for operations of such businesses after the closing the company cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect it and as a result may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations in addition the company may experience fewer synergies than expected and the impact of the disposition on its financial results may be larger than projected 

after reaching an agreement for the disposition of a business the company is subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent it from completing the transaction such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in jurisdictions around the world and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay or prevent the transaction 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which are subject to periodic impairment evaluations represent a significant portion of the company’s total assets an impairment charge on these assets could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations 

the company has recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets related to acquisitions it periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or macroeconomic trends disruptions to its business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses 

unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets dispositions and market capitalization declines may impair these assets and any of these factors may be increasingly present during the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the company reviews goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment either annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the risk of impairment to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is higher during the early years following an acquisition this is because the fair values of these assets align very closely with what was paid to acquire the reporting units to which these assets are assigned as a result the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value typically referred to as “headroom” is smaller at the time of acquisition until this headroom grows over time due to business growth or lower carrying value of the reporting unit a relatively small decrease in reporting unit fair value can trigger impairment charges when impairment charges are triggered they tend to be material due to the size of the assets involved future acquisitions could present similar risks any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the company’s results of operations in the periods recognized 

risks related to the company’s industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on the company’s sales to oems 

the company faces strong competition 

the company competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition the company’s competitors include vertically integrated units of its major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers additionally its competitors include startups that may be well funded with the result that they could have more operational and financial flexibility than it has a number of the company’s competitors are larger than it is and some competitors have greater financial and other resources than it does although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with the company’s products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products the company currently supplies the company’s traditional oem customers faced with intense international competition have continued to expand their worldwide sourcing of components as a result the company has experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect the company’s business in addition any of its competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than it does develop products that are superior to its products produce similar products at a cost that is lower than its cost or adapt more quickly than it does to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result the company’s products may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors products and it may not be able to meet the growing demands of customers these trends may adversely affect the company’s sales as well as the profit margins on its products 

if the company does not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry could adversely affect its business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of hybrid and electric vehicles and of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially viable fully automated driving experience there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ride sharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a longterm reduction in the number of vehicles per capita in addition some industry participants are exploring transportation through alternatives to automobiles these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if the company does not continue to innovate and develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on its results of operations 

risks related to the company’s business 

the company is under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of its products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products the company supplies oem customers expect annual price reductions in its business to maintain its profit margins the company seeks price reductions from its suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency and streamlined product designs to reduce costs and it attempts to develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices the company’s ability to pass through increased raw material costs to its oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on its business 

the company continues to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of its products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including aluminum copper nickel plastic resins steel other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on its results the company has sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in its customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any increases in the cost of materials the discontinuation or lessening of the company’s ability to pass through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect its business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly if this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect the company’s business 

changes in us administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations may have an adverse effect on the company 

the united states has maintained tariffs on certain imported steel aluminum and items originating from china these tariffs have increased the cost of raw materials and components the company purchases the imposition of tariffs by the united states has resulted in retaliatory tariffs from a number of countries including china which increase the cost of products the company sells if the us or other countries impose additional tariffs that will have a further adverse impact on its business 

the company uses important intellectual property in its business if it is unable to protect its intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against it or its customers relating to intellectual property rights the company’s business could be adversely affected 

the company owns important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements its intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position in a number of the markets that it serves the company’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to its proprietary technologies or design around the patents it owns or licenses further as it expands its operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating the company’s proprietary technologies increases despite efforts it undertakes to protect them the company’s inability to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights or claims that it is infringing intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect its business and its competitive position 

the company is subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of its information technology it systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company has regionally centralized the information systems that support its business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect its business 

a failure of or disruption in the company’s information technology infrastructure including a disruption related to cybersecurity could adversely impact its business and operations 

the company relies on the capacity reliability and security of its it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyberattacks or failures in thirdparty provided services disruptions and attacks on the company’s it systems pose a risk to the security of its systems and its ability to protect its networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of information and data and that of third parties including its employees some cyberattacks depend on human error or manipulation including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or carry out disbursement of funds or other frauds which raise the risks from such events and the costs associated with protecting against such attacks although it has implemented security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of its systems and information and disruptions of its operations the company has been and likely will continue to be subjected to such attacks or disruptions future attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including the company’s intellectual property improper use of its systems and networks access to and manipulation and destruction of company or thirdparty data production downtimes lost revenues inappropriate disbursement of funds and both internal and external supply shortages in addition the company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by such attacks or disruptions in the future these consequences could cause significant damage to the company’s reputation affect its relationships with its customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect its business 

the company’s business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

the company’s ability to sustain and grow its business requires it to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide in particular any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees and employees with engineering technical and software capabilities in numbers sufficient for its needs could adversely affect its business 

the company’s profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties 

the launch of new business is a complex process the success of which depends on a wide range of factors including the production readiness of the company’s manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers as well as factors related to tooling equipment employees initial product quality and other factors the company’s failure to successfully launch new business or its inability to accurately estimate the cost to design develop and launch new business could have an adverse effect on its profitability and results of operations 

to the extent the company is not able to successfully launch new business vehicle production at its customers could be significantly delayed or shut down such situations could result in significant financial penalties to the company or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives and could result in its customers shifting work away from it to a competitor all of which could result in loss of revenue or loss of market share and could have an adverse effect on its profitability and cash flows 

part of the company’s workforce is unionized which could subject it to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 13 of the company’s us workforce was unionized the company has a domestic collective bargaining agreement for one facility in new york which expires in september 2024 the workforce at certain of its international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with its employees could have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

work stoppages production shutdowns and similar events could significantly disrupt the company’s business 

because the automotive industry relies heavily on justintime delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles a work stoppage or production shutdown at one or more of the company’s manufacturing and assembly facilities could have adverse effects on its business similarly if one or more of its customers were to experience a work stoppage or production shutdown that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of the company’s products which could result in the shutdown of the related manufacturing facilities a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to supply constraints such as the constraints experienced in 2021 related to semiconductor chips or due to a work stoppage or production shutdown at one of the company’s suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences and accordingly have an adverse effect on its financial results 

changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase the company’s pension funding obligations and reduce its profitability 

  

the company has unfunded obligations under certain of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the valuation of its future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets is subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline such declines could also require the company to make significant additional contributions to its pension plans in the future additionally a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase the company’s pension expenses and reduce profitability in the future 

the company also sponsors postemployment medical benefit plans in the us that are unfunded if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified this could have an adverse effect on its business 

  

the company is subject to extensive environmental regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation management transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and the company cannot assure that it will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years the company has acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and it cannot assure that it will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate its ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with evolving interpretations of existing environmental health and safety laws and regulations or any new such laws and regulations including concerns about global climate change and its impact that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

the company has liabilities related to environmental product warranties litigation and other claims 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws and as such may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at such sites while responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at such sites is typically shared among potentially responsible parties based on an allocation formula the company could have greater liability under applicable statutes refer to note 21 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

the company provides product warranties to its customers for some of its products under these product warranties the company may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions auto manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product warranty claims a recall claim brought against the company or a product warranty claim brought against it could adversely impact its results of operations in addition a recall claim could require it to review its entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines which could result in significant disruption to its business and could have an adverse impact on its results of operations the company cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in its financial statements 

the company is currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with the company’s customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on the company’s business that is greater than it anticipates while the company maintains insurance for certain risks the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect the company’s business 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results 

the company has operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which it operates compliancerelated issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws could adversely affect its business the company has internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such laws however there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect it from the improper acts of employees agents business partners joint venture partners or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties sanctions andor fines that could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and reputation 

changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where the company operates or intends to operate 

changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect the company’s business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the inability to fully utilize its tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect the company’s operating results in addition the company may periodically restructure its legal entity organization 

if taxing authorities were to disagree with the company’s tax positions in connection with any such restructurings its effective tax rate could be materially affected the company’s tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where it conducts business the company has received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and is currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts the company believes these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

there could be significant liability if the previous delphi technologies separation from its former parent fails to qualify as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes 

on december 4 2017 delphi technologies became an independent publicly traded company following its separation from aptiv plc formerly known as delphi automotive plc the separation was completed in the form of a prorata distribution of 100 of delphi technologies ordinary shares to aptiv’s shareholders aptiv received an opinion from its tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution qualified as a distribution under section 355a of the internal revenue code subject to certain qualifications and limitations based on this tax treatment for us federal income tax purposes except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional delphi technologies ordinary share aptiv shareholders did not recognize a gain or loss or include any amount in their income upon the receipt of delphi technologies ordinary shares in the distribution the opinion was based on and relied on among other things certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from aptiv and delphi technologies including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied aptiv may not be able to rely on the opinion 

and aptiv’s shareholders could be subject to significant us federal income tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the internal revenue service could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable to aptiv’s shareholders if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion 

in addition aptiv expects that restructuring transactions that it undertook in connection with the distribution will be taxed in a certain manner if contrary to aptiv’s expectations such transactions are taxed in a different manner aptiv andor delphi technologies may incur additional tax liabilities that may be substantial if the company is required to pay any such liabilities the payments could materially adversely affect the company’s financial position 

as a result of the acquisition of delphi technologies the company is required to indemnify aptiv against taxes that aptiv incurs that arise as a result of the company taking or failing to take as the case may be certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a distribution under section 355a of the code or that result in certain restructuring transactions in connection with the distribution failing to meet the requirements for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes 

the company is subject to risks related to its international operations 

the company has manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe asia and the americas for 2021 approximately 83 of its consolidated net sales were outside the us consequently the company’s results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes international terrorism and other factors that may be discrete to a particular country or geography compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the periodend exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues expenses and capital expenditures the local currency is typically the functional currency for the companys foreign subsidiaries significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect the company’s business additionally significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro korean won and chinese renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of the company’s businesses’ operations that could negatively affect its results of operations 

because the company is a us holding company one significant source of its funds is distributions from its nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which the company operates have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit the company’s local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject the company to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

the company’s business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic political and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of the company’s global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the chinese market evolves the company anticipates that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and its inability to gain or hold market share in addition the company’s business in china is sensitive to economic 

political social and market conditions that drive sales volumes in china economic growth has slowed in china if it is unable to maintain its position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease the company’s business and financial results could be adversely affected 

a downgrade in the ratings of the company’s debt could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to the company’s debt may ultimately impact its access to the debt capital markets and the costs it incurs to borrow funds if ratings for its debt fall below investment grade the company’s access to the debt capital markets could become restricted and its cost of borrowing or the interest rate for any subsequently issued debt would likely increase 

the company’s revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for its debt are downgraded the interest costs on its revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in its credit agreement further an increase in the level of its indebtedness and related interest costs may increase the company’s vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect its ability to obtain additional financing 

the company could incur additional restructuring charges as it continues to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and to optimize its product portfolio and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions 

the company has initiated and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve the competitiveness of its business and sustain its margin profile optimize its product portfolio or create an optimal legal entity structure the company may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods it expects it is also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with its actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from its actions could have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

risks related to the company’s customers 

the company relies on sales to major customers 

the company relies on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company the company bases its growth projections in part on commitments made by its customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle among other things the level of production orders the company receives is dependent on the ability of its oem customers to design and sell products that consumers desire to purchase if actual production orders from its customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders a customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect the company’s business 

some of the company’s sales are concentrated the company’s worldwide sales in 2021 to ford and volkswagen constituted approximately 10 and 9 of its 2021 consolidated net sales respectively 

the company is sensitive to the effects of its major customers’ labor relations 

all three of the company’s primary north american customers ford stellantis and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems’ dependence on a single union the company is affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems’ facilities similarly a majority of the company’s global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage at one or more of its customers could have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

risks related to the company’s suppliers 

the company could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from its suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services the company has been rationalizing its supply base as a result it remains dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of its products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition the company expects that they will deliver to the company’s stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations industry shortages labor or social unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage cyberattacks nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god” or other problems that the company’s suppliers experience will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to it during 2021 trailing impacts of the shutdowns and production declines related in part to covid19 created supply constraints of certain components particularly semiconductor chips these supply constraints have had and are expected to continue to have significant impacts on global industry production levels if the company is to experience a prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers and cannot procure the components from other sources it may be unable to meet the production schedules for some of its key products and could miss customer delivery expectations in addition with fewer sources of supply for certain components each supplier may perceive that it has greater leverage and therefore some ability to seek higher prices from the company at a time that it faces substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of its products this could adversely affect the company’s customer relations and business 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of the company’s operations and could adversely affect its business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes the company’s need to seek price reductions from its suppliers as a result of the substantial pressure it faces from oems to reduce the prices of its products credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity tariffs transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect the company’s supply chain and sometimes with little advance notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for the company to change suppliers that are critical to its business on occasion the company must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect its supply lines the company cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on its business 

the company is subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts 

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the company’s business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect the company’s business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of the company’s major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs low levels of utilization of the company’s manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products the company supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of fire flood or other natural disasters including pandemics and quarantines

covid19 pandemic and other supply disruptions 

throughout 2020 covid19 materially impacted the company’s business and results of operations following the declaration of covid19 as a global pandemic on march 11 2020 government authorities around the world began to impose shelterinplace orders and other restrictions as a result many oems began suspending manufacturing operations particularly in north america and europe this led to various temporary closures of or reduced operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities late in the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter of 2020 during the second half of 2020 as global management of covid19 evolved and government restrictions were removed or lessened production levels improved and substantially all of the company’s production facilities resumed closer to normal operations by the end of the third quarter of 2020 

during 2021 trailing impacts of the shutdowns and production declines related in part to covid19 created supply constraints of certain components particularly semiconductor chips these supply constraints have had and are expected to continue to have significant impacts on global industry production levels in addition it is possible a resurgence of covid19 could result in adverse impacts in the future management cannot reasonably estimate the full impact the ongoing supply constraints or the covid19 pandemic could have on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the future

the company maintains a positive longterm outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic investments to enhance its product leadership strategy there are several trends that are driving the company’s longterm growth that management expects to continue including adoption of product offerings for electrified vehicles and increasingly stringent global emissions standards that support demand for the company’s products driving vehicle efficiency

pension and other postretirement employee benefits 

the company’s policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate at december 31 2021 all legal funding requirements had been met the company contributed 24 million 174 million and 26 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively on october 1 2020 as a result of the acquisition of delphi technologies the company assumed all of the retirementrelated liabilities of delphi technologies the most significant of which was the delphi technologies pension scheme the “scheme” in the united kingdom on december 12 2020 the company entered into a heads of terms agreement the “agreement” with the trustees of the scheme related to the future funding of the scheme under the agreement the company eliminated the prior schedule of contributions between delphi technologies and the scheme in exchange for a 137 million £100 million onetime contribution into the scheme plan by december 31 2020 which was paid on december 15 2020 the agreement also contained other provisions regarding the implementation of a revised asset investment strategy as well as a funding progress test that will be performed every three years to determine if additional contributions need to be made into the scheme by the company at this time the company anticipates that no additional contributions will need to be made into the scheme until 2026 at the earliest 

the company expects to contribute a total of 20 million to 30 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2022 of the 20 million to 30 million in projected 2022 contributions 7 million are contractually obligated while any remaining payments would be discretionary 

the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of 184 million and 501 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in the net unfunded position was a result of a lower projected benefit obligation which is primarily due to actuarial gains during the period the main driver of these gains was the increase of 053 in the weighted average discount rate for nonus plans of the total net unfunded amounts 89 million and 139 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively were related to plans in germany where there is no tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due additionally 186 million of the net unfunded position at december 31 2020 related to the acquired delphi technologies pension scheme in the united kingdom which reflects the impact of the 137 million contribution discussed above 

other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the company’s us operations the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of 54 million and 65 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the company’s management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows an adverse outcome could nonetheless be material to the results of operations or cash flows 

the company previously disclosed a warranty claim that an oem customer asserted the claim was related to certain combustionrelated products and the company and the customer continued to work through the warranty process in the fourth quarter of 2021 in december 2021 as a result of discussions that occurred in the fourth quarter the company without any admission of liability and the customer reached an agreement to fully resolve the claim for 130 million which the company paid in 2021 for the year ended december 31 2021 the company recorded cumulative charges of 124 million in connection with the warranty claim the company is pursuing a partial recovery of this claim through its insurance coverage however there is no assurance that there will be any recovery 

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 26 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

refer to note 21 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company’s environmental liability 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the company’s most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

business combinations the company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisers for the values and lives of property identifiable intangibles and inventories and actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition if goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit the company utilizes a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred 

acquired intangible assets include customer relationships developed technology and trade names the company estimates the fair value of acquired intangible assets using various valuation techniques the primary valuation techniques used include forms of the income approach specifically the relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings valuation methods under these valuation approaches the company is required to make estimates and assumptions from a market participant perspective which may include revenue growth rates estimated earnings royalty rates obsolescence factors contributory asset charges customer attrition and discount rates under the multiperiod excess earnings method value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets that are necessary to realize those benefits the intangible asset’s estimated earnings are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying estimated earnings from contributory assets 

the company estimates the fair value of trade names and developed technology using the relief from royalty method which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings 

while the company uses its best estimates and assumptions fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date the company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings 

future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future an increase in discount rates a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead 

to a reduction in the estimated fair values which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect the company’s financial statements in any given year 

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under asc topic 360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of longlived assets include changes in the industries in which the company operates particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy as well as competition and advances in technology adverse changes in the regulatory environment or other factors leading to reduction in expected longterm sales or profitability 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon consideration of other factors including recent acquisition restructuring or disposal activity or to refresh the fair values the company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

similar to goodwill the company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trade names using a qualitative analysis considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion in order to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values if the company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles using the relieffromroyalty method which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relieffromroyalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company performed an analysis on each reporting unit given the macroeconomic environment the company performed quantitative goodwill impairment analyses for the majority of reporting units to refresh their respective fair values this requires the company to make 

significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the company’s annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a fiveyear projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments because the projections are estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the company’s facts and circumstances 

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the company’s 2021 goodwill quantitative impairment review are as follows 

• discount rates the company used a range of 124 to 136 weighted average cost of capital “wacc” as the discount rates for future cash flows the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant 

• operating income margin the company used historical and expected operating income margins which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated 

• revenue growth rate the company used a global automotive market industry growth rate forecast adjusted to estimate its own market participation for product lines 

in addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models 

• the automotive industry is cyclical and the company’s results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns 

• the automotive industry is evolving and if the company does not respond appropriately its results of operations would be adversely affected 

• the company is dependent on market segments that use its key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments 

• the company is subject to risks related to international operations 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated the company’s goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units was not impaired future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates from those used in acquisitionrelated valuations and goodwill impairment testing including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future due to the company’s recent acquisitions there is less headroom the difference between the carrying value and the fair value associated with several of the company’s reporting units an increase in discount rates a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect the company’s financial statements in any given year 

refer to note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill 

product warranties the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims costs of product recalls which may include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part are accrued as part of the company’s warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basispoint change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the company’s accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2021 the total accrued warranty liability was 236 million the accrual is represented as 128 million in current liabilities and 108 million in noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

refer to note 13 “product warranty” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties 

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the company’s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 18 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report the effects of any modification to those assumptions or actual results that differ from assumptions used are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

the primary assumptions affecting the company’s accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2021 are as follows 

• expected longterm rate of return on plan assets  the expected longterm rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost the required use of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned longterm returns the expected longterm rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company’s trusts and its asset allocation as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return inflation and other variables the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans’ invested assets in determining its pension expense for the year ended december 31 2021 the company used longterm rates of return on plan assets ranging from 15 to 77 outside of the us and 58 in the us 

actual returns on us pension assets were 31 and 93 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumptions of 58 and 60 respectively for the same years ended 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 54 and 40 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 40 for the same years ended 

actual returns on german pension assets were 54 and 43 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumptions of 50 and 60 respectively for the same years ended 

• discount rate  the discount rate is used to calculate pension and other postretirement employee benefit “opeb” obligations in determining the discount rate the company utilizes a fullyield approach in the estimation of service and interest components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for its significant plans the company used discount rates ranging from 091 to 350 to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december 31 2021 including weighted average discount rates of 273 in the us 197 outside of the us including 191 in the uk and 246 for us other postretirement health care plans the us and uk discount rates reflect the fact that the us and uk pension plans have been closed for new participants 

• health care cost trend  for postretirement employee health care plan accounting the company reviews external data and companyspecific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december 31 2021 the company used health care cost trend rates of 625 declining to an ultimate trend rate of 475 by the year 2026 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and opeb and its future expense 

the sensitivity to a 25 basispoint change in the assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets related to 2022 pretax pension expense for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans is expected to be negligible 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in discount rate for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its pension obligations 



the sensitivity to a 25 basispoint change in the discount rate assumption and to the assumed health care cost trend related to the company’s opeb obligation and service and interest cost is expected to be negligible 

refer to note 18 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding the company’s retirement benefit plans 

restructuring restructuring costs may occur when the company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations a restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce costs to terminate an operating lease or contract professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities 

the company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly when a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government the costs are recorded upon agreement costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

accounting for income taxes is complex in part because the company conducts business globally and therefore files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions management judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits and assessing the need for valuation allowances in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions the determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the companys global operations management judgment is required in determining the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax 

determination is less than certain accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority the company has certain us state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns that are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities at december 31 2021 the company had a liability for tax positions the company estimates are not morelikelythannot to be sustained based on the technical merits which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

the company records valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of certain deferred tax assets to amounts that it expects are more likely than not to be realized existing deferred tax assets net operating losses and tax credits by jurisdiction and expectations of the ability to utilize these tax attributes are assessed through a review of past current and estimated future taxable income and tax planning strategies 

estimates of future taxable income including income generated from prudent and feasible tax planning strategies resulting from actual or planned business and operational developments could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require the company to consider any potential impact to the assessment of the recoverability of the related deferred tax asset such potential impact could be material to the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations for an individual reporting period 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” that was signed into law in december 2017 constituted a major change to the us tax system the impact of the tax act on the company is based on management’s current interpretations of the tax act recently issued regulations and related analysis the company’s tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments or enacted changes to the us tax law in future periods its effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory or legislative developments related to us tax law

the company has established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk refer to note 17 “financial 

instruments” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2021 all of the company’s longterm debt had fixed interest rates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently the company’s most significant currency exposures relate to the brazilian real british pound chinese renminbi euro polish zloty singapore dollar korean won mexican peso thailand baht and turkish lira the company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets it serves by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of its investments in foreign markets through local currency loans the company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments in addition the company regularly enters into forward currency contracts crosscurrency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translation exchange rate risk as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the company recorded a deferred gain of 10 million and a deferred loss of 230 million respectively both before taxes for designated net investment hedges within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

the significant foreign currency translation adjustments including the impact of the net investment hedges discussed above during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 are shown in the following table which provides the percentage change in us dollars against the respective currencies and the approximate impacts of these changes recorded within other comprehensive income loss for the respective periods 





commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of its products commodity forward and option contracts are occasionally executed to offset exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the company had no outstanding commodity swap contracts

the companys automotive products are generally sold directly to oems substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts longterm supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon oem production schedules the company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the oems 

sales and marketing 

each of the company’s businesses within its reporting segments has its own sales function account executives for each of our businesses are assigned to serve specific customers for one or more businesses’ products our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with customers’ purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with customers account executives are able to identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of our products’ design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers in addition sales and marketing employees of our reporting segments often work together to explore crossdevelopment opportunities where appropriate 

seasonality 

our operations are directly related to the automotive and commercialvehicle industry consequently our segments may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent vehicle production slows such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations historically model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the company’s third quarter 

research and development 

the company conducts advanced propulsion research this advanced engineering function seeks to leverage knowhow and expertise across product lines to create new propulsion systems and modules that can be commercialized this function oversees the companys investments in certain venture capital funds that provide seed money for startup businesses developing new technologies pertinent to the automotive industry and the companys propulsion strategies

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

risks related to covid19 

we face risks related to the covid19 pandemic that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and is likely to continue to disrupt the global automotive industry and customer sales production volumes and purchases of light vehicles by end consumers in 

    

2020 global vehicle production decreased and some vehicle manufacturers at times completely shut down manufacturing operations in some countries and regions including the united states and europe as a result we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales if the global economic effects caused by covid19 continue or increase overall customer demand may continue to decrease which could have a further adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

global government directives and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 such as the imposition of travel restrictions closing of borders stayathome directives and closing of entire plants cities and countries have materially impacted our operations furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates for example the continued spread of covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which adversely impact access to capital and increase the cost of capital 

due to the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery we are not able at this time to predict the extent to which covid19 may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the extent of the impact of covid19 on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frames will depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and spread of covid19 its severity the actions to contain covid19 or treat its impact including the availability and efficacy of the vaccines and any related restrictions on travel furthermore the duration timing and severity of the impact on customer production including any recession resulting from covid19 are uncertain and cannot be predicted an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of covid19 would have a further material negative impact on our business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition though the full extent and duration are uncertain 

risks related to our acquisition of delphi technologies 

the failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of delphi technologies and other risks associated with the acquisition could adversely affect our business 

the success of our acquisition of delphi technologies will depend in part on our ability to realize the expected benefits from combining the businesses of the company and delphi technologies to realize these anticipated benefits both companies must be successfully combined which is subject to our ability to consolidate operations corporate cultures and systems and our ability to eliminate redundancies and costs if we are unsuccessful in combining our two companies the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected further there is potential for unknown or inestimable liabilities relating to the acquired delphi technologies’ businesses in addition the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process that will require significant management attention and resources it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of our operations the inability to maintain or increase our competitive presence inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters andor difficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate cultures any or all of these factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could have an adverse effect on the combined company in addition many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of these factors could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and additional diversion of 

    

management’s time and energy which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

there could be significant liability if the previous delphi technologies separation from its former parent fails to qualify as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes 

on december 4 2017 delphi technologies became an independent publiclytraded company following its separation from aptiv plc formerly known as delphi automotive plc the separation was completed in the form of a prorata distribution of 100 of delphi technologies ordinary shares to aptiv’s shareholders aptiv received an opinion from its tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution qualified as a distribution under section 355a of the internal revenue code subject to certain qualifications and limitations based on this tax treatment for us federal income tax purposes except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional delphi technologies ordinary share aptiv shareholders did not recognize a gain or loss or include any amount in their income upon the receipt of delphi technologies ordinary shares in the distribution the opinion was based on and relied on among other things certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from aptiv and delphi technologies including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied aptiv may not be able to rely on the opinion and aptiv’s shareholders could be subject to significant us federal income tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the internal revenue service could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable to aptiv’s shareholders if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion 

in addition aptiv expects that restructuring transactions that it undertook in connection with the distribution will be taxed in a certain manner if contrary to aptiv’s expectations such transactions are taxed in a different manner aptiv andor delphi technologies may incur additional tax liabilities that may be substantial if the company is required to pay any such liabilities the payments could materially adversely affect the company’s financial position 

under the tax matters agreement between aptiv and delphi technologies we are required to indemnify aptiv against taxes that aptiv incurs that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take as the case may be certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a distribution under section 355a of the code or that result in certain restructuring transactions in connection with the distribution failing to meet the requirements for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to oems 

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers additionally our competitors include startups that may be well funded with the 

    

result that they could have more operational and financial flexibility than we have a number of our competitors are larger than we are and some competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply our traditional oem customers faced with intense international competition have continued to expand their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do develop products that are superior to our products produce similar products at a cost that is lower than our cost or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors products and we may not be able to meet the growing demands of customers these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of hybrid and electric vehicles and of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fullyautomated driving experience there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ride sharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a longterm reduction in the number of vehicles per capita in addition some industry participants are exploring transportation through alternatives to automobiles these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to innovate and develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the increased adoption of gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems in western europe may materially reduce the demand for our current products 

the industry mix shift away from diesel propulsion systems in western europe has resulted and is expected to result in lower demand for current diesel components this shift is expected to drive further increased demand for gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems although we have developed and are currently in production with products for gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems and industry penetration rates for these products are expected to increase over the next several years due to the high current penetration rates of our key technologies on diesel propulsion systems this industry mix shift could adversely impact our nearterm results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

    

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply oem customers expect annual price reductions in our business to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency and streamlined product designs to reduce costs and we attempt to develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including aluminum copper nickel plastic resins steel other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any increases in the cost of materials the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to pass through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly if this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

changes in us administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations may have an adverse effect on us 

the united states has maintained tariffs on certain imported steel aluminum and items originating from china these tariffs have increased the cost of raw materials and components we purchase the imposition of tariffs by the united states has resulted in retaliatory tariffs from a number of countries including china which increase the cost of products we sell if the us or other countries impose additional tariffs that will have a further adverse impact on our business 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them our inability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business and our competitive position 

    

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology it systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

a failure of or disruption in our information technology infrastructure including a disruption related to cybersecurity could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyber attacks or failures in thirdpartyprovided services disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of information and data and that of third parties including our employees some cyber attacks depend on human error or manipulation including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or carry out disbursement of funds or other frauds which raise the risks from such events and the costs associated with protecting against such attacks although we have implemented security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruptions of our operations we have been and likely will continue to be subjected to such attacks or disruptions future attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including our intellectual property improper use of our systems and networks access to and manipulation and destruction of company or third party data production downtimes lost revenues inappropriate disbursement of funds and both internal and external supply shortages in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by such attacks or disruptions in the future these consequences could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide in particular any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees and employees with technical and software capabilities in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties 

the launch of new business is a complex process the success of which depends on a wide range of factors including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers as well as factors related to tooling equipment employees initial product quality and other factors our failure to successfully launch new business or our inability to accurately estimate the cost to design develop and launch new business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

to the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down such situations could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives and could result in our 

    

customers shifting work away from us to a competitor all of which could result in loss of revenue or loss of market share and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 12 of our us workforce was unionized we have a domestic collective bargaining agreement for one facility in new york which expires in september 2024 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

work stoppages production shutdowns and similar events could significantly disrupt our business 

because the automotive industry relies heavily on justintime delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles a work stoppage or production shutdown at one or more of our manufacturing and assembly facilities could have adverse effects on our business similarly if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage or production shutdown that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products which could result in the shutdown of the related manufacturing facilities a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage or production shutdown at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences and accordingly have an adverse effect on our financial results 

changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability 

  

we have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets is subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future additionally a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our pension expenses and reduce profitability in the future 

we also sponsor postemployment medical benefit plans in the us that are unfunded if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified this could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation management transportation and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with evolving interpretations of existing environmental health and safety laws and regulations or any new such laws and regulations including concerns about global climate change and its impact that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

    

we have liabilities related to environmental product warranties litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws and as such may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at such sites while responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at such sites is typically shared among potentially responsible parties based on an allocation formula we could have greater liability under applicable statutes refer to note 21 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions auto manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product warranty claims a recall claim brought against us or a product warranty claim brought against us could adversely impact our results of operations in addition a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate while the company maintains insurance for certain risks the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our business 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results 

we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliancerelated issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business we have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such laws however there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees agents business partners joint venture partners or representatives particularly in the case of recentlyacquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties sanctions andor fines that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and reputation 

changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate 

    

changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the inability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 

if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially affected our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production growth if any by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions 

we may not meet our goal due to many factors including any of the risks identified in the paragraph that follows failure to develop new products that our customers will purchase technology changes that could render our products obsolete and a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components among other things 

we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic representation and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity can be limited and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures the integration of companies that we have acquired or will acquire in the future may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected customer loss and business disruption including without limitation difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees customers or suppliers may be greater than expected and we may not be able to retain key employees at the acquired company we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies or realize certain synergies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

    

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe asia and the americas for 2020 approximately 80 of our consolidated net sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes international terrorism and other factors that may be discrete to a particular country or geography compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the periodend exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues expenses and capital expenditures the local currency is typically the functional currency for the companys foreign subsidiaries significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business additionally significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro korean won and chinese renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations 

because we are a us holding company one significant source of our funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic political and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the chinese market evolves we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic political social and market conditions that drive sales volumes in china economic growth has slowed in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted and our cost of borrowing or the interest rate for any subsequently issued debt would likely increase 

our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

    

we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and to optimize our product portfolio and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions 

we have initiated and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve the competitiveness of our business and sustain our margin profile optimize our product portfolio or create an optimal legal entity structure we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle among other things the level of production orders we receive is dependent on the ability of our oem customers to design and sell products that consumers desire to purchase if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders a customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2020 to ford and volkswagen constituted approximately 13 and 11 of our 2020 consolidated net sales respectively 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford stellantis and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage at one or more of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products we select suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations industry shortages labor or social unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage cyber attacks nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god” or other problems that our suppliers experience will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations in addition with 

    

fewer sources of supply for certain components each supplier may perceive that it has greater leverage and therefore some ability to seek higher prices from us at a time that we face substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products this could adversely affect our customer relations and business 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes our need to seek price reductions from our suppliers as a result of the substantial pressure we face from oems to reduce the prices of our products credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity tariffs transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advance notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

we engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts 

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs low levels of utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of fire flood or other natural disasters including pandemics and quarantines

acquisition of delphi technologies plc 

on october 1 2020 the company completed its acquisition of 100 of the outstanding ordinary shares of delphi technologies plc “delphi technologies” from the shareholders of delphi technologies pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement dated january 28 2020 as amended on may 6 2020 by and between the company and delphi technologies the “transaction agreement” pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement the company issued in exchange for each delphi technologies share 04307 of a share of common stock of the company and cash in lieu of any fractional share in the aggregate the company delivered consideration of approximately 24 billion including approximately 37 million shares of common stock of the company valued at 15 billion repayment of approximately 900 million of delphi technologies’ debt and stockbased compensation of approximately 15 million upon closing the company also assumed approximately 800 million in senior notes as discussed below the acquisition is expected to strengthen the company’s electronics and power electronics products capabilities and scale position the company for greater growth as electrified propulsion systems gain momentum and enhance key combustion commercial vehicle and aftermarket product offerings 

on october 5 2020 the company completed its offer to exchange approximately 800 million in aggregate principal amount of delphi technologies’ outstanding 5000 senior notes due 2025 the “dt notes” approximately 776 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding dt notes representing 97 of the 800 million total outstanding principal amount of the dt notes were validly exchanged and cancelled for new borgwarner notes following such cancellation approximately 24 million in aggregate principal amount of the dt notes remain outstanding since the majority of the dt notes were exchanged the company was able to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and events of default not related to payment on the 800 million in outstanding senior notes of the company

results of operations for delphi technologies are included in the company’s financial information following the date of acquisition on october 1 2020 

covid19 pandemic update 

to date covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and has resulted at times in travel restrictions closing of borders and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas many oems temporarily suspended certain manufacturing operations particularly in north america and europe due to market conditions and matters associated with covid19 furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the continued spread of covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which adversely impact the access to capital and increase the cost of capital 

in response to the outbreak and business disruption we first and foremost prioritized the health and safety of our employees as a global manufacturer we have responded to shelterinplace and similar government orders in various locations around the world including throughout the united states and europe additionally our employees must respond to selfisolation and quarantine orders based on circumstances in their local communities which continues to impact our facilities the reopening procedures related to covid19 led to a number of employee safety measures upon reopening to contain the spread including domestic and international travel restrictions workfromhome practices extensive cleaning protocols social distancing guidelines requirement for employees to wear masks and various temporary closures of or reduced operations at our manufacturing and assembly facilities 

in april 2020 we implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity these actions included but were not limited to 

• a temporary 20 reduction in base salaries of our senior executive leadership team and annual retainers of our nonemployee directors 

• up to 10 temporary base pay reductions for other salaried employees and 

• reductions in discretionary spending such as outside professional services and travel 

effective september 1 2020 all of the base pay and annual retainer reductions had been eliminated 

we continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations in these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan to date covid19 has had a material adverse impact on our revenue and overall profitability primarily in the quarter ended june 30 2020 significant reductions in automotive or truck production have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the company’s sales to oems while production levels increased in the third and fourth quarters and revenue and profitability improved covid19 continues to impact our business globally and it is possible 

    

covid19 could result in adverse impacts in the future we cannot reasonably estimate the full impacts covid19 could have on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the future 

as of december 31 2020 we had liquidity of 3650 million comprised of cash and cash equivalent balances of 1650 million and an undrawn revolving credit facility of 2000 million we were in full compliance with our covenants under the revolving credit facility and had full access to our undrawn revolving credit facility debt maturities through the end of 2021 total 45 million given our strong liquidity position we believe that the company will have sufficient liquidity and will maintain compliance with all covenants throughout the next 12 months 

results of operations 

a detailed comparison of the company’s 2018 operating results to its 2019 operating results can be found in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section in the company’s 2019 annual report on form 10k filed february 13 2020

net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 totaled 10165 million approximately the same as net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 during the three months ended december 31 2020 the delphi technologies acquisition increased revenues by 1120 million excluding this revenue total net sales declined by 11 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies primarily the euro and the net impact of the delphi technologies acquisition net sales decreased approximately 11 primarily due to covid19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020 partially offset by stronger sales in china 

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 812 and 793 in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively cost of sales associated with delphi technologies for the three months ended december 31 2020 was approximately 900 million excluding the impact of the acquisition of delphi technologies cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower sales the companys material cost of sales was approximately 57 and 55 of net sales in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 188 and 207 in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the reduction of gross margin in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic in response to the covid19 pandemic the company took numerous steps to eliminate costs however certain fixed costs could not be reduced on a temporary basis which led to a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 in addition the 27 million related to the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired had an unfavorable impact on gross margin and to a lesser extent certain lower margin business related to the acquisition of delphi technologies 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” was 951 million and 873 million or 94 and 86 of net sales for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively sga increased as a result of the three months of activity related to delphi technologies following the acquisition on october 1 2020 the increase related to delphi technologies was partially offset by savings and actions taken during the year in response to the covid19 pandemic 

research and development “rd” costs net of customer reimbursements were 476 million or 47 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 413 million or 41 of net sales in the year ended december 31 2019 the increase of rd costs net of customer reimbursements in the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to the acquisition of delphi technologies which increased rd costs by 66 million during the three months ended december 31 2020 we will continue to invest in a number of crossbusiness rd programs as well as a number of other key programs all of which are necessary for short and longterm growth our current longterm expectation for rd spending is in the range of 50 to 55 of net sales 

restructuring expense was 203 million and 72 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively primarily related to employee benefit costs the increase in 2020 was primarily due to increased costs related to the announced closure of two facilities in europe affecting approximately 550 employees and contractually required severance and stockbased compensation associated with the delphi technologies acquisition 

in february 2020 the company announced a cost restructuring plan to address existing structural costs during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recorded 148 million of restructuring expense related to this plan these actions are expected to result in a total of 300 million of restructuring costs through 2022 the resulting annual gross savings is expected to be 90 million to 100 million and will be utilized to sustain overall operating margin profile and cost competitiveness nearly all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash expenditures 

in april 2019 the company announced a cost restructuring plan including several actions to reduce existing structural costs these actions were primarily completed during fourth quarter 2019 and resulted 

    

in approximately 50 million of restructuring expense the resulting annual gross cost reduction is expected to be in the range of 40 million to 50 million by 2021 

the company recorded approximately 54 million in restructuring during the three months ended december 31 2020 related to legacy delphi technologies in conjunction with the acquisition there were contractually required severance and postcombination stockbased compensation cash payments to legacy delphi technologies executive officers and other employee termination benefits additionally in 2019 legacy delphi technologies announced a restructuring plan to reshape and realign its global technical center footprint and reduce salaried and contract staff with expected charges of up to 175 million certain of these actions are subject to consultation with employee works councils and other employee representatives the majority of these actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2021 nearly all of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash expenditures 

other operating expense income net  other represents items other than restructuring expense and was expense of 138 million and income of 147 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

in this line item for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 is merger acquisition and divestiture expense of 96 million and 11 million respectively the increase in 2020 was primarily related to professional fees associated with the acquisition of delphi technologies completed on october 1 2020 

as a result of an evaluation of the underlying technologies and management of the business subsequent to the acquisition of delphi technologies the company reduced the useful life of certain intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2020 as they no longer provided future economic benefit this resulted in accelerated amortization expense of 38 million recorded within this line item 

in addition the year ended december 31 2019 included a pretax gain of 177 million related to the derecognition of borgwarner morse tec llc “morse tec” which was a consolidated whollyowned subsidiary of the company that held asbestos and certain other liabilities and was the policyholder of the related insurance assets also related to this matter the company recorded tax expense as a result of the reversal of the previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the asbestos liabilities of 173 million resulting in an aftertax gain of 4 million refer to note 21 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information

equity in affiliates’ earnings net of tax was 18 million and 32 million in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively this line item is driven by the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures nskwarner kk turbo energy private limited “tel” and delphitvs diesel systems ltd the decrease in equity in affiliates earnings in the year ended december 31 2020 was due to lower industry volumes and cost pressures in a reduced market 

unrealized gain on equity securities was 382 million in the year ended december 31 2020 this line item reflects the net unrealized gain recognized during 2020 related to the company’s equity securities in romeo systems inc now known as romeo power inc which became a public company in december 2020 for further details see note 2 “acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

interest expense was 73 million and 55 million in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to the company’s issuance of 11 billion senior notes in june 2020 and the 800 million dt notes acquired as part of the delphi technologies acquisition 

    

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 412 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the rate of 371 for the year ended december 31 2019 for further details see note 7 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest net of tax of 67 million for the year ended december 31 2020 increased by 16 million compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was due to growth in sales in china resulting in increased profit in joint ventures and the addition of noncontrolling interests from the delphi technologies acquisition

results by reporting segment 

the companys business is comprised of four reporting segments air management epropulsion  drivetrain fuel injection and aftermarket 

the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected aftertax return on invested capital “roic” of its business initiatives roic is comprised of segment adjusted ebit after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required segment adjusted ebit is comprised of earnings before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “ebit” adjusted for restructuring goodwill impairment charges affiliates earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss segment adjusted ebit excludes certain corporate costs which primarily represents headquarters expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments corporate expenses not allocated to segment adjusted ebit were 192 million and 206 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively an increase in corporate expenses related to the acquisition of delphi technologies in 2020 was more than offset by savings and actions taken during the year in response to the covid19 pandemic including decreased compensation expense resulting in a decrease compared to 2019 

segment adjusted ebit is the measure of segment income or loss used by the company the company believes segment adjusted ebit is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments the following table shows segment adjusted ebit for the companys reporting segments 

segment adjusted earnings before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “segment adjusted ebit” 



the air management segment’s net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 536 million or 86 and segment adjusted ebit decreased 233 million or 234 from the year ended december 31 2019 the delphi technologies acquisition increased air management revenues by 312 million in 2020 excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and of strengthening foreign currencies primarily the euro net sales decreased 135 from the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease in sales was due to covid19 related production slowdowns and shutdowns during the first six months of 2020 partially offset by growing demand for the company’s products the segment adjusted ebit margin was 134 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 160 in the year ended december 31 2019 the segment adjusted ebit margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of increased warranty costs

sales in china the segment adjusted ebit margin was 90 in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 110 in the year ended december 31 2019 the segment adjusted ebit margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower net sales higher research and development spending and to a lesser extent the impact of the delphi technologies acquisition during the three months ended december 31 2020 

the fuel injection segments net sales and segment adjusted ebit for the three months december 31 2020 were 479 million and 39 million respectively the segment adjusted ebit margin was 81 in the three months ended december 31 2020 this is a new reporting segment following the acquisition of delphi technologies on october 1 2020 

the aftermarket segments net sales and segment adjusted ebit for the three months ended december 31 2020 were 194 million and 22 million respectively the segment adjusted ebit margin was 113 in the three months ended december 31 2020 this is a new reporting segment following the acquisition of delphi technologies on october 1 2020

cash flows 

operating activities 



net cash provided by operating activities was 1184 million and 1008 million in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to 2019 cash outflows related to the 2019 derecognition of morse tec a former whollyowned subsidiary of the company that held asbestos and certain other liabilities which included a contribution by the company to morse tec of approximately 172 million during 2020 there were lower net investments in working capital excluding working capital acquired in the delphi technologies acquisition partially offset by incremental retirement benefit plan contributions made in december 2020 to the the delphi technologies pension scheme in the united kingdom which is discussed further below 

    

investing activities 



net cash used in investing activities was 866 million and 489 million in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to cash outflows related to the 2020 acquisition of delphi technologies capital expenditures including tooling outlays were 40 million lower in 2020 primarily due to lower overall spending as a result of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by capital expenditures in the company’s fourth quarter from the acquisition of delphi technologies 

financing activities 



net cash provided by financing activities was 437 million in the year ended december 31 2020 and net cash used in financing activities was 420 million in the year ended december 31 2019 this increase was primarily driven by the company’s issuance of 11 billion in 2650 senior notes partially offset by the repayment of the 250 million in 4625 senior notes and higher share repurchases 

    

contractual obligations 

the companys significant contractual obligations at december 31 2020 are as follows 



 

a other postretirement employee benefits excluding pensions include anticipated future payments to cover retiree medical and life insurance benefits amount contained in “more than 5 years” column includes estimated payments through 2030 refer to note 18 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the company’s other postretirement employee benefits 

b since the timing and amount of payments for funded defined benefit pension plans are usually not certain for future years such potential payments are not shown in this table amount contained in “more than 5 years” column is for unfunded plans and includes estimated payments through 2030 refer to note 18 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the company’s pension benefits 

we believe that the combination of cash from operations cash balances available credit facilities and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth external growth debt reduction and cash conservation 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits 

the companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate at december 31 2020 all legal funding requirements had been met the company contributed 174 million 26 million and 26 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively on october 1 2020 as a result of the acquisition of delphi technologies the company assumed all of the retirementrelated liabilities of delphi technologies the most significant of which is the delphi technologies pension scheme the “scheme” in the united kingdom on december 12 2020 the company entered into a heads of terms agreement the “agreement” with the trustees of the scheme related to the future funding of the scheme under the agreement the company eliminated the prior schedule of contributions between delphi technologies and the scheme in exchange for a 137 million £100 million onetime contribution into the scheme plan by december 31 2020 which was paid on december 15 2020 the agreement also contained other provisions regarding the implementation of a revised asset investment strategy as well as a funding progress test that will be performed every three years to determine if additional contributions need to be made into the scheme by the company at this time the company anticipates that no additional contributions will be made into the scheme until 2026 at the earliest 

the company expects to contribute a total of 20 million to 30 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2021 of the 20 million to 30 million in projected 2021 contributions 6 million are contractually obligated while any remaining payments would be discretionary 

the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of 501 million and 212 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively of these amounts 139 million and 107 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively were related to plans in germany where there is no tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans hence the common practice is to 

    

make contributions as benefit payments become due additionally 186 million of the net unfunded position at december 31 2020 relates to the acquired delphi technologies pension scheme in the united kingdom which includes the 137 million contribution as discussed above 

other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the companys us operations the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of 65 million and 81 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future 

refer to note 18 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 

  

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter 

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 26 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

refer to note 21 “contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company’s environmental liability 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management 

    

has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

business combinations the company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisers for the values and lives of property identifiable intangibles and inventories and actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition if goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit the company utilizes a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred 

the company estimates the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multiperiod excess earnings method value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets which are necessary to realize those benefits the intangible asset’s estimated earnings are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying estimated earnings from contributory assets assumptions used in these calculations are considered from a market participant perspective and include revenue growth rates estimated earnings contributory asset charges customer attrition and discount rates 

the company estimates the fair value of trade names and developed technology using the relief from royalty method which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the developed technology included revenue growth rates royalty rates obsolescence factors and discount rates assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the trade name included the revenue growth rates the royalty rate and discount rate 

while the company uses its best estimates and assumptions fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings 

future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates that are used in our acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future an increase in discount rates a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year 

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under asc topic 

    

360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our longlived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy as well as competition and advances in technology adverse changes in the regulatory environment or other factors leading to reduction in expected longterm sales or profitability 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon consideration of other factors including recent acquisition restructuring or divestiture activity or to refresh the fair values the company performs a quantitative “step one” goodwill impairment analysis in addition the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

similar to goodwill the company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trade names using a qualitative analysis considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion in order to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values if the company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles using the relieffromroyalty method which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relieffromroyalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 the company performed an analysis on each reporting unit following the acquisition of delphi technologies and the resulting reorganization of the business the company elected to perform quantitative “step one” goodwill impairment analyses for certain reporting units to refresh their respective fair values this requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the company’s annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a fiveyear projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments because the projections are estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainty further the market valuation 

    

models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the company’s facts and circumstances 

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the company’s 2020 goodwill quantitative “step one” impairment review are as follows 

• discount rate the company used a 117 weighted average cost of capital “wacc” as the discount rate for future cash flows the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant 

• operating income margin the company used historical and expected operating income margins which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated 

• revenue growth rate the company used a global automotive market industry growth rate forecast adjusted to estimate its own market participation for product lines 

in addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models 

• the automotive industry is cyclical and the companys results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns 

• the company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments 

• the company is subject to risks related to international operations 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated the company’s goodwill assigned to the respective reporting units was not impaired future changes in the judgments assumptions and estimates from those used in acquisitionrelated valuations and goodwill impairment testing including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future an increase in discount rates a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year 

refer to note 12 “goodwill and other intangibles” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill 

    

product warranties the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basispoint change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2020 the total accrued warranty liability was 253 million the accrual is represented as 164 million in current liabilities and 89 million in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

refer to note 13 “product warranty” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties 

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the company’s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 18 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

    

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the company’s accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2020 are as follows 

• expected longterm rate of return on plan assets  the expected longterm rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost the required use of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned longterm returns the expected longterm rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company’s trusts and its asset allocation as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return inflation and other variables the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans’ invested assets in determining its pension expense for the year ended december 31 2020 the company used longterm rates of return on plan assets ranging from 15 to 77 outside of the us and 60 in the us 

actual returns on us pension assets were 93 and 180 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 60 for the same years ended 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 40 and 95 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 40 for the year ended december 31 2020 and 5 for the year ended in 2019 

actual returns on german pension assets were 43 and 210 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 60 for the same years ended 

• discount rate  the discount rate is used to calculate pension and other postretirement employee benefit “opeb” obligations in determining the discount rate the company utilizes a fullyield approach in the estimation of service and interest components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows the company used discount rates ranging from 048 to 1250 to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december 31 2020 including weighted average discount rates of 231 in the us 144 outside of the us including 139 in the uk and 193 for us other postretirement health care plans the us and uk discount rates reflect the fact that the us and uk pension plans have been closed for new participants 

• health care cost trend  for postretirement employee health care plan accounting the company reviews external data and companyspecific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december 31 2020 the company used health care cost trend rates of 650 declining to an ultimate trend rate of 475 by the year 2025 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and opeb and its future expense 

    

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2021 pretax pension expense 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in discount rate for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its pension obligations 



the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s total 2021 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a 25 basispoint change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost 



refer to note 18 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding the company’s retirement benefit plans 

restructuring restructuring costs may occur when the company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations a restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce costs to terminate an operating lease or contract professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities 

the company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly when a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government the costs are recorded upon agreement costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

    

accounting for income taxes is complex in part because the company conducts business globally and therefore files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions management judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions the determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the companys global operations management judgment is required in determining the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in the ordinary course of the companys business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority the company has certain us state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns which are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities at december 31 2019 the company has a liability for tax positions the company estimates are not morelikelythannot to be sustained based on the technical merits which is included in other current and noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

the tax act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the us tax system the impact of the tax act on the company is based on management’s current interpretations of the tax act recently issued regulations and related analysis the companys tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments in future periods our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to the tax act

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

    

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk refer to note 17 “financial instruments” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2020 all of the company’s longterm debt had fixed interest rates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently the companys most significant currency exposures relate to the brazil real chinese renminbi euro hungarian forint japanese yen korean won mexican peso and swedish krona the company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets it serves by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of its investments in foreign markets through local currency loans the company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts crosscurrency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translation exchange rate risk as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the company recorded a deferred loss of 204 million and a deferred gain of 4 million respectively both before taxes for net investment hedges within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

the foreign currency translation adjustments during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 are shown in the following table which provides the percentage change in us dollar against the respective currencies and the approximate impacts of these changes recorded within other comprehensive income loss for the respective periods 





    

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the company had no material outstanding commodity swap contracts the related fair value of these swaps was immaterial

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers a number of our competitors are larger than we are and some competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply our traditional oem customers faced with intense international competition have continued to expand their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do develop products that are superior to our products produce similar products at a cost that is lower than our cost or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors products and we may not be able to meet the growing demands of customers these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of hybrid and electric vehicles and of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fullyautomated driving experience there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ride sharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a longterm reduction in the number of vehicles per capita in addition some industry participants are exploring transportation through alternatives to automobiles these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to innovate and develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

the increased adoption of gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems in western europe may materially reduce the demand for our current products 

the industry mix shift away from diesel propulsion systems in western europe has resulted and is expected to result in lower demand for current diesel components this shift is expected to drive further increased demand for gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems although we have developed and are currently in production with products for gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems and industry penetration rates for these products are expected to increase over the next several years due to the high current penetration rates of our key technologies on diesel propulsion systems this industry mix shift could adversely impact our nearterm results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply oem customers expect annual price reductions in our business to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency and streamlined product designs to reduce costs and we attempt to develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including aluminum copper nickel plastic resins steel other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any increases in the cost of materials the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to pass through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly if this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

changes in us administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations may have an adverse effect on us 

the united states has implemented tariffs on imported steel and aluminum the united states has also implemented tariffs on items imported by us from china or other countries and may implement tariffs on additional products and export controls on additional items the impact of these tariffs has increased the cost of raw materials and components we purchase and additional tariffs would likely result in additional increases the imposition of tariffs by the united states has resulted in retaliatory tariffs from a number of countries including china which increase the cost of products we sell a continuing trade war could have a negative impact on the global market and a more significant adverse effect on our business the potential imposition of additional tariffs on chinese imports and imports of automobiles including 

  

cars suvs vans and light trucks and automotive parts could increase our costs and could result in lowering our gross margin on products sold 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them our inability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology it systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

a failure of or disruption in our information technology infrastructure including a disruption related to cybersecurity could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyber attacks or failures in thirdpartyprovided services disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of information and data and that of third parties including our employees some cyber attacks depend on human error or manipulation including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or carry out disbursement of funds or other frauds which raise the risks from such events and the costs associated with protecting against such attacks although we have implemented security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruptions of our operations we have been and likely will continue to be subjected to such attacks or disruptions future attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including our intellectual property improper use of our systems and networks access to and manipulation and destruction of company or third party data production downtimes lost revenues inappropriate disbursement of funds and both internal and external supply shortages in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by such attacks or disruptions in the future these consequences could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business 

  

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide in particular any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees and employees with technical and software capabilities in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties 

the launch of new business is a complex process the success of which depends on a wide range of factors including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers as well as factors related to tooling equipment employees initial product quality and other factors our failure to successfully launch new business or our inability to accurately estimate the cost to design develop and launch new business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

to the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down such situations could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives and could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor all of which could result in loss of revenue or loss of market share and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2019 approximately 13 of our us workforce was unionized we have a domestic collective bargaining agreement for one facility in new york which expires in september 2020 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

work stoppages production shutdowns and similar events could significantly disrupt our business 

because the automotive industry relies heavily on justintime delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles a work stoppage or production shutdown at one or more of our manufacturing and assembly facilities could have adverse effects on our business similarly if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage or production shutdown that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products which could result in the shutdown of the related manufacturing facilities a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage or production shutdown at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences and accordingly have an adverse effect on our financial results 

changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability 

  

we have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets is subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future additionally a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our pension expenses and reduce profitability in the future 

  

we also sponsor postemployment medical benefit plans in the us that are unfunded if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified this could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with evolving interpretations of existing environmental health and safety laws and regulations or any new such laws and regulations including concerns about global climate change and its impact that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have liabilities related to environmental product warranties litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws and as such may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at such sites while responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at such sites is typically shared among potentially responsible parties based on an allocation formula we could have greater liability under applicable statutes refer to note 15 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions auto manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product warranty claims a recall claim brought against us or a product warranty claim brought against us could adversely impact our results of operations in addition a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate while the company maintains insurance for certain risks the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our business 

  

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results 

we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliancerelated issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business we have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such laws however there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees agents business partners joint venture partners or representatives particularly in the case of recentlyacquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties sanctions andor fines that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and reputation 

changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate 

changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the inability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 

if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially affected our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than growth if any in global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions 

we may not meet our goal due to many factors including any of the risks identified in the paragraph that follows failure to develop new products that our customers will purchase technology changes that could render our products obsolete and a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components among other things 

we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic representation and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity can be limited and we can give no assurance that past or future business 

  

ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures the integration of companies that we have acquired or will acquire in the future may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected customer loss and business disruption including without limitation difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees customers or suppliers may be greater than expected and we may not be able to retain key employees at the acquired company we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies or realize certain synergies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

our proposed acquisition of delphi technologies is subject to conditions as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether or when it may be completed failure to complete the proposed transaction could adversely affect our business 

the completion of our proposed acquisition of delphi technologies is subject to a number of conditions including among other things the approval by delphi technologies stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals which make the completion and timing of the completion of the proposed transaction uncertain if the proposed transaction is not completed our business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the proposed transaction we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

• a potential decline to the market price of our common stock 

 

in addition we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the proposed transaction the materialization of any of these risks could adversely impact our ongoing businesses similarly delays in the completion of the proposed transaction could among other things result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or personnel or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the proposed transaction 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe asia and the americas for 2019 approximately 77 of our consolidated net sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes international terrorism and other factors that may be discrete to a particular country or geography compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

  

the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the periodend exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues expenses and capital expenditures the local currency is typically the functional currency for the companys foreign subsidiaries significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business additionally significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro korean won and chinese renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations 

because we are a us holding company one significant source of our funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic political and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the chinese market evolves we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic political social and market conditions that drive sales volumes in china in fact recently economic growth has slowed in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted and our cost of borrowing or the interest rate for any subsequently issued debt would likely increase 

our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and to optimize our product portfolio and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions 

we have initiated and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve the competitiveness of our business and sustain our margin profile optimize our product portfolio or create an optimal legal entity structure we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle among other things the level of production orders we receive is dependent on the ability of our oem customers to design and sell products that consumers desire to purchase if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders a customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2019 to ford and volkswagen constituted approximately 15 and 11 of our 2019 consolidated net sales respectively 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford fiat chrysler automobiles and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage at one or more of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products we select suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations industry shortages labor or social unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage cyber attacks nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems that our suppliers experience will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations in addition with fewer sources of supply for certain components each supplier may perceive that it has greater leverage and therefore some ability to seek higher prices from us at a time that we face substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products this could adversely affect our customer relations and business 

  

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes our need to seek price reductions from our suppliers as a result of the substantial pressure we face from oems to reduce the prices of our products credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity tariffs transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advance notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

we engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts 

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs low levels of utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of fire flood or other natural disasters including pandemics and quarantines

proposed acquisition of delphi technologies plc 

on january 28 2020 the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire delphi technologies plc “delphi technologies” in an allstock transaction valued at approximately 33 billion based on the closing price of borgwarner stock on january 27 2020 refer to note 23 “subsequent event” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information the company expects to pay fees costs and expenses associated with the transaction with available cash the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations does not address matters associated with the anticipated acquisition 

  

results of operations 

a detailed comparison of the company’s 2017 operating results to its 2018 operating results can be found in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section in the company’s 2018 annual report on form 10k filed february 19 2019 

a summary of our operating results for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 is as follows 



  

noncomparable items impacting the companys earnings per diluted share and net earnings 

the companys earnings per diluted share were 361 and 444 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the noncomparable items presented below are calculated after tax using the corresponding effective tax rate and the weighted average number of diluted shares for each of the years then ended the company believes the following table is useful in highlighting noncomparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share 



a summary of noncomparable items impacting the company’s net earnings for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 is as follows 

year ended december 31 2019 

  



  

 

year ended december 31 2018 



  

 

net sales 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 10168 million  a 34 decrease from the year ended december 31 2018 excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures net sales increased 07 

the following table details our results of operations as a percentage of net sales 



cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 793 and 788 in the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the companys material cost of sales was approximately 55 of net sales in the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 207 and 212 in the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the reduction of gross margin in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the impact of lower revenue the increased cost from tariffs and supplier cost reductions not keeping pace with normal customer price deflation 

  

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” was 873 million and 946 million  or 86 and 90 of net sales for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in sga expenses was primarily due to stockbased compensation expense and cost control measures

pension and other postretirement employee benefits 

the companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate at december 31 2019 all legal funding requirements had been met the company contributed 26 million  26 million and 18 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the company expects to contribute a total of 10 million to 20 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2020 of the 10 million to 20 million in projected 2020 contributions 4 million are contractually obligated while any remaining payments would be discretionary 

the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of 212 million and 211 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively of these amounts 107 million and 95 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively were related to plans in germany where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due 

other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the companys us operations the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of 81 million and 87 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter 

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 14 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

refer to note 15 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company’s environmental liability 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of control of our products although the company may enter into longterm supply arrangements with its major customers the prices and volumes are not fixed over the life of the arrangements and a contract does not exist for purposes of applying accounting standards codification asc topic 606 until volumes are contractually known for most of our products transfer of control occurs upon shipment or delivery 

  

however a limited number of our customer arrangements for our highly customized products with no alternative use provide us with the right to payment during the production process as a result for these limited arrangements revenue is recognized as goods are produced and control transfers to the customer revenue is measured at the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the good 

the company continually seeks business development opportunities and at times provides customer incentives for new program awards customer incentive payments are capitalized when the payments are incremental and incurred only if the new business is obtained and these amounts are expected to be recovered from the customer over the term of the new business arrangement the company recognizes a reduction to revenue as products that the upfront payments are related to are transferred to the customer based on the total amount of products expected to be sold over the term of the arrangement generally 3 to 7 years the company evaluates the amounts capitalized each period end for recoverability and expenses any amounts that are no longer expected to be recovered over the term of the business arrangement 

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under asc topic 360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our longlived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy as well as competition and advances in technology adverse changes in the regulatory environment or other factors leading to reduction in expected longterm sales or profitability 

assets and liabilities held for sale the company classifies assets and liabilities disposal groups to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the disposal group the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated the sale of the disposal group is probable and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year except if events or circumstances beyond the companys control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 

  

the company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met conversely gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale the company assesses the fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale additionally depreciation is not recorded during the period in which the longlived assets included in the disposal group are classified as held for sale 

upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale the company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group if material in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet 

refer to note 20 assets and liabilities held for sale to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon consideration of other factors including recent acquisition restructuring or divestiture activity or to refresh the fair values the company performs a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis in addition the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

similar to goodwill the company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trade names using a qualitative analysis considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion in order to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values if the company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date the company estimates the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles using the relieffromroyalty method which it believes is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relieffromroyalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company performed an analysis on each reporting unit based on the factors above the company elected to perform quantitative step one goodwill impairment analyses on three reporting units this requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a fiveyear projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances 

  

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2019 goodwill quantitative step one impairment review are as follows 

 

 

 

i n addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models 

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2019 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to the reporting units that were quantitatively assessed were not impaired and contained fair values substantially higher than the reporting units carrying values additionally for the reporting units quantitatively assessed sensitivity analyses were completed indicating that a one percentage point increase in the discount rate a one percentage point decrease in the operating margin or a one percentage point decrease in the revenue growth rate assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value 

refer to note 7 goodwill and other intangibles to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill 

product warranties the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual 



  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2019 the total accrued warranty liability was 116 million  the accrual is represented as 63 million in current liabilities and 53 million in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet

asbestos like many other industrial companies that have historically operated in the united states the company or parties that the company is obligated to indemnify has been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions morse tec a former whollyowned subsidiary of the company was the obligor for the companys recorded asbestosrelated liabilities and the policyholder of the related insurance assets on october 30 2019 the company transferred 100 of its equity interests to enstar holdings us llc in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company derecognized morse tec and removed asbestos obligations related insurance assets and associated deferred tax assets from the consolidated balance sheet 

with the assistance of a thirdparty actuary the company estimated the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims not yet asserted to extend through december 31 2064 with a runoff through 2074 and defense costs this estimate was based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed based on anticipated levels of unique plaintiff asbestosrelated claims in the us tort system against all defendants as with any estimates actual experience may differ this estimate was not discounted to present value the company believed that december 31 2074 was a reasonable assumption as to the last date on which it was likely to have resolved all asbestosrelated claims based on the nature and useful life of the company’s products and the likelihood of incidence of asbestosrelated disease in the us population generally the company assessed the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims not yet asserted and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in claim resolution costs in addition to claims experience the company considered additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company continued to have additional excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated claims in connection with the company’s review of its asbestosrelated claims the company also reviewed the amount of its potential insurance coverage for such claims taking into account the remaining limits of such coverage the number and amount of claims on the companys insurance from coinsured parties ongoing litigation against the company’s insurance carriers potential remaining recoveries from insolvent insurance carriers the impact of previous insurance settlements and coverage available from solvent insurance carriers not party to the coverage litigation

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined 

  

benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 12 retirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2019 are as follows 

 

actual returns on us pension assets were 180 and 41 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 60 for the same years ended 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 95 and 31 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 5 for the year ended december 31 2019 and 6 for the year ended in 2018 

actual returns on german pension assets were 210 and 42 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 59 for the same years ended 

 



  

health care cost trend rate assumptions in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december 31 2019 the company used health care cost trend rates of 625  declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5 by the year 2025 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and opeb and its future expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2020 pretax pension expense 



 

 a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company’s us 2020 pretax pension expense 

the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the companys total 2020 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost

restructuring restructuring costs may occur when the company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations a restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce costs to terminate an operating lease or contract professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities 

the company generally records costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance costs for involuntary separation programs are recorded when management has approved the plan for separation the employees are identified and aware of the benefits they are entitled to and it is unlikely that the plan will change significantly when a plan of separation requires approval by or consultation with the relevant labor organization or government the costs are recorded upon agreement costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax 

  

bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

accounting for income taxes is complex in part because the company conducts business globally and therefore files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions management judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities including accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions the determination of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits includes the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions across the companys global operations management judgment is required in determining the accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in the ordinary course of the companys business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are established when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority the company has certain us state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns which are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities at december 31 2019 the company has a liability for tax positions the company estimates are not morelikelythannot to be sustained based on the technical merits which is included in other current and noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

the tax act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the us tax system the impact of the tax act on the company is based on management’s current interpretations of the tax act recently issued regulations and related analysis the companys tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments in future periods our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to the tax act

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk refer to note 11 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2019 all of the companys debt had fixed interest rates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the chinese renminbi the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen the mexican peso the swedish krona and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans such nonus dollar debt was 41 million and 47 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments the depreciation of the british pound following the united kingdoms 2016 vote to leave the european union has not and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company since net sales from the united kingdom represent less than 2 of the companys net sales in 2019 in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2018 the company recorded a deferred gain of 2 million and a deferred loss of 2 million related to foreign currency derivatives as of december 31 2019 deferred gains and losses related to foreign currency derivatives were immaterial 

the foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 55 million and foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 148 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively contained within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our nonus dollar subsidiaries financial statements to the company’s reporting currency us dollar and the related gains and losses arising from our net investment hedges the 2019 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar against the euro chinese renminbi and swedish krona which which increased approximately 2 1 and 6 and increased other comprehensive loss by 

  

approximately 18 million 17 million and 15 million respectively the 2018 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar against the euro and chinese renminbi which increased approximately 4 and 5 and increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 58 million and 48 million respectively in addition the company periodically enters into foreign currency contracts crosscurrency swaps and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges to reduce exposure to translational exchange rate risk as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the company recorded a deferred gain of 4 million and a deferred loss of 14 million respectively for net investment hedges 

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the company had outstanding commodity swap contracts with total notional values of 1 million and 2 million respectively the related fair value of these swaps were immaterial

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers a number of our competitors are larger than we are and some competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do develop products that are superior to our products produce 

  

  

similar products at a cost that is lower than our cost or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors products and we may not be able to meet the growing demands of customers these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of hybrid and electric vehicles and of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fullyautomated driving experience there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ridesharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a longterm reduction in the number of vehicles per capita in addition some industry participants are exploring transportation through alternatives to automobiles these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the increased adoption of gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems in western europe may materially reduce the demand for our current products 

the industry mix shift away from diesel propulsion systems in western europe may result in lower demand for current diesel components this shift is expected to drive increased demand for gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems we have developed and are currently in production with products for gasoline and hybrid propulsion systems industry penetration rates for these products are expected to increase significantly over the next several years however due to the high current penetration rates of our key technologies on diesel propulsion systems this industry mix shift could adversely impact our nearterm results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply annual price reductions to oem customers are a permanent component of our business to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency and updated product designs to reduce costs and we attempt to develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including aluminum copper nickel plastic resins steel other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any increases in the cost of materials the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

  

  

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

changes in us administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations may have an adverse effect on us 

the united states has implemented tariffs on imported steel and aluminum as well as certain other listed products imported from china the united states is also considering implementing new tariffs on items imported by us from china or other countries and export controls on additional items the impact of these tariffs could increase the cost of raw materials or components we purchase the imposition of tariffs by the united states has resulted in retaliatory tariffs from a number of countries including china which could increase the cost of products we sell any resulting trade war could have a negative impact on the global market and an adverse effect on our business the potential imposition of additional tariffs on chinese imports and imports of automobiles including cars suvs vans and light trucks and automotive parts could increase our costs and could result in lowering our gross margin on products sold 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them our inability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology it systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

  

  

a failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyberattacks or failures in thirdpartyprovided services disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of information and data and that of third parties including our employees as a result such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including our intellectual property improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by such attacks or disruptions in the future this could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide in particular any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees and employees with technical and software capabilities in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

our profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties 

the launch of new business is a complex process the success of which depends on a wide range of factors including the production readiness of our manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers as well as factors related to tooling equipment employees initial product quality and other factors our failure to successfully launch new business or our inability to accurately estimate the cost to design develop and launch new business could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

to the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down such situations could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives and could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor all of which could result in loss of revenue or loss of market share and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2018 approximately 15  of our us workforce was unionized we have a domestic collective bargaining agreement for one facility in new york which expires in september 2020 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

work stoppages and similar events could significantly disrupt our business 

because the automotive industry relies heavily on justintime delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles a work stoppage at one or more of our manufacturing and assembly facilities could have adverse effects on our business similarly if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products which could result in the shutdown of the related manufacturing facilities a significant disruption in the supply of a key 

  

  

component due to a work stoppage at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences and accordingly have an adverse effect on our financial results 

changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability 

  

we have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets is subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future additionally a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our pension expenses and reduce profitability in the future 

we also sponsor postemployment medical benefit plans in the us that are unfunded if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified this could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with evolving interpretations of existing environmental health and safety laws and regulations or any new such laws and regulations including concerns about global climate change and its impact that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have liabilities related to environmental product warranties litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws and as such may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at such sites while responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at such sites is typically shared among potentially responsible parties based on an allocation formula we could have greater liability under applicable statutes refer to note 15 contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions auto manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product warranty claims a recall claim brought against us or a product warranty claim brought against us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

  

  

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate while the company maintains insurance for certain risks the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our business 

we have faced and in the future expect to face substantial numbers of asbestosrelated claims the cost of resolving those claims is inherently uncertain and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have in the past been named in a significant number of lawsuits each year alleging injury related to exposure to asbestos in certain of our historical products we no longer manufacture distribute or sell products that contain asbestos we vigorously defend against asbestosrelated claims despite these factors asbestosrelated claims may be asserted against us in the future and the number of those claims may be substantial we have estimated the claim resolution costs and associated defense costs relating to the asbestosrelated claims that have been asserted against us but not yet resolved as well as those asbestosrelated claims that we estimate may be asserted against us in the future our estimate of future asbestosrelated claims that may be asserted against us is based on assumptions as to the likely rates of occurrence of asbestosrelated disease in the us population in the future and the number of asbestosrelated claims asserted as a result furthermore our estimates are based on a number of assumptions derived from our historical experience in resolving asbestosrelated claims including 

 

if our actual experience as noted above in receiving and resolving asbestosrelated claims in the future differs significantly from these assumptions then our expenditures to resolve such claims may be significantly higher or lower than the estimates contained in our financial statements and if they are higher they could have an adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows that is greater than we have estimated see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other matters  contingencies  asbestosrelated liability” 

while we have certain insurance coverage available respecting asbestosrelated claims asserted against us substantially all of that insurance coverage is the subject of pending litigation the insurance that is at issue in the litigation is subject to various uncertainties including the assertion of defenses or the development of facts of which we are not presently aware changes in the case law and future financial viability of remaining insurance carriers this insurance coverage is additionally subject to claims from other coinsured parties we currently project that our remaining insurance coverage for current and future asbestosrelated claims will cover only a portion of the amounts that we estimate we ultimately may pay to resolve such claims the resolution of the insurance coverage litigation and the number and amount of claims on our insurance from coinsured parties may increase or decrease the amount of insurance coverage available to us for asbestosrelated claims from the estimates contained in our financial statements 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results 

we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliancerelated issues in certain countries 

  

  

associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws could adversely affect our business we have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such laws however there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees agents business partners joint venture partners or representatives particularly in the case of recentlyacquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties sanctions andor fines that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and reputation 

changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate 

changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the inability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 

if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially affected our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “ tax act” was enacted into law which significantly changed existing us tax law and included many provisions applicable to the company such as reducing the us federal statutory tax rate imposing a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system the tax act reduced the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the tax act also includes a provision to tax global intangible lowtaxed income of foreign subsidiaries a special tax deduction for foreignderived intangible income and a base erosion antiabuse tax measure that may tax certain payments between a us corporation and its subsidiaries these additional provisions of the tax act were effective beginning january 1 2018 in future periods our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to the tax act furthermore changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant fluctuations in our effective tax rates refer to note 5 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding income taxes 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than growth if any in global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions 

  

  

we may not meet our goal because of any of the risks in the following paragraph or other factors such as the failure to develop new products that our customers will purchase and technology changes rendering our products obsolete and a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components 

we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic representation and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity can be limited and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures the integration of companies that we have acquired or will acquire in the future may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected customer loss and business disruption including without limitation difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees customers or suppliers may be greater than expected and we may not be able to retain key employees at the acquired company we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe asia and the americas for 2018 approximately 77  of our consolidated net sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the periodend exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues expenses and capital expenditures the local currency is typically the functional currency for the companys foreign subsidiaries significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business additionally significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro korean won and chinese renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations 

because we are a us holding company one significant source of our funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

  

  

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic political and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the chinese market evolves we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic political and market conditions that drive sales volumes in china in fact recently economic growth has slowed in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted and our cost of borrowing or the interest rate for any subsequently issued debt would likely increase 

our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and to optimize our product portfolio and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions 

  

we have initiated and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness enhance treasury management flexibility optimize our product portfolio or create an optimal legal entity structure we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle among other things the level of production orders we receive is dependent on the ability of our oem customers to design and sell products that consumers desire to purchase if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders a customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2018 to ford and volkswagen constituted approximately 14  and 12  of our 2018 consolidated net sales respectively 

  

  

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford fiat chrysler automobiles and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage at one or more of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products we select suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations industry shortages labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage cyberattacks nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems that our suppliers experience will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations in addition with fewer sources of supply for certain components each supplier may perceive that it has greater leverage and therefore some ability to seek higher prices from us at a time that we face substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products this could adversely affect our customer relations and business 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes our need to seek price reductions from our suppliers as a result of the substantial pressure we face from oems to reduce the prices of our products credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity tariffs transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advance notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

we engage in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties we are subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts 

  

  

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of fire flood or other natural disasters

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter 

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 28 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either 

  

  

the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

refer to note 15  contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company’s environmental liability

refer to note 15  contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company’s asbestosrelated liability and corresponding insurance asset 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of control of our products although the company may enter into longterm supply arrangements with its major customers the prices and volumes are not fixed over the life of the arrangements and a contract does not exist for purposes of applying asc 606 until volumes are contractually known for most of our products transfer of control occurs upon shipment or delivery however a limited number of our customer arrangements for our highly customized products with no alternative use provide us with the right to payment during the production process as a result for these limited arrangements revenue is recognized as goods are produced and control transfers to the customer revenue is measured at the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the good 

the company continually seeks business development opportunities and at times provides customer incentives for new program awards customer incentive payments are capitalized when the payments are incremental and incurred only if the new business is obtained and these amounts are expected to be recovered from the customer over the term of the new business arrangement the company recognizes a reduction to revenue as products that the upfront payments are related to are transferred to the customer based on the total amount of products expected to be sold over the term of the arrangement generally 3 to 7 years the company evaluates the amounts capitalized each period end for recoverability and expenses any amounts that are no longer expected to be recovered over the term of the business arrangement 

  

  

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic 360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our longlived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy as well as competition and advances in technology adverse changes in the regulatory environment or other factors leading to reduction in expected longterm sales or profitability 

assets and liabilities held for sale   the company classifies assets and liabilities disposal groups to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the disposal group the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated the sale of the disposal group is probable and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year except if events or circumstances beyond the companys control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 

the company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met conversely gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale the company assesses the fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 

upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale the company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group if material in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet 

refer to note 20 assets and liabilities held for sale to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets   during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative 

  

  

assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon consideration of other factors including recent acquisition restructuring or divestiture activity the company performs a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis in addition the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value     

similar to goodwill the company can elect to perform the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trade names using a qualitative analysis considering similar factors as outlined in the goodwill discussion in order to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the trade names is less than the respective carrying values if the company elects to perform or is required to perform a quantitative analysis the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe is an appropriate and widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relieffromroyalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trade names and not being required to pay a royalty for their use   

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company performed an analysis on each reporting unit for the reporting unit with restructuring activities the company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a fiveyear projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances   

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2018 goodwill quantitative step one impairment review are as follows   

 

 

 

  

  

i n addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models   

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to the reporting unit with restructuring activity that was quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained a fair value substantially higher than the reporting units carrying value additionally for the reporting unit quantitatively assessed sensitivity analyses were completed indicating that a   one   percent increase in the discount rate a   one  percent decrease in the operating margin or a one percent decrease in the revenue growth rate assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value

product warranties   the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2018 the total accrued warranty liability was 1032 million  the accrual is represented as 562 million  in current liabilities and 470 million  in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 12 retirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

  

  

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2018 are as follows 

 

actual returns on us pension assets were 41 115 and 59 for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 60 for the same years ended 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 31 97 and 220 for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 60 for the same years ended 

actual returns on german pension assets were 42 70 and 86 for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 59 for the same years ended 

 

 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and opeb and its future expense 

  

  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2019 pretax pension expense 



 

 a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company’s us 2019 pretax pension expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 



the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the companys total 2019 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost

restructuring restructuring costs may occur when the company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations a restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce costs to terminate an operating lease or contract professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in 

  

  

determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 740 the company’s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2018 the company has a liability for significant tax positions the company estimates are not morelikelythannot to be sustained based on the technical merits which is included in other current and noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

the tax act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the us tax system the impact of the tax act on the company is based on management’s current interpretations of the tax act recently issued regulations and related analysis the companys tax liability may be materially different based on regulatory developments in future periods our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to act

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk refer to note 11 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk 

  

  

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2018 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 998 of total debt our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt resulted in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 01 million and 01 million in the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the chinese renminbi the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen the mexican peso the swedish krona and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans such nonus dollar debt was 472 million and 592 million as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments the depreciation of the british pound following the united kingdoms 2016 vote to leave the european union is not expected to have a significant impact on the company since net sales from the united kingdom represent less than 2 of the companys net sales in 2018 in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the company recorded a deferred gain related to foreign currency derivatives of 17 million and 16 million respectively and deferred loss related to foreign currency derivatives of 15 million and 39 million respectively 

the foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 1476 million  foreign currency translation adjustment gain of 2365 million  and foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 1091 million  for the year ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively contained within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our nonus dollar subsidiaries financial statements to the company’s reporting currency us dollar the 2018 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar against the euro and chinese renminbi which increased approximately 4 and 5 and increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 102 million and 48 million respectively the 2017 foreign currency translation adjustment gain was primarily due to the impact of a weakening us dollar against the euro which decreased approximately 14 and increased other comprehensive income by approximately 266 million since december 31 2016 the 2016 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar against the euro and chinese renminbi which increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 60 million and 45 million respectively 

  

  

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the company had commodity swap contracts with a total notional value of 17 million and a recorded shortterm deferred loss of 02 million as of december 31 2017 the company had no commodity swap contracts outstanding

financial information about geographic areas 

during the year ended december 31 2017 approximately 77  of the companys consolidated net sales were outside the united states us attributing sales to the location of production rather than the location of the customer 

refer to note 20 “reporting segments and related information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas 

product lines and customers 

during the year ended december 31 2017 approximately 82 of the companys net sales were for lightvehicle applications approximately 10 were for commercial vehicle applications approximately 4 were for offhighway vehicle applications and approximately 4 were to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts 

the company’s worldwide net sales to the following customers including their subsidiaries were approximately as follows 



no other single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in any of the years presented 

  

  

the companys automotive products are generally sold directly to oems substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts longterm supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon oem production schedules the company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the oems 

sales and marketing 

each of the companys businesses within its two reporting segments has its own sales function account executives for each of our businesses are assigned to serve specific customers for one or more businesses products our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with customers purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with customers account executives are able to identify and meet customers needs based upon their knowledge of our products design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers in addition sales and marketing employees of our engine and drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore crossdevelopment opportunities where appropriate 

seasonality 

our operations are directly related to the automotive industry consequently we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations historically model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter 

research and development 

the company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at the reporting segment level this advanced engineering function seeks to leverage knowhow and expertise across product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized this function manages a venture capital fund that was created by the company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses

 item 1a risk factors   

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to oems 

  

  

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers a number of our competitors are larger than us and some competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business 

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply annual price reductions to oem customers are a permanent component of our business to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency updated product designs to reduce costs and we develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including aluminum copper nickel plastic resins steel other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop 

  

  

technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce these rights could adversely affect our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology it systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

a failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyberattacks or failures in thirdpartyprovided services disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our thirdparty data as a result such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including our intellectual property improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages this could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2017 approximately 15  of our us workforce was unionized we have a domestic collective bargaining agreement for one facility in new york which expires in september 2020 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

  

changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability 

  

we have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future additionally a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our pension expenses and reduce profitability in the future 

we also sponsor postemployment medical benefit plans in the us that are unfunded if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified this could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving interpretations of existing environmental health and safety laws and regulations or any new such laws and regulations that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have liabilities related to environmental product warranties litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate while the company maintains insurance for certain risks the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our business 

  

  

we have faced and in the future expect to face substantial numbers of asbestosrelated claims the cost of resolving those claims is inherently uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have in the past been named in a significant number of lawsuits each year alleging injury related to exposure to asbestos in certain of our historical products we no longer manufacture distribute or sell products that contain asbestos we vigorously defend against asbestosrelated claims and we have historically been successful in getting the majority of such claims dismissed without payment notwithstanding these factors asbestosrelated claims may be asserted against us in the future and the number of those claims may be substantial we have estimated the indemnity and defense costs relating to the asbestosrelated claims that have been asserted against us but not yet resolved as well as those asbestosrelated claims that we estimate may be asserted against us in the future our estimate of future asbestosrelated claims that may be asserted against us is based on assumptions as to the likely rates of occurrence of asbestosrelated disease in the us population in the future and the number of asbestosrelated claims asserted as a result furthermore our estimates are based on a number of assumptions derived from our historical experience in resolving asbestosrelated claims including 

 

if our actual experience as noted above in receiving and resolving asbestosrelated claims in the future differs significantly from these assumptions then our expenditures to resolve such claims may be significantly higher or lower than the estimates contained in our financial statements and if higher could have an adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows that is greater than we have estimated see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other matters  contingencies  asbestosrelated liability” 

while we have certain insurance coverage available respecting asbestosrelated claims asserted against us substantially all of that insurance coverage is the subject of pending litigation the insurance that is at issue in the litigation is subject to various uncertainties including the assertion of defenses or the development of facts of which we are not presently aware changes in the case law and future financial viability of remaining insurers this insurance coverage is additionally subject to claims from other coinsured parties we currently project that our remaining insurance coverage for current and future asbestosrelated claims will cover only a portion of the amounts that we estimate we ultimately may pay to resolve such claims the resolution of the insurance coverage litigation and the number and amount of claims on our insurance from coinsured parties may increase or decrease the amount of insurance coverage available to us for asbestosrelated claims from the estimates contained in our financial statements 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliance related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws could also adversely affect our business 

changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate or 

  

  

intend to operate in addition government disruptions such as government shutdowns may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the inability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 

if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially affected our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the us tax system the estimated impact of the law is based on management’s current interpretations of the act and related assumptions our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates based on regulatory developments and our further analysis of the impacts of the act in future periods our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to the act furthermore changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant fluctuations in our effective tax rates 

because we are a us holding company one significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions 

we may not meet our goal because of any of the following or other factors a the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete and c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components 

we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic representation and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may 

  

  

not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures the integration of companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected customer loss and business disruption including without limitation difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees customers or suppliers may be greater than expected and the retention of key employees at the acquired company may not be achieved we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe asia and the americas for 2017 approximately 77  of our consolidated net sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the periodend exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues expenses and capital expenditures the local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys foreign subsidiaries significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business additionally significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro korean won and chinese renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic political and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the chinese market evolves we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic political and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted and our cost of borrowing or the interest rate for any subsequently issued debt would likely increase 

our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in 

  

  

our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability competitiveness and to optimize our product portfolio and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions 

  

we have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability competitiveness enhance treasury management flexibility optimize our product portfolio or create an optimal legal entity structure we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders a customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2017 to ford and volkswagen constituted approximately 15  and 13  of our 2017 consolidated net sales respectively 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford fiat chrysler automobiles and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage at one or more of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage cyber attacks nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other 

  

  

sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this could adversely affect our customer relations and business 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advance notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of legal claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and other services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the companys business insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts 

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of fire flood or other natural disasters

results by reporting segment 

the companys business is comprised of two reporting segments engine and drivetrain these segments are strategic business groups which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems 

the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected aftertax return on invested capital roic of its business initiatives roic is comprised of adjusted ebit after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required adjusted ebit is comprised of earnings before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “ebit adjusted for restructuring goodwill impairment charges affiliates earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss 

adjusted ebit is the measure of segment income or loss used by the company the company believes adjusted ebit is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments 

the following tables show segment information and adjusted ebit for the companys reporting segments 

  

  

net sales by reporting segment 



adjusted earnings before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest adjusted ebit 



the engine  segments net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 4714 million  or 84  and segment adjusted ebit increased 484 million  or 51  from the year ended december 31 2016 excluding the impact of strengthening foreign currencies primarily the euro and korean won net sales increased 77 from the year ended december 31 2016 due to higher sales of light vehicle turbochargers thermal products engine timing systems and stronger commercial vehicle markets around the world the segment adjusted ebit margin was 164  for the year ended december 31 2017 down from 169  in the year ended december 31 2016 the adjusted ebit margin decrease was primarily related to inefficiencies in the noncore emission product lines in the third quarter of 2017 the company initiated actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness and started exploring strategic options for the noncore emission product lines see the restructuring footnote to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the engine segments net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 901 million  or 16  and segment adjusted ebit increased 334 million  or 37  from the year ended december 31 2015 excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies primarily the euro chinese renminbi and 

  

  

korean won net sales increased 31 from the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to higher sales of light vehicle turbochargers and engine timing systems including variable cam timing partially offset by weak aftermarket and commercial vehicle markets around the world the segment adjusted ebit margin was 169  for the year ended december 31 2016 up from 166  in the year ended december 31 2015 

the drivetrain  segments net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 2666 million  or 76  and segment adjusted ebit increased 853 million  or 234  from the year ended december 31 2016 excluding the impact of strengthening foreign currencies primarily the euro and korean won and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures net sales increased 149 from the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to higher sales of allwheel drive systems and transmission components the segment adjusted ebit margin was 119  in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 103  in the year ended december 31 2016 the adjusted ebit margin improvement was primarily due to increased sales and the divestiture of the remy light vehicle aftermarket business 

the drivetrain segments net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 9670 million  or 378  and segment adjusted ebit increased 599 million  or 197  from the year ended december 31 2015 excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies primarily the euro chinese renminbi and korean won and the 2015 remy acquisition net sales increased 99 from the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to higher sales of allwheel drive systems the segment adjusted ebit margin was 103  in the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 119  in the year ended december 31 2015 

corporate  represents headquarters expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments and equity in affiliates earnings this net expense was 1703 million  1553 million  and 1364 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase of corporate expenses in 2017 is primarily due to costs associated with talent acquisition and severance expenses stockbased compensation compliance costs and various other corporate initiatives 

outlook 

our overall outlook for 2018 is positive net new businessrelated sales growth due to increased penetration of borgwarner products around the world is expected to drive growth above the modest global industry production growth expected in 2018 

the company maintains a positive longterm outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy the several trends that are driving our longterm growth are expected to continue including the increased turbocharger adoption in north america and asia the increased adoption of automated transmissions in europe and asiapacific and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in europe and asiapacific our longterm growth is also expected to benefit from the adoption of product offerings for hybrid and electric vehicles 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multicurrency revolving credit agreement at december 31 2017 the company had 5453 million  of cash of which 5412 million of cash was held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states cash held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments including acquisitions the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation however doing so could result in increased foreign and us state and local income taxes as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017the act the company has recorded a liability for the us federal and applicable state income tax liabilities calculated under the provisions of the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as of january 1 2018 funds repatriated from foreign subsidiaries will generally no longer be taxable for 

  

  

us federal tax purposes a deferred tax liability has been recorded for all estimated legally distributable foreign earnings the company uses its us liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes including but not limited to debt service share repurchases dividend distributions and other corporate expenses 

the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred we believe the impact of the act on liquidity sources as of december 31 2017 is insignificant 

on june 29 2017 the company amended and extended its   1 billion   multicurrency revolving credit facility which included a feature that allowed the companys borrowings to be increased to   125 billion  to a   12 billion   multicurrency revolving credit facility which includes a feature that allows the companys borrowings to be increased to 15 billion  the facility provides for borrowings through june 29 2022   the company has one key financial covenant as part of the credit agreement which is a debt to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio the company was in compliance with the financial covenant at december 31 2017 and expects to remain compliant in future periods   at december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 the company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility 

the companys commercial paper program allows the company to issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding which increased from

the total current combined borrowing capacity under the multicurrency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed   12 billion  

in addition to the credit facility the companys universal shelf registration has an unlimited amount of various debt and equity instruments that could be issued 

on february 08 2017 april 26 2017 and july 26 2017 the company’s board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of 014  per share of common stock on november 8 2017 the company’s board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of 017  per share of common stock these dividends were paid in the 12 months ended december 31 2017 

the companys net debt to net capital ratio was 300  at december 31 2017 versus 350  at december 31 2016 

from a credit quality perspective the company has a credit rating of bbb from both standard  poors and fitch ratings and baa1 from moodys the current outlook from standard  poors and fitch ratings is stable in october 2017 moody’s reaffirmed the company’s credit rating of “baa1” and revised the rating outlook to stable from negative none of the companys debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings

the companys significant contractual obligation payments at december 31 2017 are as follows 



 

 

we believe that the combination of cash from operations cash balances available credit facilities and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth external growth debt reduction and cash conservation

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the 

  

  

companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter 

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 27 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

refer to note 14  contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company’s environmental liability 

asbestosrelated liability 

like many other industrial companies that have historically operated in the united states the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions the company has an estimated liability of 8282 million  as of december 31 2017 for asbestosrelated claims and associated costs through 2067 which is the last date by which the company currently estimates it may have resolved all asbestosrelated claims the company additionally estimates that as of december 31 2017 it has aggregate insurance coverage available in the amount of 3864 million  to satisfy asbestosrelated claims and associated defense costs 

refer to note 14  contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further details and information respecting the company’s asbestosrelated liability and corresponding insurance asset 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial 

  

  

statements and the accompanying notes as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

concentration of risk the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers and customers and with the exception of certain financing transactions does not require collateral from its oem customers some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity these factors have increased pressure on the industrys supply base as suppliers cope with changing commodity costs lower production volumes and other challenges the company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers the inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future operating results 

revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

cost of sales   the company includes materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials indirect labor factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale 

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic 360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our longlived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy as well as competition and advances in technology adverse changes in the regulatory environment or other factors leading to reduction in expected longterm sales or profitability 

assets and liabilities held for sale   the company classifies assets and liabilities disposal groups to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the disposal group the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated the sale of the disposal group is probable and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year except if events or circumstances beyond the companys control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group 

  

  

beyond one year the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 

the company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met conversely gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale the company assesses the fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 

upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale the company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group if material in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet 

refer to note 19 assets and liabilities held for sale to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets   during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon consideration of other factors including recent acquisition restructuring or divestiture activity the company performs a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis in addition the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value     

during the fourth quarter of 2017 the company performed an analysis on each reporting unit for the reporting unit with restructuring activities the company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances   

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2017 goodwill quantitative step one impairment review are as follows   

  

  

 

 

 

i n addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models   

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to the reporting unit with restructuring activity that was quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained a fair value that exceeded the reporting units carrying value by more than 20 additionally for the reporting unit quantitatively assessed sensitivity analyses were completed indicating that a   one   percent increase in the discount rate a   one  percent decrease in the operating margin or a one percent decrease in the revenue growth rate assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value 

refer to note 6 goodwill and other intangibles to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill 

product warranties   the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual the increase in 2016 in our warranty provision as a percentage of net sales was primarily related to the companys fourth quarter 2015 acquisition of remy 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



  

  

at december 31 2017 the total accrued warranty liability was 1115 million  the accrual is represented as 690 million  in current liabilities and 425 million  in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

refer to note 7 product warranty to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances   the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

asbestos the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials with the assistance of third party consultants the company estimates the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims not yet asserted through december 31 2059 with a runoff through 2067 and defense costs this estimate is based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed based on anticipated levels of unique plaintiff asbestosrelated claims in the us tort system against all defendants this estimate is not discounted to present value the company currently believes that december 31 2067 is a reasonable assumption as to the last date on which it is likely to have resolved all asbestosrelated claims based on the nature and useful life of the company’s products and the likelihood of incidence of asbestosrelated disease in the us population generally the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs on an ongoing basis by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company continues to have additional excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated claims in connection with the company’s ongoing review of its asbestosrelated claims the company also reviewed the amount of its potential insurance coverage for such claims taking into account the remaining limits of such coverage the number and amount of claims on our insurance from coinsured parties ongoing litigation against the company’s insurers potential remaining recoveries from insolvent insurers the impact of previous insurance settlements and coverage available from solvent insurers not party to the coverage litigation 

refer to note 14 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

environmental contingencies  the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range managements estimate of the loss for environmental liability was 83 million  at december 31 2017

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined 

  

  

benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11 retirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2017 are as follows 

 

actual returns on us pension assets were 115 59 and 01 for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 601 for the same years ended 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 97 220 and 10 for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 600 for the same years ended 

actual returns on german pension assets were 70 86 and 51 for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 59 for the same years ended 

 



  

  

health care plans as of december 31 2017 the company used health care cost trend rates of 675  declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5  by the year 2025 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and opeb and its future expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2018 pretax pension expense 



 

 a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company’s us 2018 pretax pension expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 



the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the companys total 2018 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost

restructuring restructuring costs may occur when the company takes action to exit or significantly curtail a part of its operations or implements a reorganization that affects the nature and focus of operations a restructuring charge can consist of severance costs associated with reductions to the workforce costs to terminate an operating lease or contract professional fees and other costs incurred related to the implementation of restructuring activities 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted 

  

  

tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 740 the company’s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2017 the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the morelikelythannot loss on certain of its tax positions which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the us tax system the estimated impact of the law is based on management’s current interpretations of the act and related assumptions our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates based on regulatory developments and our further analysis of the impacts of the act in future periods our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments related to act

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

  

  

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk refer to note 10 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2017 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 997 of total debt our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 01 million 01 million and 21 million in the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the chinese renminbi the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen the mexican peso the swedish krona and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans such nonus dollar debt was 592 million and 821 million as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments the depreciation of the british pound following the united kingdoms 2016 vote to leave the european union is not expected to have a significant impact on the company since net sales from the united kingdom represent less than 2 of the companys net sales in 2017 in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2017 and 2016 the company recorded a deferred gain related to foreign currency derivatives of 16 million and 67 million respectively and deferred loss related to foreign currency derivatives of 39 million and 11 million respectively 

the foreign currency translation adjustment gain of 2365 million  for the year ended december 31 2017 and foreign currency translation adjustment loss of   1091 million  and 2605 million  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively contained within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our nonus dollar subsidiaries financial statements to the company’s reporting currency us dollar the 2017 foreign currency translation adjustment gain was primarily due to the impact of a weakening us dollar against the euro which decreased approximately 14 and increased other comprehensive income by approximately 2659 million since december 31 2016 the 2016 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar against the euro and chinese renminbi which increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 60 million and 45 million respectively the 2015 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 10 in relation to the euro between december 31 2014 and 2015 this 10 change in the euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 220 million 

  

  

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2017 the company had no forward or option commodity contracts outstanding and as of december 31 2016 the company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of 10 million outstanding

 item 1a risk factors   

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to oems 

  

                                             

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers a number of our competitors are larger than us and some competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business 

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply annual price reductions to oem customers are a permanent component of our business to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency updated product designs to reduce costs and we develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including aluminum copper nickel plastic resins steel other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop 

  

                                             

technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce these rights could adversely affect our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology it systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

a failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyberattacks or failures in thirdpartyprovided services disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our thirdparty data as a result such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including our intellectual property improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages this could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2016 approximately 17  of our us workforce was unionized we have a domestic collective bargaining agreement for one facility in new york which expires in september 2020 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

                                             

changes in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability 

  

we have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future additionally a material deterioration in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our pension expenses and reduce profitability in the future 

we also sponsor postemployment medical benefit plans in the us that are unfunded if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified this could have adverse effect on our business 

  

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving interpretations of existing environmental health and safety laws and regulations or any new such laws and regulations that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have liabilities related to environmental product warranties litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate while the company maintains insurance for certain risks the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our business 

  

                                             

we have faced and in the future expect to face substantial numbers of asbestosrelated claims the costs of resolving those claims is inherently uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have in the past been named in a significant number of lawsuits each year alleging injury related to exposure to asbestos in certain of our historical products we no longer manufacture distribute or sell products that contain asbestos and we vigorously defend against asbestosrelated claims over 80 percent of claims asserted against us in recent years have been resolved with no payment to the claimant notwithstanding these factors we project that a substantial number of asbestosrelated claims are likely to be asserted against us in the future we have estimated the indemnity and defense costs relating to the asbestosrelated claims that have been asserted against us but not yet resolved as well as those asbestosrelated claims that we estimate are likely to be asserted against us in the future our estimate of future asbestosrelated claims that may be asserted against us is based on assumptions as to the likely rates of occurrence of asbestosrelated disease in the us population in the future and the number of asbestosrelated claims asserted as a result furthermore our estimates are based on a number of assumptions derived from our historical experience in resolving asbestosrelated claims including 

 

if our actual experience as noted above in receiving and resolving asbestosrelated claims in the future differs significantly from these assumptions then our expenditures to resolve such claims may be significantly higher or lower than the estimates contained in our financial statements and if higher could have an adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows that is greater than we have estimated see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other matters  contingencies  asbestosrelated liability” 

while we have certain insurance coverage available respecting asbestosrelated claims asserted against us most of that insurance coverage is the subject of pending litigation the insurance that is at issue in the litigation is subject to various uncertainties including the assertion of defenses or the development of facts which we are not presently aware changes in the case law and future financial viability of remaining insurers this insurance coverage is additionally subject to claims from other coinsured parties we currently project that our remaining insurance coverage for current and future asbestosrelated claims will cover only a portion of the amounts that we estimate we ultimately may pay to resolve such claims the resolution of the insurance coverage litigation and the number and amount of claims on our insurance from coinsured parties may increase or decrease the amount of insurance coverage available to us for asbestosrelated claims from the estimates contained in our financial statements 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliance related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws could also adversely affect our business 

changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate or 

  

                                             

intend to operate in addition government disruptions such as government shutdowns may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the inability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 

if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially affected our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions 

we may not meet our goal because of any of the following or other factors a the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete and c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components 

we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic representation and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures the integration of companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected customer loss and business disruption including without limitation difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees customers or suppliers may be greater than expected and the retention of key employees at the acquired company may not be achieved we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

  

                                             

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe asia and the americas for 2016 approximately 75  of our consolidated net sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the periodend exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues expenses and capital expenditures the local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys foreign subsidiaries significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business additionally significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro korean won and chinese renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic political and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the chinese market evolves we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic political and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted and our cost of borrowing or the interest rate for any subsequently issued debt would likely increase 

our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions 

  

                                             

  

we have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness enhance treasury management flexibility or create an optimal legal entity structure we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders a customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2016 to ford and volkswagen constituted approximately 15  and 13  of our 2016 consolidated net sales respectively 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford fiat chrysler automobiles and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage at one or more of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage cyber attacks nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this could adversely affect our customer relations and business 

  

                                             

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advance notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of legal claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and other services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the companys business insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts 

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of fire flood or other natural disasters

outlook 

our overall outlook for 2017 is positive the company expects modest global production growth and net new businessrelated sales growth in 2017 due to rapid adoption of borgwarner products around the world this growth is expected to be partially offset by a stronger us dollar which would reduce the us dollar value of its foreign currencydenominated sales

net cash used in financing activities was 7338 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was 7366 million  for the year ended december 31 2015 and net cash used in financing activities was 2017 million  for the year ended december 31 2014 the decrease in the year ended december 31 2016 compared with the year ended december 31 2015 is primarily driven by lower debt borrowings and higher debt repayments partially offset by lower treasury stock purchases the increase in the year ended december 31 2015 compared with the year ended december 31 2014 is primarily driven by the 1 billion issuance of senior notes in march 2015 and the €500 million  issuance of senior notes in november 2015 partially offset by the decrease in notes payable treasury stock purchases and dividend payments 

the companys significant contractual obligation payments at december 31 2016 are as follows 



 

 

we believe that the combination of cash from operations cash balances available credit facilities and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth external growth debt reduction and cash conservation 

  

                                             

asbestosrelated liability 

during 2016 and 2015 the company had paid indemnity and related defense costs totaling   453 million   and   547 million  respectively these gross payments are before tax benefits and any insurance receipts indemnity and defense costs are incorporated into the companys operating cash flows and will continue to be in the future

off balance sheet arrangements 

the company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases types of operating leases include leases on facilities an airplane vehicles and certain office equipment the total expected future cash outlays for noncancelable operating lease obligations at december 31 2016 is 551 million  refer to note 16 leases and commitments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information on operating leases including future minimum payments 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits 

the companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate at december 31 2016 all legal funding requirements had been met the company contributed 197 million  193 million and 534 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the company expects to contribute a total of   15 million   to   25 million   into its defined benefit pension plans during 2017 of the   15 million   to   25 million   in projected 2017 contributions   32 million   are contractually obligated while any remaining payments would be discretionary   

the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of 1874 million  and 1783 million  at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively of these amounts 775 million  and 643 million  at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively were related to plans in germany where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due 

other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the companys us operations the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of 1199 million  and 1453 million  at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the 

  

                                             

companys environmental and asbestos liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter   

litigation 

in january 2006 borgwarner diversified transmission products inc dtp a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the thencurrent collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtps reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw which did not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of   40 million   as a result of the courts decision   

dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 287 and jim barrett and others individually and as representatives of a defendant class on february 26 2009 again seeking the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor  management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24 2009 certain retirees on behalf of themselves and others filed a mirrorimage action in the united states district court eastern district of michigan southern division on march 11 2009 for which a class has been certified during the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in indiana was dismissed while the action in michigan continued on december 5 2016 the court granted the company’s motion for summary judgment and ordered dismissal of the retirees’ complaint with prejudice no appeal was filed on behalf of the retirees and the time to file an appeal has expired   

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at   27   such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula   

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter   

  

                                             

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs and remediation alternatives the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of   63 million   and   54 million   at december 31 2016 and at december 31 2015 respectively the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years   

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation “kuhlman electric” the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the companys 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric the company previously settled or obtained dismissals of various lawsuits that were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant the company filed a lawsuit against kuhlman electric and a related entity challenging the validity of the indemnity and the defendants filed counterclaims the “indemnity action” and a related lawsuit on september 28 2015 the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement that among other things released and terminated all of borgwarner’s indemnity obligations pursuant to the settlement agreement the parties voluntarily dismissed the indemnity action on september 29 2015 and the related lawsuit was dismissed on october 13 2015 the company continues to pursue insurance coverage actions for reimbursement of amounts it spent under the indemnity the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings   

asbestosrelated liability 

like many other industrial companies that have historically operated in the united states the company or parties that the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the company’s involvement is limited because these claims generally relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured over   30   years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation of the asbestos and the manner of the products’ use all lead the company to believe that these products were and are highly unlikely to cause harm furthermore the useful life of nearly all of these products expired many years ago 

as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the company had approximately   9400   and 10100   pending asbestosrelated claims respectively the decrease in the number of pending claims is primarily a result of the company’s continued efforts to obtain dismissal of dormant claims it is probable that additional asbestosrelated claims will be asserted against the company in the future the company vigorously defends against these claims and has been successful in obtaining the dismissal of the majority of the claims asserted against it without any payment the company likewise expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated claims in which it has been named or has an obligation to indemnify a party which has been named and asbestosrelated claims that may be asserted in the future will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in 2016 of the approximately   2800  claims resolved 

352    13  resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in 2015 of the approximately   5300   claims resolved   349     7  resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company the comparatively large number of claims resolved in 2015 reflected the company’s efforts to dismiss large numbers of inactive or otherwise unmeritorious claims in order to be better positioned to evaluate remaining and future claims while the smaller number of total claims resolved in 2016 reflects in part the outcome of those efforts 

through december 31 2016 and 2015 the company had accrued and paid   4777 million   and   4327 million   in indemnity including settlement payments and defense costs in connection with asbestosrelated claims respectively   during 2016 and 2015 the company had paid indemnity and related defense costs totaling   453 million   and   547 million  respectively these gross payments are before tax benefits and 

  

                                             

any insurance receipts indemnity and defense costs are incorporated into the companys operating cash flows and will continue to be in the future   

the company reviews on an ongoing basis its own experience in handling asbestosrelated claims and trends affecting asbestosrelated claims in the us tort system generally for the purposes of assessing the value of pending asbestosrelated claims and the number and value of those that may be asserted in the future as well as potential recoveries from the company’s insurers with respect to such claims and defense costs as of december 31 2015 the company also recorded an estimated liability of 1085 million   for asbestosrelated claims asserted but not yet resolved and their associated defense costs the company further stated that as of that date its ultimate liability could not be reasonably estimated in excess of the amounts it had then accrued for claims that had been resolved and the estimated liability for claims asserted but not yet resolved and their associated defense costs the inability to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the liability for potential asbestosrelated claims that may be asserted in the future was based on among other factors the volatility in the number and type of asbestos claims that may be asserted changes in asbestosrelated litigation in the united states the significant number of codefendants that have filed for bankruptcy the magnitude and timing of codefendant bankruptcy trust payments the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns against the company and the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 

  

the company has continued efforts to evaluate these factors and if possible arrive at a reasonable estimate of the number and value of potential future asbestosrelated claims in recent years there have been more observable trends in the company’s claims data that would indicate that claiming patterns against the company have stabilized concurrently in recent years the company has made enhancements to the management and analysis of asbestosrelated claims including specifically the engagement of new national coordinating counsel with significant asbestos litigation experience and a global presence the engagement of several new local counsel panels outsourcing administration and claims handling to a third party implementing various improvements in the processing of asbestosrelated claims so as to allow the company’s management to have greater realtime insight into the handling of individual asbestosrelated claims and increasing audits and compliance reviews of counsel handling asbestosrelated claims this process has as of the end of 2016 resulted in improvements in both the quantity and the quality of the information available to the company’s management respecting individual asbestosrelated claims and their handling and disposition this process has also resulted in the company’s view in an increased ability to reasonably forecast the aggregate number of potential future asbestosrelated claims that may be asserted against the company 

the company has further engaged in a sustained effort to obtain the dismissal of thousands of dormant asbestosrelated product liability claims which has resulted in a reduction in the number of its pending claims by 48 percent   over the past few years legislative and judicial developments affecting the us tort system generally including medical criteria legislation procedural reforms and docket control measures relating to socalled unimpaired claims have also stabilized certain aspects of the company’s defense efforts respecting asbestosrelated claims and allowed the company greater insight into the number and value of potential future claims in recent years 

as part of its review and assessment of asbestosrelated claims the company hired a third party consultant in the third quarter of 2016 to further assist in the analysis of potential future asbestosrelated claims the consultant’s work utilized the updated data and analysis resulting from the company’s claim review process and included the development of an estimate of the potential value of asbestosrelated claims asserted but not yet resolved as well as the number and potential value of asbestosrelated claims not yet asserted the company determined based on the factors described above including the analysis and input of the consultant that its best estimate of the aggregate liability both for asbestosrelated claims asserted but not yet resolved and potential asbestosrelated claims not yet asserted including an estimate for defense costs is   8793 million   as of december 31 2016 this liability reflects the actuarial central estimate which is intended to represent an expected value of the most probable outcome this estimate 

  

                                             

is not discounted to present value and includes an estimate of liability for potential future claims not yet asserted through december 31 2059 with a runoff through 2067 the company currently believes that december 31 2067 is a reasonable assumption as to the last date on which it is likely to have resolved all asbestosrelated claims based on the nature and useful life of the company’s products and the likelihood of incidence of asbestosrelated disease in the us population generally 

in developing the estimate of liability for potential future claims the thirdparty consultant projected a potential number of future claims based on the company’s historical claim filings and patterns and compared that to anticipated levels of unique plaintiff asbestosrelated claims asserted in the us tort system against all defendants the consultant also utilized assumptions based on the company’s historical proportion of claims resolved without payment historical settlement costs for those claims that result in a payment and historical defense costs the liabilities were then estimated by multiplying the pending and projected future claim filings by projected payments rates and average settlement amounts and then adding an estimate for defense costs    

the company’s estimate of the indemnity and defense costs for asbestosrelated claims asserted but not yet resolved and potential claims not yet asserted is its best estimate of such costs that estimate is subject to numerous uncertainties these include future legislative or judicial changes affecting the us tort system bankruptcy proceedings involving one or more codefendants the impact and timing of payments from bankruptcy trusts that presently exist and those that may exist in the future disease emergence and associated claim filings the impact of future settlements or significant judgments changes in the medical condition of claimants changes in the treatment of asbestosrelated disease and any changes in settlement or defense strategies the amount recorded at december 31 2016 for asbestosrelated claims is based on currently available information and assumptions that the company believes are reasonable any amounts that are reasonably possible of occurring in excess of amounts recorded are believed to not be significant the various assumptions utilized in arriving at the company’s estimate the number of future claims that may be asserted the percentage of claims that may result in a payment the average cost to resolve such claims and potential defense costs  may also change over time and the company’s actual liability for asbestosrelated claims asserted but not yet resolved and those not yet asserted may be higher or lower than the estimate provided herein as a result of such changes 

the company has certain insurance coverage applicable to asbestosrelated claims prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all asbestosrelated claims were paid by the companys primary layer insurance carriers under a series of interim funding arrangements in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies against the company and certain of its historical general liability insurers the cook county court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing in this proceeding the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against all carriers that are parties to it as well as pursuing settlement discussions with its carriers where appropriate the company has entered into settlement agreements with certain of its insurance carriers resolving such insurance carriers’ coverage disputes through the carriers’ agreement to pay specified amounts to the company either immediately or over a specified period 

through december 31 2016 and 2015 the company had received 2700 million   and   2639 million     in cash and notes from insurers respectively on account of indemnity and defense costs respecting asbestosrelated claims the company additionally recorded assets as of december 31 2015 in the amount of i   1688 million    representing the difference between the   4327 million   in defense and indemnity costs paid by the company as of december 31 2015 for asbestosrelated claims and the 2639 million    received from insurers prior to that date and ii   1085 million  representing the thenestimated amount of asbestosrelated claims asserted but not yet resolved for which the company believes it has insurance coverage in each case such amounts were expected to be fully recovered   

  

                                             

the company continues to have additional excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated claims in connection with the company’s ongoing review of its asbestosrelated claims the company also reviewed the amount of its potential insurance coverage for such claims taking into account the remaining limits of such coverage the number and amount of claims on our insurance from coinsured parties ongoing litigation against the company’s insurers described above potential remaining recoveries from insolvent insurers the impact of previous insurance settlements and coverage available from solvent insurers not party to the coverage litigation based on that review the company estimates as of december 31 2016 that it has 3864 million   in aggregate insurance coverage available with respect to asbestosrelated claims already satisfied by the company but not yet reimbursed by the insurers asbestosrelated claims asserted but not yet resolved and asbestosrelated claims not yet asserted in each case together with their associated defense costs in each case such amounts are expected to be fully recovered however the resolution of the insurance coverage litigation and the number and amount of claims on our insurance from coinsured parties may increase or decrease the amount of insurance coverage available to us for asbestosrelated claims from the estimates discussed above 

  as a result of all of the foregoing estimates of asbestosrelated liabilities and related insurance assets the company in the fourth quarter of 2016 recorded a charge of   7036 million  before tax or   4406 million   after tax resulting from the difference in the total liability from what was previously accrued consulting fees less available insurance coverage 

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets respecting asbestosrelated claims are as follows 



critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

                                             

concentration of risk the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers and customers and with the exception of certain financing transactions does not require collateral from its oem customers some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity these factors have increased pressure on the industrys supply base as suppliers cope with changing commodity costs lower production volumes and other challenges the company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers the inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future operating results 

revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

cost of sales   the company includes materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials indirect labor factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale 

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic 360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations longlived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our longlived assets include changes in the industries in which we operate particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy as well as competition and advances in technology adverse changes in the regulatory environment or other factors leading to reduction in expected longterm sales or profitability 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets   during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon consideration of other factors including recent acquisition or divestiture activity the company performs a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis in addition the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value     

  

                                             

during the fourth quarter of 2016 the company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit except for the reporting unit with recent acquisition and divestiture activities and determined it was morelikelythannot the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units for the reporting unit with acquisition and divestiture activities the company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances   

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2016 goodwill quantitative step one impairment review are as follows   

 

 

i n addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models   

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to the reporting unit that was quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained a fair value substantially higher than the reporting units carrying value additionally sensitivity analyses were completed indicating a   one   percent increase in the discount rate or a   one   percent decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of the reporting unit quantitatively assessed

product warranties   the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual our warranty provision as a percentage of net sales in 2016 increased is primarily related to the companys fourth quarter 2015 acquisition of remy 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2016 the total accrued warranty liability was 953 million  the accrual is represented as 639 million  in current liabilities and 314 million  in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

refer to note 7 product warranty to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances   the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

asbestos the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials with the assistance of third party consultants the company estimates the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims not yet asserted through december 31 2059 with a runoff through 2067 and defense costs this estimate is based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed based on anticipated levels of unique plaintiff asbestosrelated claims in the us tort system against all defendants this estimate is not discounted to present value the company currently believes that december 31 2067 is a reasonable assumption as to the last date on which it is likely to have resolved all asbestosrelated claims based on the nature and useful life of the company’s products and the likelihood of incidence of asbestosrelated disease in the us population generally the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs on an ongoing basis by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy 

  

                                             

the company continues to have additional excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated claims in connection with the company’s ongoing review of its asbestosrelated claims the company also reviewed the amount of its potential insurance coverage for such claims taking into account the remaining limits of such coverage the number and amount of claims on our insurance from coinsured parties ongoing litigation against the company’s insurers potential remaining recoveries from insolvent insurers the impact of previous insurance settlements and coverage available from solvent insurers not party to the coverage litigation

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11 retirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2016 are as follows 



  

                                             

actual returns on us pension assets were 59 01 and 103 for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 67 for the same years ended 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 220 10 and 165 for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the same years ended 

actual returns on german pension assets were 86 51 and 145 for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 66 for the same years ended 

 

the discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations “opeb” the company used discount rates ranging from 033 to 950 to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december 31 2016 including weighted average discount rates of 394 in the us 225 outside of the us and 361 for us other postretirement health care plans the us discount rate reflects the fact that our us pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 1999 for our us health care plan 

 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2017 pretax pension expense 



 

  

                                             

 a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company’s us 2017 pretax pension expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 



the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the companys total 2017 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk refer to note 10 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity purchase price risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2016 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 985 of total debt our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 01 million 21 million and 02 million in the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the chinese renminbi the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen the mexican peso the swedish krona and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans such nonus dollar debt was 821 million and 1446 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments the depreciation of the british pound post the united kingdoms 2016 vote to leave the european union is not expected to have a significant impact on the company since net sales from the united kingdom represents less than 2 of the companys net sales in 2016 in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the company recorded a shortterm deferred gain related to foreign currency derivatives of 67 million and 24 million respectively and shortterm deferred loss related to foreign currency derivatives of 11 million and 25 million respectively 

the foreign currency translation adjustment losses of 1091 million  2605 million  and 3418 million  for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively contained within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our nonus dollar subsidiaries financial statements to the company’s reporting currency us dollar the 2016 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening 

  

                                             

us dollar against the euro and chinese renminbi which increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 60 million and 45 million respectively the 2015 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 10 in relation to the euro between december 31 2014 and 2015 this 10 change in the euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 220 million the 2014 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 12 in relation to the euro between december 31 2013 and 2014 this 12 change in the euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 243 million 

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of 10 million and 388 million respectively as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the company recorded a shortterm deferred loss related to commodity derivatives of 01 million and 21 million respectively

sales and marketing 

each of the companys businesses within its two reporting segments has its own sales function account executives for each of our businesses are assigned to serve specific customers for one or more of a businesses products our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with customers purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with customers account executives are able to identify and meet customers needs based upon their knowledge of our products design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers in addition sales and marketing employees of our engine and drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore crossdevelopment opportunities where appropriate 

seasonality 

our operations are directly related to the automotive industry consequently we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations historically model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter 

research and development 

the company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at the reporting segment level this advanced engineering function looks to leverage knowhow and expertise across product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized this function manages a venture capital fund that was created by the company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses

 item 1a risk factors   

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to oems 

  

    

    

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business 

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply annual price reductions to oem customers are a permanent component of our business to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency updated product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including aluminum copper nickel plastic resins steel other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop 

  

    

    

technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce these rights could adversely affect our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

a failure of our information technology it infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyberattacks or failures in thirdpartyprovided services disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our thirdparty data as a result such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including our intellectual property improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages this could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 16  of our us workforce was unionized we have domestic collective bargaining agreements for one facility in new york which expires in september 2016 and one facility in oklahoma which expires in march 2019 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded 

we sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments if the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified our required cash payments may be higher than we expect   

  

    

    

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have liabilities related to environmental product warranties litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability including claims associated with the presence of asbestos in historical products environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate while the company maintains insurance for certain risks the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities the incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our business 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliance related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws could also adversely affect our business 

changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate in addition government disruptions such as government shutdowns may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business 

  

    

    

changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 

if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially affected our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions 

we may not meet our goal because of any of the following or other factors a the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete and c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components 

we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic representation and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures the integration of companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected customer loss and business disruption including without limitation difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees customers or suppliers may be greater than expected and the retention of key employees at the acquired company may not be achieved we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

  

    

    

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including europe asia the americas and africa for 2015 approximately 75  of our consolidated net sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the periodend exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues expenses and capital expenditures the local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys foreign subsidiaries significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic political and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the chinese market evolves we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic political and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted 

our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions 

  

we have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness enhance treasury management flexibility or create an optimal legal entity structure we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

    

    

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders a customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2015 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 15  each of our 2015 consolidated net sales 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford fiat chrysler automobiles and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage cyber attacks nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this could adversely affect our customer relations and business 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advanced notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

  

    

    

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of legal claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and other services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the companys business insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts 

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of fire flood or other natural disasters

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 7366 million  for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily driven by the 1 billion issuance of senior notes in march 2015 and the €500 million  issuance of senior notes in november 2015 partially offset by the decrease in notes payable treasury stock purchases and dividend payments net cash used in financing activities was 2017 million  and 1354 million  for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the 663 million increase in the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily driven by lower net borrowings in 2014 and higher dividends paid to borgwarner stockholders partially offset by higher payments for the purchase of treasury stock in 2013

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter   

litigation 

in january 2006 borgwarner diversified transmission products inc dtp a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the thencurrent collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtps reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained 

  

    

    

health insurance agreement with the uaw which did not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of   40 million   as a result of the courts decision   

dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 287 and jim barrett and others individually and as representatives of a defendant class on february 26 2009 again seeking the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor  management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24 2009 certain retirees on behalf of themselves and others filed a mirrorimage action in the united states district court eastern district of michigan southern division on march 11 2009 for which a class has been certified during the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in indiana was dismissed while the action in michigan is continuing the company is vigorously defending against the suit this contingency is subject to many uncertainties therefore based on the information available to date the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss if any   

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at   26   such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula   

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter   

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs and remediation alternatives the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of   54 million   and   62 million   at december 31 2015 and at december 31 2014 respectively the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years   

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation “kuhlman electric” the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the companys 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric the company previously settled or obtained dismissals of various lawsuits that were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant the company filed a lawsuit against kuhlman electric and a related entity challenging the validity of the indemnity and the defendants filed counterclaims the “indemnity action” and a related lawsuit on september 28 2015 the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement that among other things released and terminated all of borgwarner’s indemnity obligations pursuant to the settlement agreement the parties voluntarily dismissed the indemnity action on september 29 2015 and the related lawsuit was dismissed on october 13 2015 the company continues to pursue insurance coverage actions for reimbursement of amounts it spent under the indemnity the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings   

  

    

    

product liability 

like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the companys involvement is limited because in general these claims relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the company had approximately   10100   and   13300   pending asbestosrelated product liability claims respectively the decrease in the pending claims is primarily a result of the companys continued efforts to obtain dismissal of dormant claims   

the companys policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment the nature of the historical product being encapsulated and the lifecycle of the product allow the company to aggressively defend against these lawsuits the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in the full year of 2015 of the approximately   5300   claims resolved   349   7   resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in the full year of 2014 of the approximately   6500   claims resolved   397   6   resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company   

prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the companys primary layer insurance carriers under a series of interim funding arrangements in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestosrelated claims the company has excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated product claims in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits   

a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies against the company and certain of its historical general liability insurers the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing the company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the company this includes a settlement with a carrier that occurred in the third quarter of 2015 the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers   

in august 2013 the los angeles superior court entered a jury verdict against the company in an asbestosrelated personal injury action with damages of   350 million  of which   325 million  were punitive and would not be recoverable through insurance in july 2015 the court of appeal for the state of california issued a decision striking the   325 million   in punitive damages the plaintiffs sought to reinstate the punitive damages by petitioning for review from the california supreme court in october 2015 the california supreme court denied plaintiffs petition for review in december 2015 the company satisfied the amended judgment in full with respect to compensatory damages only and received the acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment from the los angeles superior court this decision did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements     

  

to date the company has paid and accrued   3917 million   in defense and indemnity costs in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received   2284 million   in cash and notes from insurers the net balance of   1633 million   is expected to be fully recovered timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements at december 31 2014 insurers owed   1419 million   in association with these claims   

  

    

    

in addition to the 1633 million   net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs the company has estimated a liability of   1085 million   for claims asserted but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december 31 2015 the company also has a related asset of 1085 million   to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers which is expected to be fully recovered receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above which is expected to occur subsequent to december 31 2016   at december 31 2014 the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was   1118 million  

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows   



the company believes that its ultimate liability ie the total of its indemnity or other claim dispositions plus legal related fees cannot be reasonably estimated at this time in excess of amounts accrued the companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by among other factors the volatility of asbestosrelated litigation in the united states the significant number of codefendants that have filed for bankruptcy the magnitude and timing of codefendant bankruptcy trust payments the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns against the company and the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels the company’s ability to reasonably estimate its liability for asbestosrelated claims may also be affected in the future by the new discovery of facts changes in litigation the impact of any possible tort reform changes in assumptions regarding the number and nature of asbestosrelated claims including the total population claiming exposure the amounts of any judgments over time and changes in settlementdefense strategies the company reviews factors relevant to asbestosrelated claims that have been or may in the future be asserted against it on an ongoing basis   

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

    

    

concentration of risk the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers and customers and with the exception of certain financing transactions does not require collateral from its oem customers some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity these factors have increased pressure on the industrys supply base as suppliers cope with changing commodity costs lower production volumes and other challenges the company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers the inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future operating results 

revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

cost of sales  the company includes materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials indirect labor factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale 

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic 360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations longlived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets   during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon consideration of other factors including recent acquisition or divestiture activity the company performs a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis in addition the company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value     

during the fourth quarter of 2015 and prior to the remy acquisition the company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit except for reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities 

  

    

    

and determined it was morelikelythannot the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units for the reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities the company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of these goodwill impairment analyses is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances   

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2015 goodwill quantitative step one impairment reviews are as follows   

 

 

i n addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models   

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to these reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained fair values substantially higher than the reporting units carrying values additionally sensitivity analyses were completed indicating a   one   percent increase in the discount rate or a   one   percent decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying values exceeding the fair values of the reporting units quantitatively assessed

product warranties   the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual our warranty provision over the last three years and as a percentage of net sales has stabilized based on the companys improved quality efforts and has trended as follows 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2015 the total accrued warranty liability was 1079 million  the accrual is represented as 706 million  in current liabilities and 373 million  in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

refer to note 7 product warranty to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances   the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

environmental contingencies  the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range managements estimate of the loss for environmental liability was 54 million  at december 31 2015 

refer to note 14 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding environmental accrual 

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

  

    

    

the companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11 retirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2015 are as follows 

 

actual returns on us pension assets were 01 103 and 83 for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the same years ended 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 10 165 and 128 for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the same years ended 

actual return on german pension assets was 51 and 145 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 66 for the same years ended 

 

the discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations “opeb” the company used discount rates ranging from 050 to 875 to determine its pension and other 

  

    

    

benefit obligations as of december 31 2015 including weighted average discount rates of 415 in the us 299 outside of the us and 384 for us other postretirement health care plans the us discount rate reflects the fact that our us pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 1999 for our us health care plan 

 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2016 pretax pension expense 



 

 a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company’s us 2016 pretax pension expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 



the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the companys total 2016 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between 

  

    

    

financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 605 the company’s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2015 the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the morelikelythannot loss on certain of its tax positions which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk refer to note 10 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2015 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 811 of total debt including the impact of the interest rate swaps our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 21 million 02 million and 17 million in the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the chinese yuan the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen the mexican peso the swedish krona and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans such nonus dollar debt was 1446 million and 1296 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as a result of the remy acquisition the company acquired foreign exchange forward contracts with market values reflecting a cumulative loss of 75 million  these contracts were assumed by the company at fair market value and designated as hedges of future cash flows as of december 31 2015 the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 24 million and 25 million respectively all of which mature in less than one year 

the foreign currency translation adjustment losses of 2605 million  and 3418 million  for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively and the foreign currency translation adjustment income of 403 million  for the year ended december 31 2013 contained within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our nonus dollar subsidiaries financial statements to the company’s reporting currency us dollar the 2015 foreign 

  

    

    

currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 10 in relation to the euro between december 31 2014 and 2015 this 10 change in the euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 220 million the 2014 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 12 in relation to the euro between december 31 2013 and 2014 this 12 change in the euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately 243 million the 2013 foreign currency translation adjustment income was primarily due to the impact of a weakening us dollar in relation to the euro 

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as a result of the remy acquisition the company acquired commodity derivative contracts with market values reflecting a cumulative loss of 92 million  these contracts were assumed by the company at fair market value and have been designated as hedges of future cash flows as of december 31 2015 the company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of 388 million as of december 31 2015 the company was holding commodity derivatives with a negative fair market value of 21 million of which 20 million mature in less than one year

disclosure controls and procedures 

a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected however our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives 

the company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the exchange act such as this form 10k is collected recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission the companys disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as required under exchange act rule 13a15 the companys management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective

 item 1a risk factors   

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to oems 

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business 

  

    

    

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply annual price reductions to oem customers are a permanent component of our business to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency updated product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including steel nickel copper aluminum plastic resins other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce these rights could adversely affect our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

  

    

    

a failure of our information technology it infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyberattacks or failures in thirdpartyprovided services disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our thirdparty data as a result such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including our intellectual property improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages this could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 18  of our us workforce was unionized our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our new york facility this agreement expires in september 2016 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded 

we sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments if the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified our required cash payments may be higher than we expect   

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the 2010 act was signed into law in march 2010 as the 2010 act evolves we continue to evaluate its effect including its potential impact on the future cost of our benefit plans 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

    

    

we have liabilities related to environmental product warranties litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliance related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws could also adversely affect our business 

changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate in addition government disruptions such as a us government shutdown may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business 

changes in tax laws or tax rates the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect our operating results in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 

if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially affected our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

  

    

    

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions 

we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete c and a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components 

we expect to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic representation and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be adversely affected likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including the americas europe and asia for 2014 approximately 76  of our consolidated net sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the periodend exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues expenses and capital expenditures the local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys foreign subsidiaries significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic political and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability 

  

    

    

to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic political and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted 

our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions 

  

we have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness and enhance treasury management flexibility we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our customer s 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders a customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2014 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 17  and 13  respectively of our 2014 consolidated net sales 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford chrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

    

    

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this could adversely affect our customer relations and business 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advanced notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers compensation claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the companys business insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts 

  

    

    

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of fire flood or other natural disasters

net cash used in investing activities was 6651 million  3848 million  and 3452 million  in the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily driven by the acquisition of wahler and higher capital expenditures including tooling outlays the increase in the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the year ended december 31 2012 is primarily driven by cash received in the third quarter of 2012 from the sale of the companys spark plug business year over year capital spending increases of 1452 million  and 104 million  during the years ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively were primarily due to higher spending levels required to meet increased program launches worldwide 

  

    

    

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 2017 million  1354 million  and 1886 million  for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the 663 million  increase in the year ended december 31 2014 compared with the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily driven by lower net borrowings in 2014 and higher dividends paid to borgwarner stockholders partially offset by higher payments for the purchase of treasury stock in 2013 the 532 million  decrease in the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the year ended december 31 2012 is primarily driven by an increase in net borrowings and decreased payments for treasury stock purchases partially offset by increased payments for dividends and a reduction in proceeds from stock option exercises including the tax benefit 

the companys significant contractual obligation payments at december 31 2014 are as follows 



 

 

we believe that the combination of cash from operations cash balances available credit facilities and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth external growth debt reduction and cash conservation 

off balance sheet arrangements 

the company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases types of operating leases include leases on facilities an airplane vehicles and certain office equipment the total expected future cash outlays for noncancelable operating lease obligations at december 31 2014 is 696 million  refer to note 16 leases and commitments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information on operating leases including future minimum payments 

  

    

    

pension and other postretirement employee benefits 

the companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate at december 31 2014 all legal funding requirements had been met the company contributed 534 million  1504 million and 180 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the company expects to contribute a total of   15 million   to   25 million   into its defined benefit pension plans during 2015 of the   15 million   to   25 million   in projected 2015 contributions   99 million   are contractually obligated while any remaining payments would be discretionary   

the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of 1728 million  and 1572 million  at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively of these amounts 765 million  and 686 million  at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively were related to plans in germany where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due in december 2014 and 2013 the company made discretionary contributions of 302 million  and 1375 million  respectively to its german pension plans 

other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the companys us operations the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of 1697 million  and 1775 million  at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future 

refer to note 11 retirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 

  

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter   

litigation 

in january 2006 borgwarner diversified transmission products inc dtp a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the thencurrent collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtps reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained 

  

    

    

health insurance agreement with the uaw which did not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of   40 million   as a result of the courts decision   

dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 287 and jim barrett and others individually and as representatives of a defendant class on february 26 2009 again seeking the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor  management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24 2009 certain retirees on behalf of themselves and others filed a mirrorimage action in the united states district court eastern district of michigan southern division on march 11 2009 for which a class has been certified during the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in indiana was dismissed while the action in michigan is continuing the company is vigorously defending against the suit this contingency is subject to many uncertainties therefore based on the information available to date the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss if any   

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at   27   such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula   

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter   

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs and remediation alternatives the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of   62 million   and   40 million   at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years   

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation “kuhlman electric” the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the companys 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric the company previously settled or obtained dismissals of various lawsuits that were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant the company filed a lawsuit against kuhlman electric and a related entity challenging the validity of the indemnity and the defendants filed counterclaims and a related lawsuit in addition two lawsuits by plaintiffs alleging environmental contamination relating to kuhlman electrics crystal springs plant are still pending and the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings   

  

    

    

product liability 

like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the companys involvement is limited because in general these claims relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the company had approximately   13300   and   17000   pending asbestosrelated product liability claims respectively   the decrease in the pending claims is a result of legislation passed in 2013 in texas where claims against the company have been dismissed   

the companys policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in 2014 of the approximately   6500   claims resolved   397   6  resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in the full year of 2013 of the approximately   1500   claims resolved   297   20  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company   

prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the companys primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestosrelated claims the company has excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated product claims in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits   

a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies against the company and certain of its historical general liability insurers the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing the company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the company this includes a settlement in cash and short and longterm notes with a carrier in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers   

in august 2013 the los angeles superior court entered a jury verdict against the company in an asbestosrelated personal injury action with damages of   350 million    325 million   of which was noncompensatory and will not be recoverable through insurance if the verdict is upheld the company has appealed the verdict the company posted a surety bond of 550 million  related to the appeal the company cannot predict the outcome of this pending litigation and therefore cannot reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss if any that could result from this action   

the companys estimate of asbestosrelated liabilities is subject to uncertainty because liabilities are influenced by numerous variables that are inherently difficult to predict key variables include the number and type of new claims the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms that may be made by state and federal courts and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation the nature of the historical product being encapsulated and the lifecycle of the product allow the company to aggressively defend against these lawsuits and at present management does not believe that asbestosrelated product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows   

to date the company has paid and accrued   3378 million  in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received   1959 million   in cash and notes from insurers the net balance of   1419 million  is expected to be fully recovered timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of 

  

    

    

the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements at december 31 2013 insurers owed   1536 million   in association with these claims   

in addition to the   1419 million   net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs the company has estimated a liability of   1118 million  f or claims asserted but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december 31 2014 the company also has a related asset of   1118 million   to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers which is expected to be fully recovered receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above which is expected to occur subsequent to december 31 2015 at december 31 2013 the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was   967 million  

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows   



the 2014 increase in the accrued liability and associated insurance asset is primarily due to an expected higher rate of claim settlement based on recent claim activity   

the company does not believe that it can at present reasonably estimate possible losses in excess of those for which it has accrued the companys belief is based on a number of factors including without limitation because the company cannot reasonably predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future the particular illnesses or medical conditions that may be alleged in such claims the allegations in such claims and the evidence submitted by claimants in support thereof the possible outcomes in settling or litigating such claims the time in which claims will proceed through courts in which they are asserted or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels the company reviews factors relevant to the asbestos claims that have been or may in the future be asserted against it on an ongoing basis 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during 

  

    

    

the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

concentration of risk the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers and customers and with the exception of certain financing transactions does not require collateral from its oem customers some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity these factors have increased pressure on the industrys supply base as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs lower production volumes and other challenges the company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers the inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future operating results 

revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

cost of sales  the company includes materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials indirect labor factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale 

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic 360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations longlived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets   during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon a triggering event including recent acquisition or divestiture activity the company performs a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis   

during the fourth quarter of 2014 the company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit except for reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities and determined it was more 

  

    

    

likelythannot the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units for the reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities the company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of these goodwill impairment analyses is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances   

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2014 goodwill quantitative step one impairment reviews are as follows   

 

 

i n addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models   

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2014 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to these reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained fair values substantially higher than the reporting units carrying values additionally sensitivity analyses were completed indicating a   one   percent increase in the discount rate or a   one   percent decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying values exceeding the fair values of the reporting units quantitatively assessed   

refer to note 6 goodwill and other intangibles to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill 

product warranties   the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual our warranty provision over the last three years and as a percentage of net sales has stabilized based on the companys improved quality efforts and has trended as follows 

  

    

    



the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2014 the total accrued warranty liability was 1320 million  the accrual is represented as 919 million  in current liabilities and 401 million  in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

refer to note 7 product warranty to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances   the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

environmental contingencies  the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range managements estimate of the loss for environmental liability was 62 million  at december 31 2014 

refer to note 14 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding environmental accrual 

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11 retirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

  

    

    

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2014 are as follows 

 

actual returns on us pension assets were 103 83 and 110 for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the same years ended 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 165 128 and 100 for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the same years ended 

actual return on german pension assets was 145 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 60 for the same year ended 

 

 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 

  

    

    

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2015 pretax pension expense 



 

 a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company’s us 2015 pretax pension expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 



the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the companys total 2015 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost 



refer to note 11 retirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding the company’s retirement benefit plans 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

  

    

    

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 605 the company’s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2014 the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the morelikelythannot loss on certain of its tax positions which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

refer to note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information regarding income taxes 

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board amended the accounting standards codification to add topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseding most current revenue recognition guidance this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements   

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk refer to note 10 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2014 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 897 of total debt our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 02 million 17 million and 16 million in the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

    

    

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the chinese yuan the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen the mexican peso the swedish krona and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans such nonus dollar debt was 1296 million and 2823 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2014 the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 38 million and 29 million respectively of which 37 million in assets and 24 million in liabilities mature in less than one year 

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2014 the company had no forward and option commodity contracts outstanding

report of management on internal control over financial reporting 

the information in this report is the responsibility of management borgwarner inc and consolidated subsidiaries the “company” has in place reporting guidelines and policies designed to ensure that the statements and other information contained in this report present a fair and accurate financial picture of the company in fulfilling this management responsibility we make informed judgments and estimates conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 

the companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america the internal control process includes those policies and procedures that 

 

 

 

any system of internal control no matter how well designed has inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 in making this assessment the companys management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control  integrated framework 2013

 item 1a risk factors   

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse affect on our sales to oems 

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business 

  

  

    

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply annual price reductions to oem customers have become a permanent feature of our business environment to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency updated product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face highly volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including steel nickel copper aluminum plastic resins other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases the discontinuation or lessening of our ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect these rights could materially adversely affect our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

  

  

    

a failure of our information technology it infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our it systems and infrastructure it systems are vulnerable to disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters cyberattacks or failures in thirdpartyprovided services disruptions and attacks on our it systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and customers’ data as a result such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information including our intellectual property improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages this could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers lead to claims against the company and ultimately adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 20 of our us workforce was unionized our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our new york facility this agreement expires in september 2016 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded 

we sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments if the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified our required cash payments may be higher than we expect   

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the act was signed into law in march 2010 we continue to evaluate the effect of the act including its potential impact on the future cost of our benefit plans 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

  

    

we have liabilities related to environmental product warranties regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions which are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits or changes to tax laws governing the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and d the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including the americas europe and asia for 2013 approximately 74  of our sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging burdensome and expensive 

  

  

    

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted 

our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to any of a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders the customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2013 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 16  and 14  respectively of our 2013 consolidated net sales 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford chrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse affect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this would adversely affect our customer relations and business 

  

  

    

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advanced notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers compensation claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the companys business insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of natural disasters

capitalization 



balance sheet debt increased by 1554 million  and cash increased by 2238 million  compared with december 31 2012 the 684 million  decrease in balance sheet debt net of cash was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities partially offset by capital expenditures share repurchases and dividends paid to stockholders 

total equity increased by 4863 million  in the year ended december 31 2013 as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 7188 million  8787 million  and 7082 million  in the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease for the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the year ended december 31 2012 primarily reflects working capital changes partially offset by higher net earnings the change in working capital is primarily driven by the 1375 million  discretionary pension contribution made to the companys german pension plans and an increased accounts receivable balance the increase in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 primarily reflects improved working capital management 

  

  

    

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 3848 million  3452 million  and 5645 million  in the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the year ended december 31 2012 is primarily driven by cash received in the third quarter of 2012 from the sale of the companys spark plug business the decrease in cash used in investing activities in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 primarily reflects the cash payment of 2037 million made during the first quarter of 2011 for the acquisition of haldex traction ab and the cash proceeds of 552 million received during the third quarter of 2012 from the sale of the spark plug business which was partially offset by increased capital expenditures year over year capital spending increases of 104 million  and 137 million  during the years ended december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively were primarily due to higher spending levels required to meet increased program launches worldwide 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 1354 million  1886 million  and 2197 million  for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 532 million  decrease in the year ended december 31 2013 compared with the year ended december 31 2012 is primarily driven by an increase in net borrowings and decreased payments for treasury stock purchases partially offset by increased payments for dividends and a reduction in proceeds from stock option exercises including the tax benefit 

the 311 million  decrease during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily driven by decreased purchases of treasury stock partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to noncontrolling stockholders 

the companys significant contractual obligation payments at december 31 2013 are as follows 



 

 

  

  

    

we believe that the combination of cash from operations cash balances available credit facilities and the anticipated shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth external growth debt reduction and cash conservation 

off balance sheet arrangements 

the company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases types of operating leases include leases on the headquarters facility an airplane vehicles and certain office equipment the total expected future cash outlays for noncancelable operating lease obligations at december 31 2013 is 552 million  see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on operating leases including future minimum payments 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits 

the companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate at december 31 2013 all legal funding requirements had been met the company contributed 1504 million  180 million and 370 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the company expects to contribute a total of 15 million  to 25 million  into its defined benefit pension plans during 2014 of the 15 million  to 25 million  in projected 2014 contributions 28 million  are contractual obligations while any remaining payments would be discretionary 

the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of 1572 million  and 3171 million  at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively of these amounts 686 million  and 1924 million  at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively were related to plans in germany where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due in december 2013 the company made a discretionary contribution of 1375 million to its german pension plans 

other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the companys us operations the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of 1775 million  and 2205 million  at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations 

  

  

    

financial position or cash flows although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter 

litigation 

in january 2006 borgwarner diversified transmission products inc dtp a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the thencurrent collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtps reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw which did not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of 40 million  as a result of the courts decision 

dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 287 and jim barrett and others individually and as representatives of a defendant class on february 26 2009 again seeking the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor  management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24 2009 certain retirees on behalf of themselves and others filed a mirrorimage action in the united states district court eastern district of michigan southern division on march 11 2009 for which a class has been certified during the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in indiana was dismissed while the action in michigan is continuing the company is vigorously defending against the suit this contingency is subject to many uncertainties therefore based on the information available to date the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss if any a decision on the merits of the suit could be rendered sometime in 2014 

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 32  such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs and remediation alternatives the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of 40 million  and 39 million  at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years 

  

  

    

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation kuhlman electric the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the companys 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric in 2007 and 2008 lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 340  plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant the company entered into a settlement in july 2010 regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs and those of approximately 2700  unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs attorneys in exchange for among other things the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants the company agreed to pay up to 28 million  in settlement funds which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010 the company paid 139 million  in november 2010 and made the final payment of 139 million  in february 2011 litigation concerning indemnification is pending and the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings 

product liability 

like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the companys involvement is limited because in general these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the company had approximately 17000   and 16000  pending asbestosrelated product liability claims respectively of the approximately 17000  outstanding claims at december 31 2013 approximately half were pending in jurisdictions that have undergone significant tort and judicial reform activities subsequent to the filing of these claims 

the companys policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in 2013 of the approximately 1500  claims resolved 297   20  resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in the full year of 2012 of the approximately 2400  claims resolved 308   13  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 

prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the companys primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestosrelated claims the company has substantial excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated product claims in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits 

a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies against the company and certain of its historical general liability insurers the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing the company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the company the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers 

in august 2013 the los angeles superior court entered a jury verdict against the company in an asbestosrelated personal injury action with damages of 350 million  325 million  of which was noncompensatory and will not be recoverable through insurance if the verdict is upheld the company has appealed the verdict the company posted a surety bond of 550 million  related to the appeal the company 

  

  

    

cannot predict the outcome of this pending litigation and therefore cannot reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss if any that could result from this action 

although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels due to the encapsulated nature of the products the companys experience in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past and the companys significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing management does not believe that asbestosrelated product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows 

to date the company has paid and accrued 2784 million  in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received 1248 million  in cash and notes from insurers the net balance of 1536 million  is expected to be fully recovered of which approximately 20 million  is expected to be recovered within one year timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements at december 31 2012 insurers owed 1110 million  in association with these claims 

in addition to the 1536 million  net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs the company has estimated a liability of 967 million  for claims asserted but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december 31 2013 the company also has a related asset of 967 million  to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers which is expected to be fully recovered receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above which morelikelythannot will occur subsequent to december 31 2014 at december 31 2012 the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was 856 million  

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows 



the 2013 increase in the accrued liability and associated insurance asset is primarily due to an expected higher rate of claim settlement based on recent claim activity 

the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses if any in excess of those for which it has accrued because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future the allegations in such claims the possible outcomes or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal 

  

  

    

of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

cost of sales  the company includes materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials indirect labor factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale 

  

  

    

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets   the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic 360 in assessing longlived assets for an impairment loss assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in assessing longlived assets for impairment management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations longlived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythan not the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon a triggering event including recent acquisition or divestiture activity the company performs a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit and determined it was morelikelythannot the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units for the reporting unit with recent restructuring activity the company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances 

  

  

    

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine its estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2013 goodwill quantitative step one impairment review are as follows 

 

 

in addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model 

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2013 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to the reporting unit that was quantitatively assessed was not impaired additionally a sensitivity analysis was completed indicating a 1  increase in the discount rate or a 1  decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of the reporting unit quantitatively assessed 

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 

product warranties   the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual our warranty provision over the last three years and as a percentage of net sales has stabilized based on the companys improved quality efforts and has trended as follows 



  

  

    

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2013 the total accrued warranty liability was 727 million  the accrual is represented as 384 million  in current liabilities and 343 million  in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranties 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances   the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

environmental contingencies  the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range managements estimate of the loss for environmental liability was 40 million  at december 31 2013 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

  

  

    

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2013 are as follows 

 

actual returns on us pension assets were 83 110 and 37 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 and 750 for the year ended december 31 2011 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 128 100 and 33 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 and 750 for the year ended december 31 2011 

 

 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 

  

  

    

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2014 pretax pension expense 



 

 a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company’s us 2014 pretax pension expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 

  



the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the companys total 2014 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost 



see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company’s retirement benefit plans 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 

management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

  

  

    

since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 605 the company’s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2013 the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the morelikelythannot loss on certain of its tax positions which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 

new accounting pronouncements 

in july 2013 the financial accounting standards board amended asc topic 740 income taxes requiring an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward this guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 the company anticipates the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk please refer to note 10 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

  

    

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2013 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 396 of total debt including the impact of the interest rate swaps our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 17 million 16 million and 18 million in the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

 item 1a risk factors   

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse affect on our sales to oems 

  

    

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business 

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply annual price reductions to oem customers have become a permanent feature of our business environment to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face highly volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including steel nickel copper aluminum plastic resins other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases the discontinuation of our ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers if these supply interruptions occur it could adversely affect our business 

  

    

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect these rights could materially adversely impact our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 20 of our us workforce was unionized our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our ithaca and cortland new york facilities this agreement expires in september 2016 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing retirement benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded 

we sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments if the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified our required cash payments may be higher than we expect   

  

    

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have contingent liabilities related to environmental product warranties regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury product liability environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance 

additionally we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions which are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits or changes to tax laws governing the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

  

    

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and d the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost affectively failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including the americas europe and asia for 2012 approximately 74  of our sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and expensive 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted 

additionally our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to any of a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders the customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

furthermore some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2012 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 17  and 13  respectively of our 2012 consolidated net sales 

  

    

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford chrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse affect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this would adversely affect our customer relations and business 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advanced notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines while we have taken definite actions to mitigate these factors we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers compensation claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the companys business insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

  

    

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of natural disasters

rd costs net of customer reimbursements was 2659 million  or 37  of net sales in the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2437 million  or 34  of net sales and 1850 million  or 33  of net sales in the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively we will continue to invest in a number of crossbusiness rd programs as well as a number of other key programs all of which are necessary for short and longterm growth our current longterm expectation for rd spending is approximately 4 of net sales 

other income expense was 847 million  81 million  and 224 million  for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively this line item is primarily comprised of transactions discussed within the subtitle noncomparable items impacting the companys earnings per diluted share and net earnings above 

  

    

equity in affiliates earnings net of tax was 428 million  382 million  and 396 million  in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively this line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50owned japanese joint venture nskwarner and our 326owned indian joint venture turbo energy limited “tel” the increase in equity in affiliates earnings for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 is primarily due to year over year growth in the japanese auto market resulting in improved earnings from the companys interest in nskwarner the decrease in equity in affiliates earnings for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 is primarily due to lower production volumes in japan as a result of natural disasters refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion of nskwarner 

interest expense and finance charges were 394 million  746 million  and 688 million  in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to the april 2012 settlement of the companys convertible senior notes the ineffectiveness of crosscurrency swaps and higher capitalized interest associated with increased longterm capital projects the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2011 compared with the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to higher debt levels 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 314  for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with rates of 255  and 171  for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the companys provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012 includes a net tax benefit of 20 million  associated with the loss from disposal activities and restructuring expense the 20 million  net benefit is comprised of a tax benefit of 77 million  associated with restructuring expense partially offset by tax expense of 57 million  resulting from the sale of the spark plug business additionally the provision includes a tax benefit of 61 million  related to retirement related obligations and additional tax expense of 198 million  resulting from other tax adjustments these other tax adjustments include 59 million  of tax expense primarily resulting from the settlement of certain tax audits 75 million  of tax expense associated with the companys second quarter 2012 decision to change its cash repatriation assertion for some of its foreign subsidiaries 47 million  of tax benefit related to certain countries enacting changes to their respective statutory income tax rates and 111 million  of us tax expense to correct the income taxes payable balance excluding the impact of these noncomparable items the companys annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations for 2012 was 268 

in january 2013 the united states congress passed an extension of the federal research and development tax credit and other international tax provisions through december 31 2013 as a result we expect that our tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the full year 

the effective tax rate of 255  for the year ended december 31 2011 includes 110 million of tax expense associated with the companys patent infringement settlement 27 million of tax expense associated with the loss on disposals and a tax benefit of 62 million resulting from other tax adjustments these other tax adjustments related to a change in state corporate income tax legislation as well as an adjustment of the companys tax accounts as a result of the closure of certain tax audits this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates which differ from those in the us the realization of certain business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items including equity in affiliates earnings excluding the impact of these noncomparable items the companys annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations for 2011 was 248 

  

    

the effective tax rate of 171  for the year ended december 31 2010 differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates which differ from those in the us the realization of certain business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items including equity in affiliates earnings excluding the impact of the items mentioned above the companys annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing business operations was 217 

net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest net of tax of 215 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 increased by 10 million  and 27 million  compared to 2012 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the increases during the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 are primarily related to higher sales and earnings by the companys joint ventures 

results by reporting segment 

the companys business is comprised of two reporting segments engine and drivetrain these segments are strategic business groups which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems 

the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected aftertax return on invested capital roic of its business initiatives roic is comprised of adjusted ebit after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required adjusted ebit is comprised of earnings before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “ebit adjusted for restructuring goodwill impairment charges affiliates earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss 

adjusted ebit is the measure of segment income or loss used by the company the company believes adjusted ebit is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments

outlook 

based on weakening global economic conditions particularly in europe our overall outlook for 2013 is cautious the company expects global production volumes to be slightly higher in 2013 compared with 2012 in europe our largest market we expect production volumes to decline in 2013 compared with 2012 however we expect that higher adoption rates of borgwarner products around the world will result in sales growth for the company in 2013 

the company maintains a positive longterm outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy the trends that are driving our longterm growth are expected to continue including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide the increased adoption of automated transmissions in europe and asiapacific and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in europe and asiapacific 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multicurrency revolving credit agreement at december 31 2012 the company had 7157 million  of cash including 7121 million of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states cash held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments including acquisitions the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation however doing so could result in increased foreign and us federal state and local income taxes a deferred tax liability has been recorded for the portion of these funds anticipated to be repatriated to the united states 

the companys 650 million  multicurrency revolving credit facility which includes a feature that allows the companys borrowings to be increased to 1 billion  provides for borrowings through june 30 2016 and is guaranteed by the companys material domestic subsidiaries the company has two key financial covenants as part of the credit agreement these covenants are a debt compared to ebitda “earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization” test and an interest coverage test the company was in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2012 and expects to remain compliant in future periods at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company had outstanding borrowings of 1400 million  and 700 million  respectively under this facility 

on april 9 2009 the company issued 3738 million  in convertible senior notes which were settled in april 2012 by delivering approximately 114 million  shares of common stock held in treasury to the note holders the settlement resulted in a reduction in the current portion of longterm debt of 3738 million  a reduction in common stock held in treasury of 6173 million  and a reduction in capital in excess of par value of 2435 million  

  

    

in conjunction with the convertible senior note offering the company entered into a bond hedge overlay including both call options and warrants at a net pretax cost of 252 million  effectively raising the conversion premium to 50  or approximately 3861  per share on april 16 2012 the company settled the call option portion of the bond hedge overlay receiving approximately 65 million  shares of its common stock the settlement resulted in an increase to common stock held in treasury of 5039 million  offset by an increase to capital in excess of par value of 5039 million  

during the third and fourth quarters of 2012 the company settled the warrants included in the bond hedge overlay delivering approximately 49 million  shares of its common stock held in treasury resulting in a reduction in common stock held in treasury of 3385 million  offset by a reduction to capital in excess of par value of 3385 million  

in addition to the credit facility the companys universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission has an unlimited amount of various debt and equity instruments that could be issued 

from a credit quality perspective the company has a credit rating of baa2 from moodys in april 2012 the companys credit rating was raised to bbb from bbb by both standard  poor’s and fitch ratings the current outlook from moodys standard  poor’s and fitch ratings is stable none of the company’s debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings 

capitalization 



balance sheet debt decreased by 2619 million  and cash on hand increased by 3561 million  compared to december 31 2011 primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities net of capital expenditures and the companys settlement of its 350 convertible senior notes which was partially offset by share repurchases 

  

    

total equity increased by 6931 million  in the year ended december 31 2012 as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8787 million  7082 million  and 5389 million  in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 primarily reflects improved working capital management the increase in the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 primarily reflects higher earnings 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 3452 million  5645 million  and 4295 million  in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 primarily reflects the cash payment of 2037 million made during the first quarter of 2011 for the acquisition of haldex traction ab and the cash proceeds of 552 million received during the third quarter of 2012 from the sale of the spark plug business which was partially offset by increased capital expenditures the increase in cash used in investing activities in the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to increased capital spending and higher payments for businesses acquired net of cash acquired year over year capital spending increases of 137 million  and 1171 million  during the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively were primarily due to higher spending levels required to meet increased program launches worldwide 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 1886 million  2197 million  and 132 million  for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the 311 million  decrease in the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily driven by decreased purchases of treasury stock partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to noncontrolling stockholders 

the 2065 million  increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 reflects lower net borrowings of 1332 million an increase in the companys purchases of treasury stock of 319 million and the purchase of the noncontrolling interests 40 share of borgwarner vikas emissions systems india private limited of 294 million  

  

    

the companys significant contractual obligation payments at december 31 2012 are as follows 



 

 

we believe that the combination of cash from operations cash balances available credit facilities and the remaining shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future we will continue to balance our needs for internal growth external growth debt reduction and cash conservation 

off balance sheet arrangements 

the company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases types of operating leases include leases on the headquarters facility an airplane vehicles and certain office equipment the total expected future cash outlays for noncancelable operating lease obligations at december 31 2012 is 687 million  see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on operating leases including future minimum payments 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate at december 31 2012 all legal funding requirements had been met the company contributed 180 million  370 million and 251 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the company expects to contribute a total of 15 million  to 25 million  into its defined benefit pension plans during 2013 of the 15 million  to 25 million  in projected 2013 contributions 71 million  are contractual obligations while the remaining payments are discretionary 

the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of 3171 million  and 2364 million  at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively of these amounts 1924 million  and 1287 million  at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively were related to plans in germany where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due 

  

    

other postretirement benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the companys us operations the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred other postretirement benefits had an unfunded status of 2205 million  and 2510 million  at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 

  

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows 

litigation 

in january 2006 borgwarner diversified transmission products inc dtp a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the thencurrent collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtps reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw which did not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of 40 million  as a result of the courts decision 

dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 287 and jim barrett and others individually and as representatives of a defendant class on february 26 2009 again seeking the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor  management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24 2009 certain retirees on behalf of themselves and others filed a mirrorimage action in the united states district court eastern district of michigan southern division on march 11 2009 for which a class has been certified during the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in indiana was dismissed while the action in michigan is continuing the company is vigorously defending against the suit this contingency is subject to many uncertainties therefore based on the information available to date the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss if any a decision on the merits of the suit could be rendered sometime in 2013 

  

    

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 32  such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs and remediation alternatives the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of 39 million  at december 31 2012 the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years 

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the companys 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric in 2007 and 2008 lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 340  plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant the company entered into a settlement in july 2010 regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs and those of approximately 2700  unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs attorneys in exchange for among other things the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants the company agreed to pay up to 28 million  in settlement funds which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010 the company paid 139 million  in november 2010 and made the final payment of 139 million  in february 2011 litigation concerning indemnification is pending and the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings 

product liability 

like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the companys involvement is limited because in general these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm as of both december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 the company had approximately 16000  pending asbestosrelated product liability claims respectively of the approximately 16000  outstanding claims at december 31 2012 approximately half were pending in jurisdictions that have undergone significant tort and judicial reform activities subsequent to the filing of these claims 

  

    

the companys policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in 2012 of the approximately 2400  claims resolved 308   13  resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in the full year of 2011 of the approximately 1800  claims resolved 288   16  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 

prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the companys primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestosrelated claims the company has substantial excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated product claims in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits 

a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies against the company and certain of its historical general liability insurers the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing the company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the company the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers 

on april 5 2010 the superior court of new jersey appellate division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestosrelated action against the company and others the company filed its notice of petition to the supreme court of new jersey in late april seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts on july 8 2010 the supreme court of new jersey denied the companys notice of petition appealing the decision of the lower courts the total claim of 407 million  was paid by the company in july 2010 

although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels due to the encapsulated nature of the products the companys experience in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past and the companys significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing management does not believe that asbestosrelated product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows 

to date the company has paid and accrued 2358 million  in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received 1248 million  in cash and notes from insurers the net balance of 1110 million  is expected to be fully recovered of which approximately 20 million  is expected to be recovered within one year timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements at december 31 2011 insurers owed 1098 million  in association with these claims 

in addition to the 1110 million  net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs the company has estimated a liability of 856 million  for claims asserted but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december 31 2012 the company also has a related asset of 856 million  to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers which is expected to be fully recovered receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above which morelikelythannot will occur subsequent to december 31 2013 at december 31 2011 the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was 617 million  

  

    

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows 



the 2012 increase in the accrued liability and associated insurance asset is primarily due to an expected higher rate of claim settlement based on recent litigation claim activity 

the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses if any in excess of those for which it has accrued because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future the allegations in such claims the possible outcomes or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

cost of sales  the company includes materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials indirect labor factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale 

  

    

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizing intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic 360 a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations longlived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair valuation of the asset 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  during the fourth quarter of each year the company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units this qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value using this qualitative assessment the company determines whether it is morelikelythan not the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value if it is determined that it is not morelikelythannot the reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value or upon a triggering event including recent acquisition or divestiture activity the company performs a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 the company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit and determined it was morelikelythannot the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units for the reporting unit with recent divestiture activity the company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances 

the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine its estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2012 goodwill quantitative step one impairment review are as follows 

 

 

  

    

in addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model 

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2012 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to the reporting unit that was quantitatively assessed was not impaired additionally a sensitivity analysis was completed indicating a 1  increase in the discount rate or a 1  decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of the reporting unit quantitatively assessed 

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 

product warranties the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual our warranty provision over the last three years and as a percentage of net sales has continued to decrease in conjunction with companys improved quality efforts and has trended as follows 



the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2012 the total accrued warranty liability was 649 million  the accrual is represented as 331 million  in current liabilities and 318 million  in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranties 

  

    

other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

environmental contingencies  the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range managements estimate of the loss for environmental liability was 39 million  at december 31 2012 

see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 

pension and other postretirement defined benefits the company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the companys defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2012 are as follows 

 43 

  

    

actual returns on us pension assets were 110 37 and 146 for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the year ended december 31 2012 and 750 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 100 33 and 133 for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 675 for the year ended december 31 2012 and 750 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2013 pretax pension expense 



 

 a 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company’s us 2013 pretax pension expense 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 

  



  

    

the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the companys total 2013 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the companys opeb obligation and service and interest cost 



see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company’s retirement benefit plans 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk please refer to note 10 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2012 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 435 of total debt including the impact of the interest rate swaps our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 16 million 18 million and 16 million in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

    

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the chinese yuan the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen the swedish krona and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps such nonus dollar debt was 2583 million and 2804 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2012 the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 59 million and 98 million respectively of which 52 million in gains and 98 million in losses mature in less than one year 

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2012 the company had no forward and option commodity contracts outstanding

 item 1a risk factors   

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse affect on our sales to oems 

              

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs lower tax rates and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our business 

risks related to our business 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply annual price reductions to oem customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 

we continue to face highly volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products 

the company uses a variety of commodities including steel nickel copper aluminum plastic resins other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any materials increases the discontinuation of ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs would adversely affect our business 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers 

we use important intellectual property in our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

we own important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve our competitors may develop 

              

technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license further as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases despite efforts we undertake to protect them developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect these rights could materially adversely impact our business and our competitive position 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 22 of our us workforce was unionized our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our ithaca and cortland new york facilities this agreement expires in september 2012 the workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing retirement benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded 

we sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments if the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified our required cash payments may be higher than we expect   

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business 

              

we have contingent liabilities related to environmental product warranties regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws 

we provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products under these product warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury environmental and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance 

additionally we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions which are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits or changes to tax laws governing the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our business 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and d the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost affectively failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including the americas europe and asia for 2011 approximately 76  of our sales were outside the us consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems insufficient infrastructures social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and expensive 

              

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted 

additionally our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

risks related to our customers 

we rely on sales to major customers 

we rely on sales to oems around the world of varying credit quality supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company in working capital plant and equipment we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to any of a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders the customers financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons it could adversely affect our business 

furthermore some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2011 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 19  and 12  respectively of our 2011 consolidated net sales 

we are sensitive to the affects of our major customers’ labor relations 

all three of our primary north american customers ford chrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems facilities similarly a majority of our global customers operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse affect on our business 

risks related to our suppliers 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this would adversely affect our customer relations and business 

              

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and others could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advanced notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines while we have taken definite actions to mitigate these factors we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers compensation claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the companys business insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

other risks 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs utilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation and the impact of natural disasters

results by reporting segment 

the companys business is comprised of two reporting segments engine and drivetrain these segments are strategic business groups which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems 

the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected aftertax return on invested capital roic of its business initiatives roic is comprised of adjusted ebit after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required adjusted ebit is comprised of earnings before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “ebit adjusted for restructuring goodwill impairment charges affiliates earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating profit or loss 

adjusted ebit is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the company the company believes adjusted ebit is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments

other matters 

contingencies 

in the normal course of business the company is party to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the companys management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows 

litigation 

in january 2006 borgwarner diversified transmission products inc dtp a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the courts affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the thencurrent collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtps reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw which did not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of 40 million  as a result of the courts decision 

dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 287 and jim barrett and others individually and as 

              

representatives of a defendant class on february 26 2009 again seeking the courts affirmation that dtp will not violate the labor  management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24 2009 certain retirees on behalf of themselves and others filed a mirrorimage action in the united states district court eastern district of michigan southern division on march 11 2009 for which a class has been certified during the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in indiana was dismissed while the action in michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase the company is vigorously defending against the suit this contingency is subject to many uncertainties therefore based on the information available to date the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss if any 

environmental 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 39  such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives and estimated legal fees the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance of 104 million  at december 31 2011 the accrued amounts do not exceed 30 million  related to any individual site except for the crystal springs site discussed below and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years 

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the companys 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric in 2007 and 2008 lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 340  plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant the company entered into a settlement in july 2010 regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs and those of approximately 2700  unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs attorneys in exchange for among other things the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants the company agreed to pay up to 28 million  in settlement funds which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010 the company paid 139 million  in november 2010 and made the final payment of 139 million  in february 2011 litigation concerning indemnification is pending and the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings 

              

product liability 

like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the companys involvement is limited because in general these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the company had approximately 16000  and 17000  pending asbestosrelated product liability claims respectively of the approximately 16000  outstanding claims at december 31 2011 approximately half were pending in jurisdictions that have undergone significant tort and judicial reform activities subsequent to the filing of these claims 

the companys policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in 2011 of the approximately 1800  claims resolved 288   16  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in the full year of 2010 of the approximately 7700  claims resolved 245   3  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 

prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the companys primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestosrelated claims the company has substantial excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestosrelated product claims in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits 

a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies “cna” against the company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing cna and the company have entered into a settlement agreement resolving their coverage disputes pursuant to which cna will pay amounts over the next four years to the company the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers 

although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels due to the encapsulated nature of the products the companys experience in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past and the companys significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing management does not believe that asbestosrelated product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial position or cash flows 

to date the company has paid and accrued 1909 million  in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received 811 million   in cash and notes from insurers including cna the net balance of 1098 million  is expected to be fully recovered of which approximately 33 million  is estimated to be recovered within one year timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements at december 31 2010 insurers owed 1206 million  in association with these claims 

on april 5 2010 the superior court of new jersey appellate division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestosrelated action against the company and others the company filed its notice of petition to the supreme court of new jersey in late april seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts on july 8 2010 the supreme court of new jersey denied the companys notice of petition appealing the decision of the lower courts the total claim of 407 million  was paid by the company in july 2010 

              

in addition to the 1098 million  net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs the company has estimated a liability of 617 million  for claims asserted but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december 31 2011 the company also has a related asset of 617 million  to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers insurance carrier reimbursement of 100   is expected based on the companys experience its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to above at december 31 2010 the comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued liability was 506 million  

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows 



the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses if any in excess of those for which it has accrued because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future the allegations in such claims the possible outcomes or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

              

cost of sales  the company includes materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials indirect labor factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale 

impairment of longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other amortizable intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic 360 a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value 

management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations longlived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset and iii fair value of the asset 

the company recognized 363 million of asset impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2009 within restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

see note 17 “restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the companys impairment of longlived assets and a discussion of marketbased measurements 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  during the fourth quarter of each year or upon a triggering event the company reviews the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units to identify those units with a fair value morelikelythannot less than its carrying value with the exception of two reporting units that had recent acquisition or divestiture activity a qualitative assessment was completed this assessment evaluated various events and circumstances such as macro economic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors relevant events and financial trends that may impact a reporting units fair value after completing this assessment the company determined it was morelikelythannot the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units qualitatively reviewed a quantitative step one impairment analysis therefore was not required 

for the two reporting units with recent acquisition or divestiture activity the company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment analysis which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the companys annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty further the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the companys facts and circumstances the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine its estimated fair value are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value 

              

the primary assumptions affecting the companys december 31 2011 goodwill quantitative step one impairment review are as follows 

 

 

in addition to the above primary assumptions the company notes the following risk to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model 

 

 

 

based on the assumptions outlined above the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2011 indicated the companys goodwill assigned to the two reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired additionally a sensitivity analysis was completed indicating a 1  increase in the discount rate or a 1  decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of either of the reporting units quantitatively assessed 

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 

product warranties the company provides warranties on some but not all of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years  provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual our warranty provision over the last three years and as a percentage of net sales has trended as follows 



              

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the companys accrued warranty liability 



at december 31 2011 the total accrued warranty liability was 727 million  the accrual is represented as 386 million  in current liabilities and 341 million  in noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranties 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

environmental contingencies  the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability managements estimate of the loss range for environmental liability including conditional asset retirement obligations for 2011 is between approximately 8 million and 23 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range at december 31 2011 our total accrued environmental liability was 115 million  which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under asc topic 410 of 11 million  

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 

pension and other post employment defined benefits the company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

the companys defined benefit pension and nonpension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 disability early retirement and other postemployment employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 712 the determination of the companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rate rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the companys accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2011 are as follows 

              

 

actual returns on us pension assets were 37 146 and 253 for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 750 for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

actual returns on uk pension assets were 33 133 and 151 for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 750 for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

 

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled in 2009 the company recorded a valuation allowance that primarily represented foreign net operating losses and us based foreign tax credits for which utilization was uncertain in 2010 the company recorded a reversal of the company’s 212 million valuation allowance on us based foreign tax credit carryforwards 

management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 605 the company’s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax 

              

returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2011 the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

the companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk please refer to note 10 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at december 31 2011 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 624 of total debt including the impact of the interest rate swaps our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 18 million 16 million and 15 million in the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the company also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10 increase in interest rates as of december 31 2011 the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately 24 million assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10 decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2011 the net fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately 23 million our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves the model therefore does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between shortterm and longterm interest rates interest rate sensitivity at december 31 2011 measured in a similar manner was slightly less than at december 31 2010 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen the swedish krona and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps such nonus dollar debt was 2804 million and 2990 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate 

              

risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2011 the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 27 million and 29 million respectively of which 26 million in gains and 24 million in losses mature in less than one year 

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2011 the company had no forward and option commodity contracts outstanding

management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with the company’s respective joint venture partners certain information concerning the company’s joint ventures is set forth below 

 

 

 

 

  

financial information about geographic areas 

 

refer to note 19 “reporting segments and related information” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas 

 

approximately 74 of the company’s consolidated sales for 2010 were outside the united states including exports however a portion of such sales were to oems headquartered outside the united states that produce vehicles that are in turn exported to the united states 

 

customers 

 

approximately 77 of the company’s total sales in 2010 were for lightvehicle applications 16 of the company’s sales were to a diversified group of commercial truck bus construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers and the remaining 7 to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts 

for the most recent threeyear period the company’s worldwide sales to the following customers including their subsidiaries were approximately as follows 

 

 

 

no other single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented 

 

the company’s automotive products are generally sold directly to oems substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts longterm supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the oems the company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the oems 

 

sales and marketing 

 

each of the company’s business units within its two reporting segments has its own sales function account executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve specific oem customers for one or more of a business unit’s products our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with oem purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with oems account executives are able to identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of our products design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with the customers 

 

in addition the sales and marketing employees of our engine segment and drivetrain segment often work together to explore crossdevelopment opportunities for the business units the development of dualtronic ®  the company’s wetclutch and controlsystem technology for a newconcept automated transmission is an example of a successful collaboration 

 

seasonality 

 

the company’s business is moderately seasonal because the company’s largest north american customers typically halt vehicle production for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december customers in europe and asia typically shut down vehicle production during portions of july or august and one week in the fourth quarter accordingly the company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those practices 

 

research and development 

 

the company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at the reporting segment level this advanced engineering function looks to leverage knowhow and expertise across product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized a venture capital fund that was created by the company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses is managed by this function 

 

in addition each of the company’s business units within its two reporting segments has its own research and development “rd” organization the company has approximately 700 employees including engineers mechanics and technicians engaged in rd activities at facilities worldwide the company also operates testing facilities such as prototype measurement and calibration life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories

in addition a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products other current oem customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates 

 

for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies also see item 1a risk factors 

 

workforce 

 

as of december 31 2010 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had a salaried and hourly workforce of approximately 17500 as compared with approximately 12500 at december 31 2009 of which approximately 5000 were in the us approximately 23 of the company’s us workforce is unionized the hourly workforces at certain of our international facilities are also unionized the company believes its present relations with our workforce to be satisfactory 

 

our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our ithaca and cortland new york facilities this agreement expires in september 2012 

 

raw materials 

 

the company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of its automotive products including steel aluminum copper plastic resins and certain alloy elements manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity 

 

due to a global economic recovery in 2010 commodity prices increased after dropping sharply in 2009 the 2009 decline in commodity prices was due to falling global demand and oversupply 

 

as developed economies continue to recover and auto production accelerates certain commodities may experience temporary shortages and inflated prices until production volumes again reach equilibrium with market demands the company uses a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary pressures 

 

the company’s global procurement organization works to accelerate cost reductions purchases from lower cost regions supplier rationalization risk mitigation efforts and collaborative buying activities in addition the company uses longterm contracts cost sharing arrangements design changes customer buy programs and limited financial instruments to help control costs the company intends to use similar measures in 2011 and beyond refer to note 10 “financial instruments” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information related to the company’s hedging activities

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

 

our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns 

 

automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers 

 

we continue to take steps to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements significant declines in the automotive industry and financial declines and restructurings by our significant customers may make it necessary to take restructuring actions and charges 

 

we are dependent on market segments that use our key products decreased demand in those segments could adversely affect our business 

 

some of our products in particular turbochargers are currently used primarily in diesel passenger cars and commercial vehicles any significant reduction in production in these market segments or loss of business in these market segments could have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers 

 

we face strong competition 

 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically 

integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us original equipment manufacturer customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our businesses 

 

we are under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce the prices of our products 

 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs including costs of products we supply although original equipment manufacturers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major original equipment manufacturer customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these original equipment manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply we believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive however we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain our gross margins on product sales to original equipment manufacturers or that the trend by original equipment manufacturers towards outsourcing will continue 

 

annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our original equipment manufacturer customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions increases in raw material costs and increases in employee wages and benefits 

 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

 

all three of our primary north american customers ford chrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic original equipment manufacturers’ dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original equipment manufacturers’ facilities similarly a majority of our global customers’ operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

part of our labor force is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

 

as of december 31 2010 approximately 23 of our us workforce was unionized our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our ithaca and cortland new york facilities this agreement expires in september 2012 the hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized while we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials we believe that our business operations and activities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental health and safety laws however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur 

material costs or liabilities as a result furthermore through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future 

 

we have contingent liabilities related to environmental product warranties regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws as a result as of december 31 2010 we may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 38 of these sites 

 

we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability management’s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability including conditional asset retirement obligations for 2010 is between approximately 27 million and 42 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range based on information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental liabilities of 292 million which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under asc topic 410 of 12 million at december 31 2010 we currently expect the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the next three to five years 

 

we provide warranties to our customers for some of our products under these warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our financial statement based upon information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for product warranties of 668 million at december 31 2010 

 

we are also party to or have an obligation to defend a party to various legal proceedings including those described in note 14 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers intellectual property matters and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate 

 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

 

we have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and d the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively 

 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions and countries including north america europe china india south korea japan and brazil and sell our products worldwide for 2010 

approximately 74 of our sales were outside north america consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and expensive see note 19 “reporting segments and related information” to consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k regarding the size of our international operations 

 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

 

we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments it could adversely affect our business 

 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits 

 

the automotive industry like other industries continues to be impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits to partially address this impact we continue to make adjustments to certain retiree medical and pension plans see note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

certain defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently underfunded 

 

we sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments additionally if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations or if other actuarial assumptions are modified our required contributions may be higher than we expect see note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business 

 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

additionally we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our business 

 

we rely on sales to major customers 

 

we rely on sales to original equipment manufacturers around the world supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company in working capital plant and equipment some of our customers are rated by the credit rating agencies as below investment grade the loss of sales to a major customer due to any of a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders the customer’s financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons could adversely affect our business 

 

furthermore some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2010 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 19 and 11 respectively of our 2010 consolidated sales 

 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

 

rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and others could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advanced notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply 

interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines while we have taken definite actions to mitigate these factors we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

 

we continue to face highly volatile commodity costs used in the production of our products 

 

the company uses a variety of commodities including steel nickel copper aluminum plastic resins other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible or by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any materials increases the discontinuation of ability to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs would adversely affect our business 

 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers 

 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god” or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this would adversely affect our customer relations and business 

 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted 

 

additionally our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded the interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry original equipment manufacturers have experienced difficulties from a weakened economy and tightened credit markets if our customers reduce their orders to us it would adversely affect our results of operations a prolonged downturn in the automotive industry or a significant product mix shift due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or incur impairment charges continued uncertainty relating to the financial condition of automakers may adversely affect our business 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

 

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers’ compensation claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the company’s business insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business 

 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business 

 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems 

 

to improve efficiency and reduce costs we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing payroll and general management operations if the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled key business processes could be interrupted which could adversely affect our business 

 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers start — up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs underutilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others and global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation

our net sales increase in 2010 of 427 was better than the estimated worldwide market production increase of 235 our net sales decrease in 2009 of 247 was worse than the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 137 the effect of changing currency rates had a negative impact on the company’s net sales and net earnings in 2010 and in 2009 the effect of nonus currencies primarily the euro decreased net sales by approximately 90 million in 2010 nonus currencies had a negligible impact on the company’s net earnings in 2010 in 2009 nonus currencies primarily the euro decreased net sales by approximately 169 million and reduced the company’s net earnings by approximately 4 million 

the year over year increase in net sales excluding the unfavorable impact of currency was 45 in 2010 the year over year decrease in net sales excluding the unfavorable impact of currency was 215 in 2009 

 

consolidated net sales to a single customer including their subsidiaries which exceeded 10 of our total sales were to volkswagen of approximately 19 22 and 19 and to ford of approximately 11 12 and 9 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively both of our reporting segments had significant sales to the customers listed above such sales consisted of a variety of products to a variety of customer locations and regions no other single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented 

 

outlook 

 

our overall outlook for 2011 is positive the company expects global production volumes to be higher in 2011 compared with 2010 furthermore we expect that higher adoption rates of borgwarner products around the world will result in sales growth for the company above global production growth in 2011 

 

the company maintains a positive longterm outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy the trends that are driving our longterm growth are expected to continue including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide the increased adoption of automated transmissions in europe and asiapacific and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in both europe and asiapacific 

 

results by reporting segment 

 

the company’s business is comprised of two reporting segments engine and drivetrain these segments are strategic business groups which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems 

 

the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected aftertax return on invested capital “roic” of its business initiatives the roic is comprised of projected earnings before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “ebit” adjusted for restructuring goodwill impairment charges affiliates’ earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating profit or loss “adjusted ebit” compared to the projected average capital investment required 

 

adjusted ebit is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the company the company believes adjusted ebit is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments 

 

the following tables present net sales and segment adjusted ebit for the years 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

net sales 

 

 

adjusted earnings loss before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “adjusted ebit” 

 

 

 

the engine segment 2010 net sales increased 11776 million or 408 and segment ebit increased 3181 million or 1447 from the year ended december 31 2009 excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies primarily the euro sales increased approximately 44 the sales increase was primarily driven by strong global growth in all major product groups as well as the second quarter 2010 acquisition of dytech ensa sl the segment ebit margin was 132 in 2010 up from 76 in 2009 due to a significant increase in customer production schedules in the us and european market and continued cost management 

 

the engine segment 2009 net sales were down 253 from 2008 with a 443 decrease in segment ebit over the same period the engine segment decrease was primarily driven by reduced global vehicle production and depressed demand for engine products the segment ebit margin was 76 in 2009 down from 102 in 2008 due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the us and european markets 

 

the drivetrain segment 2010 net sales increased 5179 million or 474 and segment ebit increased 1505 million from the year ended december 31 2009 excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies primarily the euro sales increased approximately 49 the sales increase was primarily driven by strong growth of transmission components and torque management devices in europe asia and the us segment ebit margin was 85 in 2010 up from 12 in 2009 primarily due to higher global production of light trucks and sportutility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products and continued cost management 

 

the drivetrain segment 2009 net sales decreased 233 from 2008 with a 1755 decrease in segment ebit over the same period the group was negatively impacted by lower global production of light trucks and suvs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products segment ebit margin was 12 in 2009 down from 03 in the prior year primarily due to lower global production of light trucks and sportutility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products 

corporate represents corporate headquarters’ expenses expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments expenses associated with divested operations and equity in affiliates’ earnings this net expense was 1110 million in 2010 1113 million in 2009 and 600 million in 2008 the increase in corporate expenses in 2009 from 2008 is primarily related to a decline in affiliate earnings an increase in pension and other postemployment expenses and an increase in performance related compensation 

 

other factors affecting results of operations 

 

the following table details our results of operations as a percentage of sales 

 

 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 193 142 and 159 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the gross margin percentage increase is primarily due to higher sales in 2010 and successful cost reduction actions taken in 2009 and 2008 offset by higher raw material costs cost reduction actions taken in 2009 and 2008 to reduce our cost structure included headcount reductions global pay cuts selected plant shutdowns and reduced work weeks outside of the us 

 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” as a percentage of net sales were 100 116 and 103 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 2010 sga expenses increased 1068 million or 232 compared to 2009 the 2010 decrease in sga as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a significant year over year increase in sales offset by an increase in performance related compensation 

 

research and development “rd” is a major component of our sga expenses rd spending net of customer reimbursements was 1850 million or 33 of sales in 2010 compared to 1552 million or 39 of sales in 2009 and 2057 million or 39 of sales in 2008 we currently intend to continue to increase our spending in rd although the growth rate in the future may not necessarily match the rate of our sales growth we also intend to continue to invest in a number of crossbusiness rd programs as well as a number of other key programs all of which are necessary for short and longterm growth our current longterm expectation for rd spending is approximately 40 of sales we intend to maintain our commitment to rd spending while continuing to focus on controlling other sga costs 

 

restructuring expense of 503 million in 2009 and 1275 million in 2008 was in response to declines in global customer production levels customer restructurings and a subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in north america europe and asia and our longterm capacity needs 

on july 31 2008 the company announced a restructuring of its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing fundamental market shift in the auto industry as a continuation of the company’s third quarter restructuring on december 11 2008 the company announced plans for additional restructuring actions as a result of these third and fourth quarter 2008 restructuring actions the company had reduced its north american workforce by approximately 2400 people or 33 its european workforce by approximately 1600 people or 18 and its asian workforce by approximately 400 people or 17 the restructuring expense recognized for employee termination benefits was 546 million in addition to employee termination costs the company recorded 729 million of asset impairment charges related to the north american and european restructuring the combined 2008 restructuring expenses of 1275 million are broken out by segment as follows engine 853 million drivetrain 409 million and corporate 13 million 

 

in the second quarter of 2009 the company took additional restructuring actions the company reduced its north american workforce by approximately 550 people or 12 its european workforce by approximately 150 people or 2 and its asian workforce by approximately 60 people or 3 in the second quarter the net restructuring expense recognized in the second quarter was 90 million for employee termination benefits in addition to employee termination costs the company recorded 363 million of asset impairment and 50 million of other charges in the second quarter of 2009 related to the north american and european restructuring the combined 2009 restructuring expenses of 503 million are broken out by segment as follows engine 272 million drivetrain 197 million and corporate 34 million 

 

included in the second quarter of 2009 asset impairment charge is 223 million related to one of the company’s european locations during the second quarter of 2009 circumstances caused the company to evaluate the long range outlook of the facility using an undiscounted and discounted cash flow model both of which indicated that assets were impaired the company then used a replacement cost technique to determine the fair value of the assets at the facility this reduction of asset value was included in the engine segment 

 

refer to note 17 “restructuring” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

 

equity in affiliates’ earnings net of tax was 396 million 218 million and 384 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively this line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50 owned japanese joint venture nskwarner and our 326 owned indian joint venture turbo energy limited “tel” the significant increase in equity in affiliates’ earnings in 2010 is primarily due to higher vehicle production in asia for more discussion of nskwarner see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

interest expense and finance charges were 688 million 572 million and 388 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in 2010 over 2009 and 2009 over 2008 was primarily due to accretion of the discounted carrying value of our 3738 million convertible senior notes and higher debt levels 

 

the provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate for 2010 of 171 compared with rates of 1034 in 2009 and 2379 in 2008 the 2010 tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates which differ from those in the us the realization of certain business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items including equity in affiliates’ earnings excluding the impacts of the reversal of the valuation allowance on us based foreign tax credits the change in tax treatment for medicare part d subsidies the berueichenauer equity investment gain and the company’s environmental litigation settlement the company’s annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing business operations was 217 

 

the effective tax rate of 1034 for 2009 differs from the us statutory rate primarily due a reduction in us income foreign rates which differ from those in the us the realization of certain business tax credits including rd and us based foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items including equity in affiliates’ earnings 

 

noncontrolling interest net of tax of 188 million increased by 94 million from 2009 and 25 million from 2008 the increase between 2010 and 2009 is primarily related to higher sales and earnings by the company’s joint ventures the increase between 2010 and 2008 is primarily related to higher sales by the company’s joint ventures offset by the company’s increased ownership to 100 of beru 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

capitalization 

 

 

 

  

total equity increased by 871 million in 2010 as follows 

 

 

 

the currency translation component of other comprehensive income decreased in 2010 primarily due to the weakening of the euro and british pound in relation to the us dollar 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 5389 million 3510 million and 4008 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the 1879 million increase in 2010 from 2009 primarily reflects higher earnings offset by higher working capital needs as compared to 2009 the 5389 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 consists of net earnings of 3962 million increased for noncash charges of 2495 million and a 1068 million decrease in net operating assets and liabilities noncash charges are primarily comprised of 2529 million in depreciation and amortization 

 

the 498 million decrease in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to lower operational earnings somewhat offset by lower working capital needs 

 

inventory increased in 2010 by 790 million excluding the impact of currency due to higher business levels in all regions of the world inventory management continues to remain an area of focus for the company as sales volumes continue to stabilize 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 4295 million 1548 million and 3439 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively this increase is primarily due to the 1476 million acquisition of dytech the 96 million acquisition of the company’s 50  50 berueichenauer joint venture and the final 75 million payment for the june 2009 purchase of etatech inc capital expenditures including tooling outlays “capital spending” of 2766 million in 2010 or 49 of sales increased 1046 million over the 2009 level of 1720 million or 43 of sales selective capital spending remains an area of focus for us both in order to support our book of new business and for cost reduction and other purposes heading into 2011 we plan to continue to spend capital to support the launch of our new applications and for cost reductions and productivity improvement projects

financing activities net debt increases excluding the impact of currency translation were 2563 million 1024 million and 1075 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the change is mostly due to the company’s september 16 2010 issuance of 250 million in 4625 senior notes offset by the repurchasing of approximately 71 million shares of its common stock in 2010 proceeds from stock options exercised net of tax benefit were 671 million 87 million and 171 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the company paid dividends to borgwarner stockholders of 138 million and 511 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the company had treasury stock purchases of 3312 million in 2010 of which 3257 million has been paid for as of december 31 2010 the company had treasury stock purchases of 559 million in 2008

other matters 

 

contingencies 

 

in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks see notes 7 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the company’s environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

litigation 

 

in january 2006 dtp a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the court’s affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the thencurrent collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtp’s reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw which did not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of 40 million as a result of the court’s decision 

 

dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 287 and jim barrett and others individually and as representatives of a defendant class on february 26 2009 again seeking the court’s affirmation that dtp will not violate the labor — management relations act or erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24 2009 certain retirees on behalf of themselves and others filed a mirrorimage action in the united states district court eastern district of michigan southern division on march 11 2009 for which a class has been certified during the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in indiana was dismissed while the action in michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase the company is vigorously defending against the suit this contingency is subject to many uncertainties therefore based on the information available to date the company cannot estimate the amount or the range of potential loss if any 

 

environmental 

 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 38 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies 

will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives and estimated legal fees the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2010 of 280 million the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed 30 million related to any individual site except for the crystal springs site discussed below and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 

 

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the company’s 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged environmental contamination in 2005 the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99 of those claims and the remainder of them have since been dismissed 

 

in 2007 and 2008 four additional lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 340 plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination one of the lawsuits involving a single plaintiff was dismissed by the trial court in april 2010 and the plaintiff’s appeal of that decision was dismissed by the appellate court in august 2010 the company entered into a settlement in july 2010 regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs in the other three lawsuits and those of approximately 2700 unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs’ attorneys in exchange for among other things the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants the company agreed to pay up to 28 million in settlement funds which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010 in november 2010 the company paid 139 million related to this settlement the remaining payment of approximately 14 million is expected to be paid in february 2011 

 

conditional asset retirement obligations 

 

in march 2005 asc topic 410 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations which requires the company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished the liability exists because the facility will not last forever but it is conditional on future renovations even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition similarly government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use ceases the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers and capacitors when their use ceases and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners and leadbased paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition the company currently has 45 manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items the fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at 12 million as of december 31 2010 and 13 million at december 31 2009 

 

product liability 

 

like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the company’s involvement is limited because in general these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the 

company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 the company had approximately 17000 and 23000 pending asbestosrelated product liability claims respectively of the 17000 outstanding claims at december 31 2010 approximately 8000 were pending in just three jurisdictions where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway 

 

the company’s policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in 2010 of the approximately 7700 claims resolved 245 32 resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in the full year of 2009 of the approximately 5300 claims resolved only 223 42 resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 

 

prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the company’s primary layer insurance coverage and these carriers administered defended settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestosrelated claims the company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestosrelated product claims as such the company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities 

 

in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits this led the company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage since june 2004 secondary layer insurers have been responsible for asbestosrelated litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement 

 

a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies “cna” against the company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers cna provided the company with both primary and additional layer insurance and in conjunction with other insurers is currently defending and indemnifying the company in its pending asbestosrelated product liability claims the lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the company including whether the available limits exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an “aggregate” basis and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned on august 15 2005 the court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter the interim order has the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to timeontherisk with the proration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage appeals of the interim order were denied however the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action 

 

although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels due to the encapsulated nature of the products the company’s experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past and the company’s significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing management does not believe that asbestosrelated product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

 

to date the company has paid and accrued 1531 million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers’ reimbursement which includes the 407 million referred to below and has received 325 million in cash from insurers the net outstanding balance of 1206 million is expected to be fully recovered of which approximately 43 million is expected to be recovered within one year timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above at december 31 2009 insurers owed 586 million in association with these claims 

 

on april 5 2010 the superior court of new jersey appellate division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestosrelated action against the company and others the company filed its notice of petition to the supreme court of new jersey in late april seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts on july 8 2010 the supreme court of new jersey denied the company’s notice of petition appealing the decision of the lower courts the total claim of 407 million was paid by the company in july 2010 

in addition to the 1206 million net outstanding balance relating to past settlements and defense costs the company has estimated a liability of 506 million for claims asserted but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december 31 2010 the company also has a related asset of 506 million to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers insurance carrier reimbursement of 100 is expected based on the company’s experience its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to below at december 31 2009 the comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued liability was 499 million 

 

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows 

 

 

 

the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses if any in excess of those for which it has accrued because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future the allegations in such claims the possible outcomes or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations these policies require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

 

use of estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

 

depreciation 

 

the automotive industry experienced unprecedented declines in production in the fourth quarter of 2008 and projected continued declines for the full year of 2009 according to accounting standards codification “asc” 250 future depreciation expense should be revised due to a change in the estimated future benefits inherent in an asset the pattern of consumption of those benefits or the information available to the entity about those benefits as a result of the 2008 and 2009 unprecedented declines in production activity the 

company determined that its usage pattern for certain assets had changed significantly and revised the useful lives of certain equipment starting in 2009 this adjustment was considered to be a change in an accounting estimate 

 

the impact to the company in 2010 and 2009 were as follows unaudited 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

in accordance with asc topic 360 the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review such events and circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in market volumes or project life or a loss of a major customer application ie a “triggering event” the company’s impairment review is performed at each manufacturing assembly and technical site using data that is the basis for the company’s annual budget or forecast on an interim basis and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments if a triggering event has occurred the assets are identified by the operating location and management as potentially impaired and a recoverability review is performed by management the review will determine if a current or future alternative use exists for additional customer applications or if redeployment of the assets to any of the company’s other operating sites around the world is justified the recoverability test compares projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of a product line or a specific customer application or asset grouping as applicable 

 

if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a fair value analysis management determines fair value under asc topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market income or cost approach management believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions with respect to future volumes program project life or future asset use in addition to future cash flows underlying these estimates could affect the company’s fair value evaluations 

 

due to the sudden decline in the global automotive markets in 2008 and 2009 the company reviewed the carrying value of its longlived assets as a result of these reviews the company recognized 363 million and 729 million in impairment of longlived assets ie plant and equipment as part of restructuring 

expenses in 2009 and 2008 respectively the 2009 and 2008 impairment charges are broken out by segment as follows 

 

 

 

see note 17 “restructuring” and note 9 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company’s 2009 and 2008 impairment of longlived assets and a discussion of marketbased measurements 

 

goodwill 

 

the company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units or more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review 

 

the company’s goodwill impairment review under asc topic 350 requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of our goodwill impairment analysis is the company’s annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments as part of the projection we assumed the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance including fundamental industry growth for the business beyond the five year period into perpetuity as the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty we also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the company’s december 31 2010 goodwill impairment review are as follows 

 

  

in addition to the above significant assumptions the company notes the following risk to volume assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model 

 

  

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company’s analysis related to one of its reporting units in the engine operating segment whose estimated fair value is 112 of its carrying value 

 

based on our sensitivity analysis a 1 increase in the discount rate or a 1 decrease in the operating margin assumptions would result in the carrying value exceeding the estimated fair value of one reporting unit tested within the engine operating segment this would require further evaluation of the reporting unit’s 

goodwill under a step two impairment test the following table illustrates the sensitivity to the estimated fair value of that reporting unit 

 

 

 

in 2008 the company recorded impairment charges totaling €1115 1568 million to adjust beru’s goodwill to its estimated fair value the impairment charge is attributable to a decrease in the operating unit’s estimated fair value based primarily upon the effect of the decline in european market conditions on current and projected operating results the impairment charge was also impacted by the recognition of additional goodwill in the second quarter of 2008 which was based on the court determined buy out value of €7132 per share related to the domination and profit transfer agreement any differences in future results compared to management’s estimates could result in fair values different from estimated fair values which could materially impact the company’s future results of operations and financial condition 

 

see note 18 “recent transactions” for further discussion on the beru domination and profit transfer agreement 

 

the impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 indicated no impairment for either year and estimated fair value to be approximately 360 and 220 for the company’s carrying value in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 

 

environmental accrual 

 

we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability management’s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability including conditional asset retirement obligations for 2010 is between approximately 26 million and 40 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range at the end of 2010 our total accrued environmental liability was 292 million which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under asc topic 410 of 12 million 

 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 

 

product warranty 

 

the company provides warranties on some of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual our warranty provision over the last three years and as a percentage of net sales has trended as follows 

 

 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of sales in the assumed warranty trend on the company’s accrued warranty liability 

 

 

 

at the end of 2010 our total accrued warranty liability was 668 million the accrual is represented as 370 million in current liabilities and 298 million in noncurrent liabilities on our balance sheet 

 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranty 

 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances 

 

the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers’ compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization we estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

 

pension and other post employment defined benefits 

 

the company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

 

using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions the company’s defined benefit pension and nonpension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 disability early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 712 

 

the determination of the company’s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain of the more important assumptions are described in note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k and include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets rates of increase in compensation and health care costs retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

 

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the company’s accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2010 are as follows 

 

 42 

 

actual return on us pension assets for 2010 2009 and 2008 were 146 253 and 257 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 750 in 2010 and 2009 and 875 for 2008 

 

actual return on uk pension assets for 2010 2009 and 2008 were 133 151 and 187 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 750 in 2010 and 2009 and 725 for 2008 

 

  

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company’s pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 

 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2011 pretax pension expense 

 

 

 

  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 

 

 

 

the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s total 2011 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the company’s opeb obligation and service and interest cost 

 

 

 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company’s retirement benefit plans 

 

income taxes 

 

the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled in 2008 and 2009 the company recorded a valuation allowance that primarily represented foreign net operating losses and us based foreign tax credits for which utilization was uncertain in 2010 the company recorded a reversal of the company’s 212 million valuation allowance on us based foreign tax credit carryforwards 

 

management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 605 the company’s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2010 the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 

 

the company’s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk for quantitative disclosures about market risk please refer to note 10 “financial instruments” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at the end of 2010 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 695 of total debt including the impact of the interest rate swaps our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 16 million in 2010 and 15 million in 2009 

 

we also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10 change in interest rates as of december 31 2010 the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately 280 million if interest rates decreased and would decrease by approximately 260 million if interest rates increased our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves the model therefore does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between shortterm and longterm interest rates interest rate sensitivity at december 31 2009 measured in a similar manner was slightly more than at december 31 2010 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps such nonus dollar debt was 2990 million as of december 31 2010 and 3031 million as of december 31 2009 we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2010 the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 27 million and 

64 million respectively of which 26 million in gains and 33 million in losses mature in less than one year as of december 31 2010 01 million in losses did not qualify for deferral 

 

commodity price risk 

 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2010 the company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of 12 million

financial information about geographic areas 

 

refer to note 19 “reporting segments and related information” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas 

 

approximately 73 of the company’s consolidated sales for 2009 were outside the united states including exports however a portion of such sales were to oems headquartered outside the united states that produce vehicles that are in turn exported to the united states 

 

customers 

 

approximately 75 of the company’s total sales in 2009 were for lightvehicle applications 17 of the company’s sales were to a diversified group of commercial truck bus construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers and the remaining 8 to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts 

 

for the most recent threeyear period the company’s worldwide sales to the following customers including their subsidiaries were approximately as follows 

 

 

 

no other single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented 

 

the company’s automotive products are generally sold directly to oems substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts longterm supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the oems the company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the oems 

 

sales and marketing 

 

each of the company’s business units within its two reporting segments has its own sales function account executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve specific oem customers for one or more of a business unit’s products our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact 

with oem purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with oems account executives are able to identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of our customer’s needs and our products and design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with the customers 

 

in addition the sales and marketing employees of our engine segment and drivetrain segment often work together to explore crossdevelopment opportunities for the business units the development of dualtronic the company’s wetclutch and controlsystem technology for a newconcept automated transmission is an example of a successful collaboration 

 

seasonality 

 

the company’s business is moderately seasonal because the company’s largest north american customers typically halt vehicle production for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december additionally customers in europe and asia typically shut down vehicle production during portions of july or august and one week in the fourth quarter accordingly the company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those practices 

 

research and development 

 

the company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at the segment level this advanced engineering function looks to leverage knowhow and expertise across product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized a venture capital fund that was created by the company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses is managed by this function 

 

in addition each of the company’s business units within its two reporting segments has its own research and development “rd” organization the company has approximately 700 employees including engineers mechanics and technicians engaged in rd activities at facilities worldwide the company also operates testing facilities such as prototype measurement and calibration life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories 

 

by working closely with the oems and anticipating their future product needs the company’s rd personnel conceive design develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems rd personnel also work to improve current products and production processes the company believes its commitment to rd will allow it to obtain new orders from its oem customers 

 

the following table presents the company’s gross and net expenditures on rd activities 

 

 

 

the company’s net rd expenditures are included in the selling general and administrative expenses of the consolidated statements of operations net rd expenditures as a percentage of net sales were 39 in 2009 and 2008 and 40 in 2007 customer reimbursements are netted against gross rd expenditures upon billing of services performed the company has contracts with several customers at the company’s various rd locations no such contract exceeded 60 million in any of the years presented 

 

patents and licenses 

 

the company has approximately 4200 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others while it considers 

its patents on the whole to be important the company does not consider any single patent any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the company’s business groups individually the expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operating results the company owns numerous trademarks some of which are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate 

 

the company owns the “borgwarner” and “borgwarner automotive” trade names and housemarks and variations thereof which are material to the company’s business 

 

competition 

 

the company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company price quality delivery technological innovation application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition 

 

the company’s major competitors by product type follow 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products other current oem customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates 

 

for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies also see item 1a risk factors 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2009 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 12500 salaried and hourly employees as compared with approximately 13800 employees at december 31 2008 of which approximately 4100 were us employees the approximately 13800 employees at december 31 2008 included anticipated reductions which did occur in 2009 refer to note 17 “restructuring” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a discussion of actions taken in 2009 approximately 19 of the company’s us workforce is unionized the hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory 

 

our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our ithaca and cortland new york facilities this agreement expires in september 2012 

 

raw materials 

 

the company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of its automotive products including steel aluminum copper plastic resins and certain alloying elements manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity 

 

commodity prices dropped sharply in 2009 due to falling global demands and their subsequent oversupply commodity prices have recovered much of their value and have returned to 2007 levels after bottoming out during the recession of 2009 

 

as developed economies recover and auto production accelerates certain commodities may experience temporary shortages and inflated prices until production volumes again reach equilibrium with market demands the company uses a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary pressures 

 

the company formed a global procurement organization to accelerate cost reductions purchases from lower cost regions supplier rationalization risk mitigation efforts and collaborative buying activities in addition the company uses longterm contracts cost sharing arrangements design changes customer buy programs and limited financial instruments to help control costs the company intends to use similar measures in 2010 and beyond refer to note 10 “financial instruments” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information related to the company’s hedging activities 

 

for 2010 the company believes that its supplies of raw materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements 

 

environmental regulation and proceedings 

 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 35 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting 

costs remediation alternatives and estimated legal fees the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2009 of 210 million the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed 30 million related to any individual site except for the crystal springs site discussed below and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 

 

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the company’s 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged environmental contamination in 2005 the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99 of those claims and the remainder of them have since been dismissed 

 

in 2007 and 2008 four additional lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 340 plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination at this stage of the litigation the company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome but it is vigorously defending against the suits 

 

conditional asset retirement obligations 

 

in march 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standard codification “asc” topic 410 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations which requires the company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished the liability exists because the facility will not last forever but it is conditional on future renovations even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition similarly government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use ceases the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers and capacitors when their use ceases and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners and leadbased paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition the company currently has 31 manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items the fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at 13 million as of december 31 2009 and 14 million as of december 31 2008

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

 

our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns 

 

automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences further economic decline that results in further significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers 

 

we continue to take steps to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements further significant declines in the automotive industry and financial declines and restructurings by our significant customers may make it necessary to take further restructuring actions and charges 

 

we are dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments 

 

some of our products in particular turbochargers are currently used primarily in diesel passenger cars and commercial vehicles any significant reduction in production in these market segments or loss of business in these market segments could have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers 

 

we face strong competition 

 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality delivery technological innovation application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us original equipment manufacturer customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as 

lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our businesses 

 

we are under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce the prices of our products 

 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs including costs of products we supply although original equipment manufacturers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major original equipment manufacturer customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these original equipment manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply we believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive however we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain our gross margins on product sales to original equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will continue 

 

annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our original equipment manufacturer customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs 

 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

 

all three of our primary north american customers ford chrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic original equipment manufacturers’ dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original equipment manufacturers’ facilities similarly a majority of our global customers’ operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

part of our labor force is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

 

as of december 31 2009 approximately 19 of our us workforce was unionized our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our ithaca and cortland new york facilities this agreement expires in september 2012 the hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized while we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials we believe that our business operations and activities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental health and safety laws however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result furthermore through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future 

we have contingent liabilities related to environmental product warranties regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws as a result as of december 31 2009 we may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 35 of these sites 

 

we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability management’s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability including conditional asset retirement obligations for 2009 is between approximately 20 million and 40 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range based on information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental liabilities including our conditional asset retirement obligation under asc topic 410 with a balance of 13 million at december 31 2009 we currently expect the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the next three to five years 

 

we provide warranties to our customers for some of our products under these warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our financial statement based upon information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for product warranties of 617 million at december 31 2009 

 

we are also party to or have an obligation to defend a party to various legal proceedings including those described in note 14 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers intellectual property matters and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate 

 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

 

we have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and d the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively 

 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions and countries including north america europe china india south korea japan and brazil and sell our products worldwide for 2009 approximately 72 of our sales were outside north america consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and 

expensive see note 19 “reporting segments and related information” to consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k regarding the size of our international operations 

 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

 

we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments it could adversely affect our business 

 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits 

 

the automotive industry like other industries continues to be impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits to partially address this impact we continue to make adjustments to certain retiree medical and pension plans see note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

certain defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently underfunded 

 

we sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments additionally if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations or if other actuarial assumptions are modified our required contributions may be higher than we expect see note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business 

 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

additionally we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our business 

 

we rely on sales to major customers 

 

we rely on sales to original equipment manufacturers around the world supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company in working capital plant and equipment some of our customers are rated by the credit rating agencies as below investment grade the loss of sales to a major customer due to any of a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders the customer’s financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons could adversely affect our business 

 

furthermore some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2009 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 22 and 12 respectively of our 2009 consolidated sales 

 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and have a material effect on our business 

 

unfavorable industry conditions such as lower production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and others could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advanced notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines while we have taken definite actions to mitigate these factors we can not predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we continue to face highly volatile commodity costs used in the production of our products 

 

the company uses a variety of commodities including steel nickel copper aluminum plastic resins other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible or by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any materials increases the discontinuation of being able to passthrough or hedge increasing commodity costs would adversely affect our business 

 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers 

 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god” or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this would adversely affect our customer relations and business 

 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted 

 

additionally our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

 

conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business 

 

our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry original equipment manufactures have experienced difficulties from a weakened economy and tightened credit markets if our customers reduce their orders to us it would adversely affect our results of operations a prolonged downturn in the automotive industry or a significant product mix shift due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or incur impairment charges continued uncertainty relating to the financial condition of automakers would have a negative impact on our business 

 

we are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties 

 

the company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies letters of credit credit line agreements financial derivatives and investment management agreements involving various counterparties the company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts 

we are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers 

 

the company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers’ compensation claims health care benefits pension benefits stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services these service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the company’s business so the company could be adversely affected in the event of insolvency of one or more of these service providers 

 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect our business 

 

any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers start — up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs underutilization of our manufacturing facilities which can be dependent on a single product line or customer inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others and global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

introduction 

 

borgwarner inc and consolidated subsidiaries the “company” is a leading global supplier of highly engineered systems and components primarily for powertrain applications our products help improve vehicle performance fuel efficiency air quality and vehicle stability they are manufactured and sold worldwide primarily to original equipment manufacturers “oems” of light vehicles ie passenger cars sportutility vehicles “suvs” crossover vehicles vans and light trucks our products are also manufactured and sold to oems of commercial trucks buses and agricultural and offhighway vehicles we also manufacture for and sell our products to certain tier one vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light and commercial vehicles we operate manufacturing facilities serving customers in the americas europe and asia and are an original equipment supplier to every major automaker in the world 

 

the company’s products fall into two reporting segments engine and drivetrain the engine segment’s products include turbochargers timing chain systems air management emissions systems thermal systems as well as diesel and gas ignition systems the drivetrain segment’s products include allwheel drive transfer cases torque management systems and components and systems for automated transmissions 

 

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

a summary of our operating results for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 is as follows 

 

 

a summary of major factors impacting the company’s net earnings for the year ended december 31 2009 in comparison to 2008 and 2007 is as follows 

 

 26 

 

the company’s earnings loss per diluted share were 023 031 and 245 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the company believes the following table is useful in highlighting nonrecurring or noncomparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share 

 

 

 

the company’s effective tax rate after giving tax effect to the nonrecurring or noncomparable items shown above was 120 230 and 271 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

net sales 

 

the table below summarizes the overall worldwide global light vehicle production percentage changes for 2009 and 2008 

 

worldwide light vehicle year over year increase decrease in production 

 

 

 

 

  

our net sales decrease in 2009 of 247 was worse than the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 137 this is due to the company’s relative higher percentage of business in europe and north america versus asia and certain product mix changes due to scrappage incentives our net sales decrease in 2008 of 12 was slightly better than the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 37 the effect of changing currency rates had a negative impact on the company’s net sales and net earnings in 2009 but had a positive impact on the company’s net sales and net earnings in 2008 the effect of nonus currencies primarily the euro decreased net sales by approximately 169 million and decreased the company’s net earnings by approximately 4 million in 2009 in 2008 nonus currencies primarily the euro increased net sales by approximately 191 million and reduced the company’s net loss by approximately 13 million the year over year decrease in net sales excluding the unfavorable impact of currency was 215 in 2009 the year over year decrease in net sales excluding the favorable impact of currency was 48 in 2008 

consolidated net sales to a single customer including their subsidiaries which exceeded 10 of our total sales were to volkswagen of approximately 22 19 and 15 and to ford of approximately 12 9 and 12 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively both of our reporting segments had significant sales to the customers listed above such sales consisted of a variety of products to a variety of customer locations and regions no other single customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented 

 

outlook 

 

the company is cautiously optimistic about 2010 the company expects global production volumes to be higher in 2010 compared with 2009 however visibility is limited in europe due to uncertainty surrounding consumer demand the impact of expiring governmentsponsored incentive programs and other market dynamics 

 

the company maintains a positive longterm outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy the trends that are driving our longterm growth are expected to continue including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide the increased adoption of automated transmissions in europe and asiapacific and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in both europe and asiapacific as the recovery from current global economic conditions occurs we expect longterm sales and net earnings growth to resume to historical rates 

 

results by reporting segment 

 

the company’s business is comprised of two reporting segments engine and drivetrain these reporting segments are strategic business groups which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems 

 

the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected aftertax return on invested capital “roic” of its business initiatives the roic is comprised of projected earnings before interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “ebit” adjusted for taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required 

 

ebit is considered a “nongaap financial measure” generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap ebit is defined as earnings before restructuring expense goodwill impairment charge interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest “earnings” is intended to mean net earnings as presented in the consolidated statements of operations under gaap 

 

the company believes that ebit is useful to demonstrate the operational profitability of its segments by excluding restructuring expense goodwill impairment charge interest income taxes and noncontrolling interest which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis ebit is also one of the measures used by the company to determine resource allocation within the company although the company believes that ebit enhances understanding of its business and performance it should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than net earnings or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 

the following tables present net sales and segment ebit by segment for the years 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

net sales 

 

 

 

earnings loss before interest and taxes 

 

 

 

the engine segment 2009 net sales were down 253 from 2008 with a 443 decrease in segment ebit over the same period the engine segment decrease was primarily driven by reduced global vehicle production and depressed demand for engine products the segment ebit margin was 76 in 2009 down from 102 in 2008 due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the us and european markets 

 

the engine segment 2008 net sales were up 27 from 2007 with a 55 decrease in segment ebit over the same period the engine segment continued to benefit from asian automaker demand for turbochargers and timing systems european automaker demand for turbochargers timing systems exhaust gas recirculation “egr” valves and diesel engine ignition systems this benefit was offset by lower north american production of light truck and sportutility vehicles the segment ebit margin was 102 in 2008 down from 111 in 2007 which includes the onetime writeoff in 2008 of the excess purchase price allocated to beru’s iprd order backlog and inventory due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the us and european markets and increased costs for raw materials principally steel 

the drivetrain segment 2009 net sales decreased 233 from 2008 with a 1755 decrease in segment ebit over the same period the group was negatively impacted by lower global production of light trucks and suvs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products segment ebit margin was 12 in 2009 down from 03 in the prior year primarily due to lower global production of light trucks and sportutility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products 

 

the drivetrain segment 2008 net sales decreased 108 from 2007 with a 1041 decrease in segment ebit over the same period the group was negatively impacted by lower us production of light trucks and suvs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products segment ebit margin was 03 in 2008 down from 74 in the prior year due to the combined effect of dct product startup cost pressures and lower north american production of light trucks and sportutility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products 

 

corporate is the difference between calculated total consolidated ebit and the total of the segments’ ebit it represents corporate headquarters’ expenses expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments expenses associated with divested operations and equity in affiliates’ earnings this net expense was 1113 million in 2009 600 million in 2008 and 777 million in 2007 the increase in corporate expenses in 2009 is primarily related to a decline in affiliate earnings an increase in pension and other postemployment expenses and an increase in performance related compensation 

 

other factors affecting results of operations 

 

the following table details our results of operations as a percentage of sales 

 

 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 142 159 and 178 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our gross profit decrease in 2009 was due to sales volumes declining faster than our ability to reduce our cost structure cost reduction actions taken in 2009 to reduce our cost structure included headcount reductions global pay cuts selected plant shutdowns and reduced work weeks outside of the us 

 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” as a percentage of net sales were 116 103 and 100 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 2009 sga expenses decreased 831 million or 153 compared to 2008 the 2009 increase in sga as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a 

significant year over year reduction in sales with increased pension and other postemployment expenses and performance related compensation net of salary wage reductions 

 

research and development “rd” is a major component of our sga expenses rd spending net of customer reimbursements was 1552 million or 39 of sales in 2009 compared to 2057 million or 39 of sales in 2008 and 2108 million or 40 of sales in 2007 we currently intend to continue to increase our spending in rd although the growth rate in the future may not necessarily match the rate of our sales growth we also intend to continue to invest in a number of crossbusiness rd programs as well as a number of other key programs all of which are necessary for short and longterm growth our current longterm expectation for rd spending is approximately 40 of sales we intend to maintain our commitment to rd spending while continuing to focus on controlling other sga costs 

 

restructuring expense of 503 million in 2009 and 1275 million in 2008 was in response to declines in global customer production levels customer restructurings and a subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in north america europe and asia and our longterm capacity needs 

 

in the second quarter of 2009 the company took additional restructuring actions the company reduced its north american workforce by approximately 550 people or 12 its european workforce by approximately 150 people or 2 and its asian workforce by approximately 60 people or 3 in the second quarter the net restructuring expense recognized in the second quarter was 90 million for employee termination benefits in addition to employee termination costs the company recorded 363 million of asset impairment and 50 million of other charges in the second quarter of 2009 related to the north american and european restructuring the combined 2009 restructuring expenses of 503 million are broken out by segment as follows engine 272 million drivetrain 197 million and corporate 34 million 

 

included in the second quarter of 2009 asset impairment charge is 223 million related to one of the company’s european locations during the second quarter of 2009 circumstances caused the company to evaluate the long range outlook of the facility using an undiscounted and discounted cash flow model both of which indicated that assets were impaired the company then used a replacement cost technique to determine the fair value of the assets at the facility this reduction of asset value was included in the engine segment 

 

on july 31 2008 the company announced a restructuring of its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing fundamental market shift in the auto industry as a continuation of the company’s third quarter restructuring on december 11 2008 the company announced plans for additional restructuring actions as a result of these third and fourth quarter 2008 restructuring actions the company had reduced its north american workforce by approximately 2400 people or 33 its european workforce by approximately 1600 people or 18 and its asian workforce by approximately 400 people or 17 the restructuring expense recognized for employee termination benefits was 546 million in addition to employee termination costs the company recorded 729 million of asset impairment charges related to the north american and european restructuring the combined restructuring expenses of 1275 million are broken out by segment as follows engine 853 million drivetrain 409 million and corporate 13 million 

 

refer to note 17 “restructuring” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

 

equity in affiliates’ earnings net of tax was 218 million 384 million and 403 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively this line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50 owned japanese joint venture nskwarner and our 326 owned indian joint venture turbo energy limited “tel” the significant reduction to equity in affiliates’ earnings in 2009 is primarily due to lower vehicle production in asia for more discussion of nskwarner see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

interest expense and finance charges were 572 million 388 million and 347 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in 2009 expense over 2008 was primarily due to increased debt levels resulting from the company’s 3738 million convertible debt offering which provided the company increased liquidity the increase in 2008 expense over 2007 expense was primarily due to costs related to acquiring 100 of beru 

the provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate for 2009 of 1034 compared with rates of 2379 in 2008 and 265 in 2007 the effective tax rate of 1034 for 2009 differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to a reduction in us income foreign rates which differ from those in the us the realization of certain business tax credits including rd and us based foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items including equity in affiliates’ earnings 

 

noncontrolling interest net of tax of 94 million decreased by 69 million from 2008 and by 186 million from 2007 the decrease is primarily related to the company’s increased ownership to 100 of beru 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

capitalization 

 

 

 

  

stockholders’ equity increased by 1852 million in 2009 as follows

pension and other post employment benefits 

 

the company’s policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate at december 31 2009 all legal funding requirements had been met the company contributed 393 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009 and 133 million in 2008 the company expects to contribute a total of 10 million to 20 million in 2010 

 

the funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of 2299 million and 2535 million at the end of 2009 and 2008 respectively of these amounts 1311 million and 1109 at the end of 2009 and 2008 respectively were related to plans in germany where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans hence the common practice is that they are unfunded plans 

 

other post employment benefits primarily consist of post employment health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the company’s us operations the company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred other post employment benefits had an unfunded status of 2785 million at the end of 2009 and 3285 million at the end of 2008 the unfunded levels decreased due to the closure of the company’s muncie indiana automotive components plant and changes in certain plan designs 

 

the company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future

other matters 

 

contingencies 

 

in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks see notes 7 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the company’s environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

litigation outcome 

 

in january 2006 dtp a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the court’s affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the thencurrent collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtp’s reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw which did not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of 40 million as a result of the court’s decision 

 

dtp filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the uaw local no 287 and jim barrett and others individually and as representatives of a defendant class on february 26 2009 again seeking the court’s affirmation that dtp will not violate the labor — management relations act or the employment retirement income security act erisa by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans after april 24 2009 certain retirees on behalf of themselves and others filed a mirrorimage action in the united states district court eastern district of michigan southern division on march 11 2009 for which a class has been certified during the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in indiana was dismissed while the action in michigan is continuing at this stage of the litigation the company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome but it is vigorously defending against the suit 

 

environmental 

 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 35 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives and estimated legal fees the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2009 of 210 million the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed 30 million related to any individual site except for the crystal springs site discussed below and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 

 

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the company’s 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged environmental contamination in 2005 the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99 of those claims and the remainder of them have since been dismissed 

 

in 2007 and 2008 four additional lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 340 plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination at this stage of the litigation the company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome but it is vigorously defending against the suits 

 

conditional asset retirement obligations 

 

in march 2005 the fasb issued asc topic 410 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations which requires the company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished the liability exists because the facility will not last forever but it is conditional on future renovations even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition similarly government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use ceases the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers and capacitors when their use ceases and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners and leadbased paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition the company currently has 31 manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items the fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at 13 million as of december 31 2009 and 14 million as of december 31 2008 

 

product liability 

 

like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the company’s involvement is limited because in general these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 the company had approximately 23000 and 27000 pending asbestosrelated product liability claims respectively of the 23000 outstanding claims at december 31 2009 approximately 12000 were pending in just three jurisdictions where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway 

the company’s policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in 2009 of the approximately 5300 claims resolved only 223 42 resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in 2008 of the approximately 17500 claims resolved only 210 12 resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 

 

prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the company’s primary layer insurance coverage and these carriers administered defended settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits this led the company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage since june 2004 secondary layer insurers have paid asbestosrelated litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement to date the company has paid 798 million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers’ reimbursement and has received 212 million in cash from insurers the net outstanding balance of 586 million is expected to be fully recovered of which 230 million is expected to be recovered in 2010 timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to below at december 31 2008 insurers owed 359 million in association with these claims 

 

in addition at december 31 2009 the company has estimated a liability of 499 million for claims asserted but not yet resolved and their related defense costs the company also has a related asset of 499 million to recognize the proceeds receivable from the insurance carriers insurance carrier reimbursement of 100 is expected based on the company’s experience its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to below at december 31 2008 the comparable value of the insurance receivable and accrued liability was 347 million 

 

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows 

 

 

 

the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses if any in excess of those for which it has accrued because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future the allegations in such claims the possible outcomes or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 

 

a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies “cna” against the company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers cna provided the company with both primary and additional layer insurance and in conjunction with other insurers is currently defending and indemnifying the company in its pending asbestosrelated product liability claims the lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the company including whether the available limits exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an “aggregate” basis and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned on august 15 2005 the court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter the interim order has 

the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to timeontherisk with the proration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage appeals of the interim order were denied however the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestosrelated claims the company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestosrelated product claims as such the company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities 

 

although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels due to the encapsulated nature of the products the company’s experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past and the company’s significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing management does not believe that asbestosrelated product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations these policies require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the price is not fixed over the life of the agreements 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

in accordance with asc topic 360 the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review such events and circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in market volumes or project life or a loss of a major customer application ie a “triggering event” the company’s impairment review is performed at each manufacturing assembly and technical site by local and business unit management using data that is the basis for the company’s annual budget or forecast on an interim basis and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments if the operating site review reflects that a triggering event has occurred the assets identified by the operating location as potentially impaired will be reviewed by management the review will determine if a current or future alternative use exists for additional customer applications or if redeployment of the assets to any of the company’s other operating sites around the world is justified if a future alternative use can not be identified a test for recoverability is performed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified the test compares projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of a product line or a specific customer application or asset grouping as applicable if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment management will perform a test based on the discounted future cash flows the discount rate used for impairment testing is the same for both longlived assets and goodwill if the carrying value of the longlived assets is considered impaired based on the discounted future cash flow analysis an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived assets exceeds their fair value in certain cases management will consider estimates obtained from third parties as evidence of the assets’ fair value including among other factors the assets’ orderly liquidation value management believes that the 

estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions with respect to future volumes program project life or future asset use in addition to future cash flows underlying these estimates could affect the company’s fair value evaluations 

 

due to the sudden decline in the global automotive markets in 2008 and 2009 the company reviewed the carrying value of its longlived assets as a result of these reviews the company recognized 363 million and 729 million in impairment of longlived assets ie plant and equipment as part of restructuring expenses in 2009 and 2008 respectively the 2009 and 2008 impairment charges are broken out by segment as follows 

 

 

 

further declines in the industry could result in additional impairment charges on the company’s remaining property plant and equipment balance of 14903 million and amortized intangible assets balance of 1112 million at december 31 2009 

 

see note 17 “restructuring” and note 9 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company’s 2009 and 2008 impairment of longlived assets and a discussion of marketbased measurements 

 

goodwill 

 

the company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units or more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review 

 

the company’s goodwill impairment review utilizes the “twostep impairment test” required under asc topic 350 which requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the basis of our goodwill impairment analysis is the company’s annual budget and longrange plan “lrp” the annual budget and lrp include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments as part of the projection we assumed the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication on average including fundamental industry growth of the future performance of the business beyond the five year period into perpetuity as the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty we also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our business units are reasonable different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the primary assumptions affecting the company’s december 31 2009 goodwill impairment review are as follows 

 

  

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company’s analysis the following table illustrates the sensitivity to an 

increase in our discount rate and decrease in our operating income margin assumptions as it would have reduced the company’s goodwill of 10614 million as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 

 

environmental accrual 

 

we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability management’s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability including conditional asset retirement obligations for 2009 is between approximately 20 million and 40 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range at the end of 2009 our total accrued environmental liability was 223 million which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under asc topic 410 of 13 million 

 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 

 

product warranty 

 

the company provides warranties on some of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual our warranty provision over the last three years and as a percentage of net sales has trended as follows 

 

 

 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change as a percentage of sales in the assumed warranty trend on the company’s accrued warranty liability 

 

 

 

at the end of 2009 our total accrued warranty liability was 617 million the accrual is represented as 325 million in current liabilities and 292 million in noncurrent liabilities on our balance sheet 

 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranty 

 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances 

 

the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers’ compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization we 

estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

 

pension and other post employment defined benefits 

 

the company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 

 

using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions the company’s defined benefit pension and nonpension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 715 disability early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 712 

 

the determination of the company’s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits such as retiree health care is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts certain of the more important assumptions are described in note 11 “retirement benefit plans” to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k and include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets rates of increase in compensation and health care costs retirement rates mortality rates and other factors the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” 

 

in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods the primary assumptions affecting the company’s accounting for employee benefits under asc topics 712 and 715 as of december 31 2009 are as follows 

 

  

actual return on us pension assets for 2009 2008 and 2007 were 253 257 and 39 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 750 in 2009 and 875 for 2008 and 2007 

 

actual return on uk pension assets for 2009 2008 and 2007 were 151 187 and 64 respectively compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 750 in 2009 and 725 for 2008 and 2007 

 

 42 

 

  

while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company’s pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 

 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and nonus pension plans on its 2010 pretax pension expense 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s us opeb interest expense 

 

 

 

the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company’s total 2010 us opeb expense is expected to be negligible as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 

 

the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a onepercentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the company’s opeb obligation and service and interest cost 

 

 

 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company’s retirement benefit plans 

 

income taxes 

 

the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents foreign net operating losses and us based foreign tax credits for which utilization is uncertain management judgment 

is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic 605 the company’s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2009 the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

this adoption required all issued authoritative literature to be disclosed using codification sections authoritative literature has been referenced within our 2009 report on form 10k under these new codification sections new standards not yet codified have been referenced as issued and will be updated when codified 

qualitative and quantitive disclosure about market risk 

 

the company’s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at the end of 2009 the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 620 of total debt including the impact of the interest rate swaps our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 15 million in 2009 and 21 million in 2008 

 

we also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10 change in interest rates as of december 31 2009 the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately 220 million if interest rates decreased and would decrease by approximately 200 million if interest rates increased our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves the model therefore does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between shortterm and longterm interest rates interest rate sensitivity at december 31 2008 measured in a similar manner was slightly more than at december 31 2009 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps such nonus dollar debt was 3031 million as of december 31 2009 and 4958 million as of december 31 2008 we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2009 the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 38 million and 175 million respectively of which 36 million in gains and 145 million in losses mature in less than one year as of december 31 2009 05 million in gains and 23 million in losses did not qualify for deferral 

commodity price risk 

 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2009 the company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of 148 million as of december 31 2009 the company was holding commodity derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 84 million and 01 million respectively all of which mature in less than one year

the company has led the globalization of today’s dct technology for over ten years following the development of its dct technology in the 1990s the company established its industryleading position in europe in 2003 with the production launch of its awardwinning dualtronic ® innovations with vwaudi in 2006 the company was awarded the first dualclutch program in china with saic in 2007 the company launched its first dualclutch technology application in a japanese transmission with nissan 

 

the company has announced programs with customers that include vw audi bugatti saic and nissan in addition to getrag dct programs with five additional global automakers also the company is working on over 20 programs with oems around the world borgwarner dualtronic technology provides both better fuelefficiency and a great driving experience enabling a conventional manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when a single clutch manual transmission shifts gears 

 

in conventional automatic transmissions there has been a global market trend from four and five speeds to six seven and even eight speed transmissions transmissions with more speeds improve fuel economy and vehicle performance and offer growth opportunities 

 

in 2006 the drivetrain group acquired the highpressure solenoid product lines of eaton corporation among these solenoids are those used in amts amts are a growing niche of the entrylevel citycar and light commercialvehicle segments in europe and some asian markets high pressure control systems are also serving a growing share of the dct market segment 

the drivetrain group’s torque management products include rearwheel drive “rwd”allwheel drive “awd” transfer case systems fwdawd electromagnetic coupling systems and advanced products the company’s focus is on electronically controlled active torque management devices and systems for their vehicle dynamics fuel economy and stability benefits additional torque management products include synchronizer rings and systems for application in manual automated manual and dct 

 

transfer cases are installed primarily on lighttrucks sportutility vehicles “suv”s rearwheel drive based crossover utility vehicles “cuv”s and passenger cars a transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions sales of rearwheel drive based transfer cases and components have declined to approximately 7 9 and 10 of the company’s total revenues for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

the company is involved in the fwdawd market with electromagnetic couplings that use electronically controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels instantly as traction is required nextrac ® is our latest product innovation that produces outstanding stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy nextrac launched in 2008 on the hyundai santa fe tucson and kia sportage 

 

with the trend toward vehicle electrification gaining momentum the company is also applying its years of expertise to deliver robust and highly efficient single and multiple speed electric gear reduction solutions for hybrids and electric vehicles 

 

joint ventures 

 

as of december 31 2008 the company had 10 joint ventures in which it had a lessthan100 ownership interest results from the six ventures in which the company is the majority owner are consolidated as part of the company’s results results from the four ventures in which the company’s effective ownership interest is 50 or less were reported by the company using the equity method of accounting 

 

management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with the company’s respective joint venture partners certain information concerning the company’s joint ventures is set forth below 

 

 

 

  

financial information about geographic areas 

 

refer to note 21 “reporting segments and related information” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas 

 

approximately 72 of the company’s consolidated sales for 2008 were outside the united states including exports however a portion of such sales was to oems headquartered outside the united states that produce vehicles that are in turn exported to the united states 

 

customers 

 

approximately 72 of the company’s total sales in 2008 were for lightvehicle applications with the remaining 28 of the company’s sales to a diversified group of commercial truck bus construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers and to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts 

 

for the most recent threeyear period the company’s worldwide sales to the following customers were approximately as follows 

 

 

 

daimler divested chrysler in 2007 no other single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented 

 

the company’s automotive products are generally sold directly to oems substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts longterm supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the oems the company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the oems 

 

sales and marketing 

 

each of the company’s business units within its two reporting segments has its own sales function account executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve specific oem customers for one or more of a business unit’s products our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with oem purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with oems account executives are able to identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of our customer’s needs and our products and design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with the customers 

in addition the sales and marketing employees of our engine segment and drivetrain segment often work together to explore crossdevelopment opportunities for the business units the development of dualtronic the company’s wetclutch and controlsystem technology for a newconcept automated transmission is an example of a successful collaboration 

 

seasonality 

 

the company’s business is moderately seasonal because the company’s largest north american customers typically halt vehicle production for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december additionally customers in europe and asia typically shut down vehicle production during portions of july or august and one week in the fourth quarter accordingly the company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those practices 

 

research and development 

 

the company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at the segment level this advanced engineering function looks to leverage electronics and the company’s expertise across product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized a venture capital fund that was created by the company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses is managed by this function 

 

in addition each of the company’s operating segments has its own research and development “rd” organization the company has approximately 800 employees including engineers mechanics and technicians engaged in rd activities at facilities worldwide the company also operates testing facilities such as prototype measurement and calibration life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories 

 

by working closely with the oems and anticipating their future product needs the company’s rd personnel conceive design develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems rd personnel also work to improve current products and production processes the company believes its commitment to rd will allow it to obtain new orders from its oem customers 

 

the following table presents the company’s gross and net expenditures on rd activities 

 

 

 

the company’s net rd expenditures are included in the selling general and administrative expenses of the consolidated statements of operations customer reimbursements are netted against gross rd expenditures upon billing of services performed the company has contracts with several customers at the company’s various rd locations no such contract exceeded 60 million in any of the years presented 

 

patents and licenses 

 

the company has approximately 3800 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others while it considers its patents on the whole to be important the company does not consider any single patent any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the company’s business groups individually the expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operating results the company owns numerous trademarks some of which are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate 

 

the company owns the “borgwarner” and “borgwarner automotive” trade names and housemarks and variations thereof which are material to the company’s business 

competition 

 

the company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company price quality delivery technological innovation application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition 

 

the company’s major competitors by product type follow 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products although these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers the oems could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates 

 

for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies also see item 1a risk factors 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 13800 salaried and hourly employees as compared with approximately 17700 employees at december 31 2007 of which approximately 4100 were us employees approximately 13 of the company’s us workforce is unionized the hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory 

our two domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our muncie indiana plant and our ithaca and cortland new york facilities the muncie agreement expires on april 24 2009 the agreement covering the new york facilities expires in september 2012 

 

raw materials 

 

continuing a trend which began in 2004 several raw materials used in the company’s products hit record pricing levels in the second quarter of 2008 including steel aluminum copper resins and certain alloying elements this was due to a host of supply and demand factors 

 

despite these challenges the company used a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of inflationary prices and supply shortages the company formed a global procurement organization to accelerate cost reductions purchases from lower cost regions risk mitigation efforts and collaborative buying activities in addition the company used longterm contracts cost sharing arrangements design changes customer buy programs and hedging instruments to help control costs the company intends to use similar measures in 2009 and beyond refer to note 11 “financial instruments” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for information related to the company’s hedging activities 

 

for 2009 the company believes that its supplies of raw materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity 

 

environmental regulation and proceedings 

 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 35 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives and estimated legal fees the company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2008 of 119 million the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed 34 million related to any individual site and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 

 

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the company’s 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants alleged 

personal injury and property damage in 2005 the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99 of the then known personal injury and property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental contamination those settlements involved payments by the company of 285 million in the second half of 2005 and 157 million in the first quarter of 2006 in exchange for among other things dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits 

 

in december 2007 a lawsuit was filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 209 plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination in august 2008 two similar lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 100 plaintiffs and 30 plaintiffs respectively alleging personal injury related to the alleged environmental contamination given the early stage of the litigation the company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome but its current intent is to vigorously defend against the suits 

 

conditional asset retirement obligations 

 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 “fin 47” which requires the company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished the liability exists because the facility will not last forever but it is conditional on future renovations even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition similarly government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks “usts” and above ground storage tanks “asts” when their use ceases the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl “pcb” transformers and capacitors when their use ceases and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners and leadbased paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition the company currently has 32 manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items the fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at 14 million as of december 31 2008 and 10 million as of december 31 2007

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business including its financial performance financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

 

our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns 

 

automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences further economic decline that results in further significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers 

 

we have initiated steps to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements further significant declines in the automotive industry and financial declines and restructurings by our significant customers may make it necessary to take further restructuring actions and charges 

 

we are dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments 

 

some of our products in particular turbochargers are currently used primarily in diesel passenger cars and commercial vehicles any significant reduction in production in these market segments or loss of business in these market segments could have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers 

 

we face strong competition 

 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us original equipment manufacturer customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our businesses 

we are under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce the prices of our products 

 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs including costs of products we supply although original equipment manufacturers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major original equipment manufacturer customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these original equipment manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply we believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive however we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain our gross margins on product sales to original equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will continue 

 

annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our original equipment manufacturer customers is limited with cost recovery often less than 100 and often on a delayed basis we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs 

 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

 

all three of our primary north american customers ford chrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic original equipment manufacturers’ dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original equipment manufacturers’ facilities similarly a majority of our global customers’ operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

part of our labor force is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages 

 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 13 of our us workforce was unionized our two domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our muncie indiana plant and our ithaca and cortland new york facilities the muncie agreement expires on april 24 2009 the agreement covering the new york facilities expires in september 2012 the hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized while we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials we believe that our business operations and activities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental health and safety laws however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result furthermore through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future 

we have contingent liabilities related to environmental product warranties regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws as a result as of december 31 2008 we may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 35 of these sites 

 

we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability management’s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability including conditional asset retirement obligations for 2008 is between 124 million and 261 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range based on information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental liabilities including our conditional asset retirement obligation under fin 47 with a total balance of 14 million at december 31 2008 we currently expect the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the next three to five years 

 

we provide warranties to our customers for some of our products under these warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our financial statement based upon information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for product warranties of 821 million at december 31 2008 

 

we are also party to or have an obligation to defend a party to various legal proceedings including those described in note 15 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include but not be limited to commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers intellectual property matters and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate 

 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

 

we have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating revenues at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and d the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively 

 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions and countries including north america europe china india south korea japan and brazil and sell our products worldwide for 2008 approximately 68 of our sales were outside north america consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates limitations on the repatriation of funds changing economic conditions social unrest political instability and disputes and international terrorism compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and expensive see note 21 “reporting 

segments and related information” to consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

 

we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments it could adversely affect our business 

 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits 

 

the automotive industry like other industries continues to be impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits to partially address this impact we announced adjustments to certain retiree medical and pension plans to be effective january 1 2009 see note 12 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

certain defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently underfunded 

 

we sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments additionally if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations or if other actuarial assumptions are modified our required contributions may be higher than we expect see note 12 “retirement benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k 

 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business 

 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

additionally we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our business 

 

we rely on sales to major customers 

 

we rely on sales to original equipment manufacturers around the world supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the company in working capital plant and equipment some of our customers are rated by the credit rating agencies as below investment grade the loss of sales to a major customer due to any of a variety of factors including nonrenewal of purchase orders the customer’s financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons could adversely affect our business 

 

furthermore some of our sales are concentrated our worldwide sales in 2008 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 19 and 9 respectively of our 2008 consolidated sales 

 

suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and have a material effect on our business 

 

unfavorable industry conditions such as lower production volumes credit tightness changes in foreign currencies raw material commodity transportation and energy price escalation drastic changes in consumer preferences and others could adversely affect our supply chain and sometimes with little advanced notice these conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks in certain instances it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business on occasion we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines while we have taken definite actions to mitigate these factors we can not predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business 

we continue to face highly volatile commodity costs used in the production of our products 

 

the company uses a variety of commodities including steel nickel copper aluminum plastic resins other raw materials and energy and materials purchased in various forms such as castings powder metal forgings stampings and bar stock increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures or by including a material passthrough provision in our customer contracts wherever possible customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any materials increases the continuation of this practice would adversely affect our business 

 

from time to time commodity prices may also fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions the same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers 

 

we could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers 

 

in an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services we have been rationalizing our supply base as a result we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products the company selects suppliers based on total value including total landed price quality delivery and technology taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition we expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations 

 

however there can be no assurance that capacity limitations labor unrest weather emergencies commercial disputes government actions riots wars sabotage nonconforming parts acts of terrorism “acts of god” or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations this would adversely affect our customer relations and business 

 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

 

changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted the tightening in the credit markets and the low level of liquidity in many financial markets due to the current turmoil in the financial and banking industries could also affect our access to the debt capital markets in the event the company is unable to access the debt capital markets we would have the ability to draw on our 600 million revolving credit facility however this agreement is scheduled to expire july 22 2009

a summary of major factors impacting the company’s net earnings for the year ended december 31 2008 in comparison to 2007 and 2006 is as follows 

 

 25 

 

the company’s earnings loss per diluted share were 031 245 and 183 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the company believes the following table is useful in highlighting nonrecurring or noncomparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share 

 

 

 

the company’s effective tax rate after giving tax effect to the nonrecurring or noncomparable items shown above was 230 271 and 260 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

net sales 

 

the table below summarizes the overall worldwide global light vehicle production percentage changes for 2008 and 2007 

 

worldwide light vehicle year over year increase decrease in production 

 

 

 

 

  

our net sales decrease in 2008 of 12 was slightly better than the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 37 our net sales increase in 2007 of 162 was strong in light of the estimated worldwide market production increase of 50 the effect of changing currency rates had a positive impact on the company’s net sales and net earnings in 2008 and 2007 the effect of nonus currencies primarily the euro increased net sales by 1910 million and reduced the company’s net loss by 130 million in 2008 in 2007 nonus currencies primarily the euro added 2621 million to net sales and 152 million to net earnings the year over year decrease in net sales excluding the favorable impact of currency was 48 in 2008 the year over year increase in net sales excluding the favorable impact of currency was 105 in 2007

outlook 

 

the company is very cautious about 2009 the recent crisis in the financial sector and deteriorating global economic conditions have increased uncertainty about automotive vehicle sales in every geographic region of the world the company expects the unprecedented current global economic environment to continue to affect nearterm results and to create difficult conditions through 2009 

 

the company maintains a positive longterm outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy the trends that are driving our longterm growth are expected to continue including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide the increased adoption of automated transmissions in europe and asiapacific and the move to chain engine timing systems in both europe and asiapacific 

 

the impact of nonus currencies is currently expected to be a decline in 2009 when the recovery from current global economic conditions occur we expect longterm sales and net earnings growth to resume to historical rates 

 

results by reporting segment 

 

the company’s business is comprised of two reporting segments engine and drivetrain these segments are strategic business groups which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems 

 

the company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected aftertax return on invested capital “roic” of its business initiatives the roic is comprised of projected earnings before interest and taxes “ebit” adjusted for taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required 

 

ebit is considered a “nongaap financial measure” generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap ebit is defined as earnings before interest taxes and minority interest “earnings” is intended to mean net earnings as presented in the consolidated statements of operations under gaap 

 

the company believes that ebit is useful to demonstrate the operational profitability of its segments by excluding interest and taxes which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis ebit is also one of the measures used by the company to determine resource allocation within the company although the company believes that ebit enhances understanding of its business and performance it should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than net earnings or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 

 

the following tables present net sales and segment ebit by segment for the years 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

net sales 

 

 

earnings before interest and taxes 

 

 

 

the engine segment 2008 net sales were up 27 from 2007 with a 55 decrease in segment ebit over the same period the engine segment continued to benefit from asian automaker demand for turbochargers and timing systems european automaker demand for turbochargers timing systems exhaust gas recirculation “egr” valves and diesel engine ignition systems this benefit was offset by lower north american production of light truck and sportutility vehicles the segment ebit margin was 102 in 2008 down from 111 in 2007 which includes the onetime writeoff in 2008 of the excess purchase price allocated to beru’s iprd order backlog and inventory due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the us and european markets and increased costs for raw materials principally steel 

 

the engine segment 2007 net sales were up 192 from 2006 with a 143 increase in segment ebit over the same period the engine segment continued to benefit from asian automaker demand for turbochargers and timing systems european automaker demand for turbochargers timing systems exhaust gas recirculation “egr” valves and diesel engine ignition systems the continued rollout of its variable cam timing systems with general motors highvalue v6 engines stronger egr valve sales in north america and higher turbocharger and thermal products sales due to stronger global commercial vehicle production the segment ebit margin was 111 in 2007 down from 116 in 2006 which includes the onetime writeoff in 2007 of the excess purchase price allocated to beru’s iprd order backlog and inventory due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the us market and increased costs for raw materials principally nickel 

 

the drivetrain segment 2008 net sales decreased 108 from 2007 with a 1041 decrease in segment ebit over the same period the group was negatively impacted by lower us production of light trucks and suvs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products segment ebit margin was 03 in 2008 down from 74 in the prior year due to the combined effect of dct product startup cost pressures and lower north american production of light trucks and sportutility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products 

 

the drivetrain segment 2007 net sales increased 94 from 2006 with a 304 increase in segment ebit over the same period the segment continued to benefit from growth outside of north america including the continued ramp up of dualclutch transmission and torque transfer product sales in europe in the us the group was negatively impacted by lower production of light trucks and suvs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products segment ebit margin was 74 in 2007 up from 62 in the prior year due to the benefits of restructuring in its north american operations and growth outside of the us 

 

corporate is the difference between calculated total company ebit and the total of the segments’ ebit it represents corporate headquarters’ expenses expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments and 

equity in affiliates’ earnings this net expense was 529 million in 2008 710 million in 2007 and 612 million in 2006 

 

other factors affecting results of operations 

 

the following table details our results of operations as a percentage of sales 

 

 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 159 178 and 185 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our gross profit decrease in 2008 is due to unfavorable product mix as a result of the sudden decline in the north american and european automotive markets including a 158 decrease in light truck and suv production in north america the company has restructured its north american and european operations in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 to align the company’s workforce with forecasted production 

 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” as a percentage of net sales were 103 100 and 109 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the 2008 increase in sga as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to 80 million of amortization for the recognition of the remaining 178 of the fair value of beru 33 million of the amortization recognized in the second quarter of 2008 is for the immediate write off of in process rd and order backlog the remaining 47 million increase is amortization on other intangible assets the company also recorded an increase in bad debt expense of 27 million in 2008 related to a decline in the financial condition of certain customers 

 

research and development “rd” is a major component of our sga expenses rd spending net of customer reimbursements was 2057 million or 39 of sales in 2008 compared to 2108 million or 40 of sales in 2007 and 1877 million or 41 of sales in 2006 we currently intend to continue to increase our spending in rd although the growth rate in the future may not necessarily match the rate of our sales growth we also intend to continue to invest in a number of crossbusiness rd programs as well as a number of other key programs all of which are necessary for short and longterm growth our current longterm expectation for rd spending is approximately 40 of sales we intend to maintain our commitment to rd spending while continuing to focus on controlling other sga costs 

 

restructuring expense of 1275 million in 2008 and 847 million in 2006 was in response to declines in global customer production levels customer restructurings and a subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in north america europe and asia in 2008 only and our longterm capacity needs 

 

on july 31 2008 the company announced a restructuring of its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing fundamental market shift in the auto industry as a continuation of the company’s third quarter restructuring on december 11 2008 the company announced plans for additional restructuring actions as a 

result of these third and fourth quarter restructuring actions the company has reduced its north american workforce by approximately 2400 people or 33 its european workforce by approximately 1600 people or 18 and its asian workforce by approximately 400 people or 17 the restructuring expense recognized for employee termination benefits is 546 million of which 103 million was paid out in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 the remaining liability will be paid out by the middle of 2010 in addition to employee termination costs the company recorded 729 million of asset impairment charges related to the north american and european restructuring the combined restructuring expenses of 1275 million are broken out by segment as follows engine 853 million drivetrain 409 million and corporate 13 million refer to note 19 “restructuring” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

 

on september 22 2006 the company announced the reduction of its north american workforce by approximately 850 people or 13 spread across its 19 operations in the us canada and mexico this third quarter reduction of the north american workforce addressed an immediate need to adjust employment levels to meet customer restructurings and significantly lower production schedules going forward in addition to employee related costs of 67 million the company recorded 48 million of asset impairment charges related to the north american restructuring the third quarter restructuring expenses of 115 million broken out by segment were as follows engine 73 million drivetrain 36 million and corporate 06 million 

 

during the fourth quarter 2006 the company evaluated the competitiveness of its north american facilities as well as its longterm capacity needs as a result the company will be closing the drivetrain plant in muncie indiana and has adjusted the carrying values of other assets primarily related to its fourwheel drive transfer case product line production activity at the muncie facility is scheduled to cease no later than the expiration of the current labor contract in april 24 2009 as a result of the fourth quarter restructuring the company recorded employee related costs of 148 million asset impairments of 516 million and pension curtailment expense of 68 million the fourth quarter restructuring expenses of 732 million broken out by segment were as follows engine 59 million and drivetrain 673 million 

 

other income was 31 million 68 million and 75 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the 2008 income was comprised primarily of interest income offset by the realization of a loss on the sale of a product line and other asset disposals the 2007 income was comprised primarily of interest income the 2006 income was comprised primarily of a 48 million gain from a previous divestiture and 32 million of interest income 

 

equity in affiliates’ earnings net of tax was 384 million 403 million and 359 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively this line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50 owned japanese joint venture nskwarner and our 326 owned indian joint venture turbo energy limited “tel” for more discussion of nskwarner see note 6 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

interest expense and finance charges were 388 million 347 million and 402 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in 2008 expense over 2007 expense was primarily due to costs related to beru’s dpta the decrease in 2007 expense over 2006 expense was primarily due to reduced debt levels 

 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate for 2008 of 2379 compared with rates of 265 in 2007 and 120 in 2006 the effective tax rate of 2379 for 2008 differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to the nondeductibility of the 1568 million impairment charge in 2008 related to beru goodwill a reduction in us income foreign rates which differ from those in the us the realization of certain business tax credits including rd and foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items including equity in affiliates’ earnings if the effects of tax accrual changes and the company’s third quarter 135 million valuation allowance are not taken into account the company’s effective tax rate associated with its ongoing business operations was 230 this rate was lower than the 2007 tax rate for ongoing operations of 271 primarily due to the decline in us earnings 

 

minority interest net of tax of 163 million decreased by 117 million from 2007 and by 100 million from 2006 the decrease is primarily related to the company’s dpta with beru giving borgwarner full control of beru 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

capitalization

in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims actions and complaints including matters involving warranty claims intellectual property claims general liability and various other risks see notes 8 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or if not what the impact might be the company’s environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below the company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

litigation outcome 

 

in january 2006 borgwarner diversified transmission products inc “dtp” a subsidiary of the company filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implements workers of america “uaw” local no 287 and gerald poor individually and as the representative of a defendant class dtp sought the court’s affirmation that dtp did not violate the labormanagement relations act or the employee retirement income security act by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april 1 2006 and october 1 2006 prior to the expiration of the current collective bargaining agreements on september 10 2008 the court found that dtp’s reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw which does not expire until april 24 2009 thus the amendments were untimely in 2008 the company recorded a charge of 40 million as a result of the court’s decision 

 

the company has communicated its plan to reduce the level of benefits provided to the retirees to make them comparable to other company retiree benefit plans the change will be effective following expiration of the health insurance agreement in april 24 2009 

environmental 

 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 35 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives and estimated legal fees the company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2008 of 119 million the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed 34 million related to any individual site and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 

 

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the company’s 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage in 2005 the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99 of the then known personal injury and property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental contamination those settlements involved payments by the company of 285 million in the second half of 2005 and 157 million in the first quarter of 2006 in exchange for among other things dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits 

 

in december 2007 a lawsuit was filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 209 plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination in august 2008 two similar lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 100 plaintiffs and 30 plaintiffs respectively alleging personal injury related to the alleged environmental contamination given the early stage of the litigation the company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome but its current intent is to vigorously defend against the suits 

 

conditional asset retirement obligations 

 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 “fin 47” which requires the company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished the liability exists because the facility will not last forever but it is 

conditional on future renovations even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition similarly government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks “usts” and above ground storage tanks “asts” when their use ceases the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl “pcb” transformers and capacitors when their use ceases and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners and leadbased paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition the company currently has 32 manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items the fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at 14 million as of december 31 2008 and 10 million as of december 31 2007 

 

product liability 

 

like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury actions we believe that the company’s involvement is limited because in general these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos the nature of the fibers the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the company had approximately 27000 and 42000 pending asbestosrelated product liability claims respectively of the 27000 outstanding claims at december 31 2008 approximately 16000 are pending in just three jurisdictions where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway 

 

the company’s policy is to aggressively defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestosrelated product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers in 2008 of the approximately 17500 claims resolved only 210 12 resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company in 2007 of the approximately 4400 claims resolved only 194 44 resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 

 

prior to june 2004 the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the company’s primary layer insurance coverage and these carriers administered defended settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement in june 2004 primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits this led the company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage since june 2004 secondary layer insurers have paid asbestosrelated litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement to date the company has paid 501 million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers’ reimbursement and has received 142 million in cash from insurers the outstanding balance of 359 million is expected to be fully recovered timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to below at december 31 2007 insurers owed 206 million in association with these claims 

 

at december 31 2008 the company has an estimated liability of 347 million for future claims resolutions with a related asset of 347 million to recognize the insurance proceeds receivable by the company for estimated losses related to claims that have yet to be resolved insurance carrier reimbursement of 100 is expected based on the company’s experience its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to below at december 31 2007 the comparable value of the insurance receivable and accrued liability was 396 million 

the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows 

 

 

 

the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses if any in excess of those for which it has accrued because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future the allegations in such claims the possible outcomes or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 

 

a declaratory judgment action was filed in january 2004 in the circuit court of cook county illinois by continental casualty company and related companies “cna” against the company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers cna provided the company with both primary and additional layer insurance and in conjunction with other insurers is currently defending and indemnifying the company in its pending asbestosrelated product liability claims the lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the company including whether the available limits exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an “aggregate” basis and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned on august 15 2005 the court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter the interim order has the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to timeontherisk with the proration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage appeals of the interim order were denied however the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestosrelated claims the company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestosrelated product claims as such the company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities 

 

although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels due to the encapsulated nature of the products the company’s experiences in aggressively defending and resolving claims in the past and the company’s significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing management does not believe that asbestosrelated product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap in preparing these financial statements management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations these policies require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain relating to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 

revenue recognition 

 

the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is usually upon shipment of product although the company may enter into longterm supply agreements with its major customers each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the price is not fixed over the life of the agreements 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets whether held for use or disposal including other intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the evaluations significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating longlived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review and ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset the company recognized 729 million and 564 million in impairment of longlived assets as part of restructuring expenses in 2008 and 2006 respectively 

 

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company’s 2006 and 2008 impairment of longlived assets 

 

goodwill 

 

the company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units or when events and circumstances warrant such a review this review utilizes the “twostep impairment test” required under statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangibles and requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows discount rates and growth rates the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty we also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable however different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value the goodwill impairment test was performed in december and september 2008 december 2007 and december 2006 the company recognized goodwill impairment of 1568 million in the engine segment in 2008 and 02 million in the drivetrain segment in 2006 no goodwill impairment was recorded in 2007 

 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 

 

environmental accrual 

 

we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability management’s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability including conditional asset retirement obligations for 2008 is between 124 million and 261 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range at the end of 2008 our total accrued environmental liability was 133 million which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under fin 47 of 14 million 

 

see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 

product warranty 

 

the company provides warranties on some of its products the warranty terms are typically from one to three years provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold these estimates are established using historical information about the nature frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustments to the accrual the accrual is represented in both current and noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet 

 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranty 

 

other loss accruals and valuation allowances 

 

the company has numerous other loss exposures such as customer claims workers’ compensation claims litigation and recoverability of assets establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization we estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods however changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 

 

pension and other post employment defined benefits 

 

the company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees retirees and surviving spouses and dependents the company’s employee defined benefit pension and post employment health care expenses are dependent on management’s assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates health care cost trend rates inflation longterm return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates and other factors health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 

 

the company’s approach to establishing the discount rate is based upon the market yields of highquality corporate bonds with appropriate consideration of each plan’s defined benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities the discount rate assumption is typically rounded up or down to the nearest 25 basis points for each plan as a sensitivity measure for the company’s pension plans a decrease of 25 basis points to the discount rate would increase the company’s 2009 expense by approximately 09 million as for the company’s other post employment benefit plans a decrease of 25 basis points to the discount rate would increase the company’s 2009 expense by approximately 03 million 

 

the company determines its expected return on plan asset assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and the plans’ asset allocation the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans’ invested assets the company’s expected return on assets assumption reflects the asset allocation of each plan for 2009 the company is changing its expected return on us plan assets to 750 from 875 to reflect adjustments made to its targeted asset allocations for sensitivity purposes a 25 basis point decrease in the longterm return on assets would increase the 2009 pension expense by approximately 08 million 

 

the company determines its health care inflation rate for its other post employment benefit plans by evaluating the circumstances surrounding the plan design recent experience and health care economics for sensitivity purposes a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend would increase the 

company’s projected benefit obligation by 189 million at december 31 2008 and would increase the 2009 expense by 14 million 

 

based on the information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions or experience different from that assumed could impact the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 

 

income taxes 

 

the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents foreign operating and other loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary 

 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain the company is regularly under audit by the various applicable tax authorities accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  the company’s federal and certain state income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at december 31 2008 the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions which is included in other noncurrent liabilities nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

 

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes

qualitative and quantitive disclosure about market risk 

 

the company’s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies which include forward contracts the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 

 

we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges at the end of 2008 the amount of net debt with fixed interest rates was 385 of total debt including the impact of the interest rate swaps our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pretax interest expense for 2008 of approximately 21 million and 18 million in 2007 

 

we also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10 change in interest rates as of december 31 2008 the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately 24 million if interest rates decreased and would decrease by approximately 22 million if interest rates increased our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves the model therefore does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between shortterm and longterm interest rates interest rate sensitivity at december 31 2007 measured in a similar manner was slightly less than at december 31 2008 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound the euro the hungarian forint the japanese yen and the south korean won we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps such nonus dollar debt was 4958 million as of december 31 2008 and 4135 million as of december 31 2007 we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing 

economic and political environments in addition the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as of december 31 2008 the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 102 million and 618 million respectively of which 99 million in gains and 363 million in losses mature in less than one year as of december 31 2008 10 million in gains and 82 million in losses did not qualify for deferral 

 

commodity price risk 

 

commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components as of december 31 2008 the company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of 502 million as of december 31 2008 the company was holding commodity derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of 21 million and 163 million respectively of which 10 million in gains and 151 million in losses mature in less than one year

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

the company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the exchange act such as this form 10k is collected recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the securities and exchange commission the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as required under exchange act rule 13a15 the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements management conducted an assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework based on the assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2008 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria the company’s management report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on page 43 of this report 

 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and the chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

 

deloitte and touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 as stated in their report below 

 

changes in internal control 

 

there have been no changes in internal controls over the financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

to the board of directors and stockholders of borgwarner inc 

auburn hills michigan 

 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of borgwarner inc and consolidated subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 of the company and our report dated february 12 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

  the company’s major competitors by product type follow 

 

 

 

  in addition a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products although these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers the oems could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates 

 

 

 

  for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies see also item 1a risk factors

  as of december 31 2007 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 17700 salaried and hourly employees as compared with approximately 17400 employees at december 31 2006 of which approximately 6700 were us employees approximately 25 of the company’s us workforce is unionized the hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory 

  our two most significant domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our muncie indiana plant and our ithaca and cortland new york facilities the muncie agreement expires in april 2009 workers at the new york facilities elected a new union in december 2007 it is expected that both parties will bargain in good faith beginning in the first quarter of 2008 it is our expectation that an agreement will be reached though no assurances can be given 

 

raw materials 

 

  continuing a trend which began in 2004 several raw materials used in the company’s products hit record pricing levels in 2007 including steel copper resins nickel and certain alloying elements this was due to a host of supply and demand factors 

 

  despite these challenges the company used a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of inflationary prices and supply shortages the company formed a global procurement organization to accelerate cost reductions purchases from lower cost regions risk mitigation efforts and collaborative buying activities in addition the company used longterm contracts cost sharing arrangements design changes customer buy programs and hedging instruments to help control costs the company intends to use similar measures in 2008 and beyond see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s summary annual report 

 

  for 2008 the company believes that its supplies of raw materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity 

  environmental regulation and proceedings 

 

  the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at   34 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

 

  the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

 

  based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives and estimated legal fees the company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2007 of 145 million excluding the crystal springs site discussed below for which 49 million has been accrued the company has accrued amounts that do not 

 

 

 

exceed 30 million related to any individual site and management does not believe that the costs related to any of these other individual sites will have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years 

 

  in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that predate the companys 1999 acquisition of kuhlman electric during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage in 2005 the company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99 of the then known personal injury and property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental contamination those settlements involved payments by the company of 285 million in the second half of 2005 and 157 million in the first quarter of 2006 in exchange for among other things the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits 

 

  in december 2007 a lawsuit was filed against kuhlman electric and others including the company on behalf of approximately 209 plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination given the early stage of the litigation the company cannot make any prediction as to the outcome but its current intention is to vigorously defend against the suit

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns 

automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers and our financial position operating results and cash flows 

we are dependent on sportutility vehicle and lighttruck market segments and are affected by decreasing demand in those segments 

 

some of our products in particular fourwheel drive transfer cases are currently used in fourwheel drive systems primarily for sportutility vehicles and lighttrucks any significant reduction in production in this market segment or loss of business in this market segment could have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers and our financial position operating results and cash flows 

we face strong competition 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us original equipment manufacturer customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our businesses 

we are under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce the prices of our products 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs including costs of products we supply although original equipment manufacturers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major original equipment manufacturer customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these original equipment manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply we believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive however we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain our gross margins on product sales to original equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will continue 

annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment in 2007 the combination of price reductions to customers and cost increases for material labor and overhead totaled approximately 136 million to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our original equipment manufacturer customers is limited with cost recovery less than 100 and often on a delayed basis we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs 

 

 

 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

 

all three of our primary north american customers ford chrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic original equipment manufacturers’ dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original equipment manufacturers’ facilities similarly a majority of our global customers’ operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

part of our labor force is unionized 

as of december 31 2007 approximately 25 of our us workforce was unionized our two most significant domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our muncie indiana plant and our ithaca and cortland new york facilities the muncie agreement expires in april 2009 workers at the new york facilities elected a new union in december 2007 it is expected that both parties will bargain in good faith beginning in the first quarter 2008 it is our expectation that an agreement will be reached though no assurances can be given the hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized while we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory a prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our financial position operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials we believe that our business operations and activities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result furthermore through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future 

we believe that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position operating results and cash flows but we cannot assure you that this will always be the case capital expenditures and expenses in 2007 attributable to compliance with environmental laws were not material 

we have contingent liabilities related to environmental product warranties regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws as a result as of december 31 2007 we may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 34   of these sites 

we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability managements estimate of the loss range for 2007 is between 144 million and 251 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range based on information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental liabilities including our conditional asset retirement obligation under fin 47 with a total balance of 155 million at december 31 2007 we currently expect the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the next three to five years 

 

 

we believe that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or operating results either because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared with other potentially responsible parties however we cannot assure you of the ultimate outcome 

we provide warranties to our customers for some of our products under these warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our financial statement 

based upon information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for product warranties of 701 million at december 31 2007 

we are also party to or have an obligation to defend a party to various legal proceedings including those described in note 14 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the companys summary annual report although we believe that none of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future operating results there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter or proceeding 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

we have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating revenues at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers b technology changes rendering our products obsolete c a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and d the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions and countries including north america europe china india south korea japan and brazil and sell our products worldwide for 2007 approximately 66 of our sales were outside north america consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates changing economic conditions and political instability and disputes see note 20 to consolidated financial statements in the companys summary annual report 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments it could adversely affect on our growth and financial performance 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits 

  the automotive industry like other industries continues to be impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits to partially address this impact we announced adjustments to certain retiree medical and pension plans to be effective january 1 2009 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in the companys summary annual report 

  

certain defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently underfunded 

we sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments additionally if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations or if other actuarial assumptions are modified our required contributions may be higher than we expect see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in the companys summary annual report 

 

 

 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance 

additionally we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our financial performance 

we rely on sales to major customers 

 

    our worldwide sales in 2007 to volkswagen and ford constituted approximately 15 and 12 respectively of our 2007 consolidated sales credit rating agencies rate one of these customers below investment grade no other single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated sales in 2007 the loss of a major customer could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

economic distress of suppliers could result in disruption of our operations and have a material effect on our business 

 

  some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity these factors have increased pressure on the industrys supply base as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs lower production volumes and other challenges the company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers the inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could adversely affect our future financial performance 

increase in the cost of raw materials could harm our business 

we use various raw materials in our business such as nickel aluminum magnesium copper plastic resins molybdenum and others the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions in recent years we have experienced increases in freight charges and energy costs as well substantial changes in these prices affect our operating costs and to the extent they cannot be recouped through price increases to our customers could reduce our profitability

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

  the company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the exchange act such as this form 10k is collected recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the securities and exchange commission the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as required under exchange act rule 13a15 the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

  the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements management conducted an assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework based on the assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2007 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria the companys management report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on pages 25  26 of the companys summary annual report and is incorporated herein by this reference 

 

  the company’s management including its chief executive officer and the chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be 

 

 

 

considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

deloitte and touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the company’s consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 as stated in their report below 

 

changes in internal control 

 

  there have been no changes in internal controls over the financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

 

attestation report of the registered public accounting firm 

     

  

 

 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and stockholders of borgwarner inc 

auburn hills michigan 

 

  we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of borgwarner inc and consolidated subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

  a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

  in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

  we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 of the company and our report dated february 14 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the companys changes in its methods of accounting in 2007 for income taxes as a result of adopting fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes

financial information about geographic areas 

 

see note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report for financial information about geographic areas which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

approximately 60 of consolidated sales for 2006 was outside the united states including exports however a portion of such sales was to oems headquartered outside the united states that produce vehicles that are in turn exported to the united states 

 

customers 

 

approximately 75 of the company’s total sales in 2006 was for lightvehicle applications with the remaining 25 of the company’s sales to a diversified group of commercial truck bus construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers and to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts 

 

for the most recent threeyear period the company’s worldwide sales to the following customers were approximately as follows 

 

 

 

the company’s 2006 consolidated sales do not include the approximately 676 million of sales made by the company’s unconsolidated joint ventures if sales from these unconsolidated joint ventures were included in 2006 consolidated sales our worldwide sales to toyota motor corporation and its affiliates would be approximately 7 of consolidated sales 

 

the company’s automotive products are generally sold directly to oems substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts longterm supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by 

the parties deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the oems the company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the oems 

 

sales and marketing 

 

each of the company’s business units within its two operating segments has its own sales function account executives for each business unit are assigned to serve specific oem customers for one or more of a business unit’s products such account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with oem purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with the oems account executives are able to identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of the company’s products and design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with the customers 

 

in addition between the engine segment and the drivetrain segment sales and marketing employees work together to explore crossdevelopment opportunities for the business units the development of dualtronic ®  the company’s wetclutch and controlsystem technology for a newconcept automated transmission is an example of a successful collaboration 

 

seasonality 

 

the company’s business is moderately seasonal because the company’s largest north american customers typically halt vehicle production for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december additionally customers in europe and asia typically shut down vehicle production during portions of july or august and one week in the fourth quarter accordingly the company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those practices 

 

research and development 

 

the company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at the segment level this advanced engineering function looks to leverage electronics and the company’s expertise across product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized a venture capital fund that was created by the company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses is managed by this function 

 

in addition each of the company’s operating segments has its own research and development “rd” organization the company has approximately 800 employees including engineers mechanics and technicians engaged in rd activities at facilities worldwide the company also operates testing facilities such as prototype measurement and calibration life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories 

 

by working closely with the oems and anticipating their future product needs the company’s rd personnel conceive design develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems rd personnel also work to improve current products and production processes the company believes its commitment to rd will allow it to obtain new orders from its oem customers 

 

the following table presents the company’s gross and net expenditures on research and development activities 

 

 

 

the company’s net rd expenditures are included in the selling general and administrative expenses of the consolidated statements of operations customer reimbursements are netted against gross rd 

expenditures upon billing of services performed the company has contracts with several customers at the company’s various rd locations no such contract exceeded 50 million in any of the years presented 

 

patents and licenses 

 

the company has approximately 3800 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others while it considers its patents on the whole to be important the company does not consider any single patent any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the company’s business groups individually the expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operating results the company owns numerous trademarks some of which are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate 

 

the company owns the “borgwarner” and “borgwarner automotive” trade names and housemarks and variations thereof which are material to the company’s business 

 

competition 

 

the company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition 

 

the company’s major competitors include 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products although these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers the oems could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates 

 

for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies see also item 1a risk factors 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 17400 salaried and hourly employees as compared with approximately 17400 employees at december 31 2005 of which approximately 7000 were us employees included in these 17400 employees are approximately 2600 beru employees approximately 23 of the company’s us work force is unionized the hourly workers at the company’s nonus operations are typically unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory 

 

raw materials 

 

continuing a trend which began in 2004 several raw materials used in the company’s products hit record pricing levels including steel copper resins nickel and certain alloying elements this was due to a host of supply and demand factors 

 

despite these challenges the company used a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of inflationary prices and supply shortages the company formed a global procurement organization to accelerate cost reductions purchases from lower cost regions risk mitigation efforts and collaborative buying activities in addition the company used longterm contracts cost sharing arrangements design changes customer buy programs and hedging instruments to help control costs the company intends to use similar measures in 2007 and beyond 

 

for 2007 each of the company’s operating segments believes that its supplies of raw materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity 

 

environmental regulation and proceedings 

 

the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 35 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

 

the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations financial position or cash flows generally this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

 

based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives estimated legal fees and other factors the company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2006 of approximately 20 million excluding the crystal springs site discussed below for which 108 million has been accrued the company has accrued amounts that do not exceed 30 million related to any individual site and management does not believe that the costs related to any of these other individual sites will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition the company expects to pay out substantially all of the accrued environmental liability over the next three to five years 

 

in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation “kuhlman electric” the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities then unknown to the company relating to the past operations of kuhlman electric the liabilities at issue result from the operations of kuhlman 

electric that predate the company’s acquisition of kuhlman electric’s parent company kuhlman corporation in 1999 during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant the company is continuing to work with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary if any historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns 

 

automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers and our financial position and operating results 

 

we are dependent on sportutility vehicle and lighttruck market segments 

 

some of our products in particular fourwheel drive transfer cases are currently used exclusively in fourwheel drive systems for sportutility vehicles and lighttrucks for 2006 for example sales of rearwheel drive transfer cases represented 10 of our total consolidated revenue any significant reduction in production in this market segment or loss of business in this market segment would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers and our financial position and operating results 

 

we face strong competition 

 

we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us original equipment manufacturer customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our businesses 

 

we are under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce the prices of our products 

 

there is substantial and continuing pressure on original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs including costs of products we supply although original equipment manufacturers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major original equipment manufacturer customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these original equipment manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply we believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive however we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain our gross margins on product sales to original equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will continue 

 

annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment in 2006 and 2005 the combination of price reductions to customers and cost increases for material labor and overhead totaled approximately 155 million and 140 million respectively to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our original equipment manufacturer customers is limited with cost recovery less than 100 and often on a delayed basis we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs 

 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

 

all three of our primary north american customers ford daimlerchrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic original equipment manufacturers’ dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original equipment manufacturers’ facilities similarly a majority of our global customers’ operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

 

part of our labor force is unionized 

 

as of december 31 2006 approximately 23 of our us employees was unionized our two most significant domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our muncie indiana plant and our ithaca new york plants the muncie agreement expires in april 2009 and the ithaca agreement expires in october 2008 the hourly employees at certain of our international facilities are also unionized while we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory a prolonged dispute with our employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

 

our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials we believe that our business operations and activities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result furthermore through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future 

 

we believe that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or operating results but we cannot assure you that this will always be the case capital expenditures and expenses in 2006 attributable to compliance with environmental laws were not material 

 

we have contingent liabilities related to environmental product warranties regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

 

we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws as a result as of december 31 2006 we may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 35 of these sites 

 

we work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability management’s estimate of the loss range for 2006 is between 181 million and 295 million we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range based on information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance of 200 million at december 31 2006 we currently expect this amount to be expended over the next three to five years 

 

we believe that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or operating results either because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a 

site are not large or because liability will be shared with other potentially responsible parties however we cannot assure you of the ultimate outcome 

 

we are also party to or have an obligation to defend a party to various legal proceedings including those described in note 15 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report although we believe that none of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future operating results there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter or proceeding 

 

we provide warranties to our customers for some of our products under these warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our financial statement 

 

based upon information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for product warranties of 600 million at december 31 2006 

 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

 

we have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating revenues at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a a significant decrease in the production of sportutility vehicles and lighttrucks high content vehicles for us b the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers c technology changes rendering our products obsolete d a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and e the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively 

 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

 

we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions and countries including north america europe china india south korea japan and brazil and sell our products worldwide for 2006 approximately 60 of our sales were outside north america consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates changing economic conditions and political instability and disputes see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report 

 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

 

we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and financial performance 

 

we are impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits 

 

the automotive industry like other industries continues to be impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post employment benefits to partially address this impact we adjusted certain retiree medical plans effective april 1 2006 to provide certain participating retirees with continued access to group health coverage while reducing our subsidy of the program see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report 

 

certain defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently underfunded 

 

we sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments additionally if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations or if 

other actuarial assumptions are modified our required contributions may be higher than we expect see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report 

 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

 

additionally we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we rely on sales to several major customers 

 

our worldwide sales in 2006 to ford motor company volkswagen daimlerchrysler and general motors corporation constituted approximately 13 13 11 and 9 respectively of our 2006 consolidated sales these four customers constituted approximately 46 of our 2006 sales credit rating agencies rate two of these customers below investment grade the corresponding percentages of sales to these customers for 2005 were 16 13 12 and 9 no other single customer accounted for more that 10 of our consolidated sales in 2006 or 2005 

 

our 2006 consolidated sales do not include the approximately 676 million of sales made by our unconsolidated joint ventures if sales from these unconsolidated joint ventures were included in 2006 consolidated sales our worldwide sales to toyota motor corporation and its affiliates would be approximately 7 of consolidated sales 

 

economic distress of suppliers could result in disruption of our operations and have a material effect on our business 

 

some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity these factors have increased pressure on the industry’s supply base as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs lower production volumes and other challenges the company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers the inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could materially affect future operating results

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

the company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the exchange act such as this form 10k is collected recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the securities and exchange commission the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as required under exchange act rule 13a15 the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f the company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements management conducted an assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework based on the assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2006 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report below 

 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and the chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls 

can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

 

changes in internal control 

 

there have been no changes in internal controls over the financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

to the board of directors and stockholders of borgwarner inc 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that borgwarner inc and consolidated subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 of the company and our report dated february 16 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the company’s changes in its methods of accounting in 2006 for employee stockbased compensation as a result of adopting sfas no 123r share based payment and for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans as a result of adopting sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans

8 customers 

  approximately 73 of the company’s total sales in 2005 were for light vehicle applications with the remaining 27 of the company’s sales to a diversified group of commercial truck bus construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers and to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts 

  for the most recent threeyear period the company’s worldwide sales to the following customers were approximately as follows 

   approximately 55 of consolidated sales for 2005 were outside the united states including exports however a portion of such sales were to oems headquartered outside the united states that produce vehicles that are in turn exported to the united states see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company’s annual report 

  the company’s automotive products are generally sold directly to oems substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts longterm supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the oems the company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the oems 

sales and marketing 

  each of the company’s business units within its two operating segments has its own sales function account executives for each business unit are assigned to serve specific oem customers for one or more of a business unit’s products such account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with oem purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with the oems account executives are able to identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of the company’s products and design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities and as a key interface with the customers 

  in addition between the engine segment and the drivetrain segment sales and marketing employees work together to explore crossdevelopment opportunities for the business units the development of dualtronic tm  the company’s wetclutch and controlsystem technology for a newconcept automated transmission is an example of a successful collaboration 

seasonality 

  the company’s business is moderately seasonal because the company’s largest north american customers typically halt vehicle production for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december additionally customers in europe and asia typically shut down vehicle production during portions of july or august and one week in the fourth quarter accordingly the company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those practices 

research and development 

  the company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at the segment level this advanced engineering function looks to leverage electronics and the company’s expertise across product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized a venture capital fund that was created by the company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses is managed by this function 

9   in addition each of the company’s operating segments has its own research and development “rd” organization the company has 811 employees including engineers mechanics and technicians engaged in rd activities at facilities worldwide the company also operates testing facilities such as prototype measurement and calibration life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories 

  by working closely with the oems and anticipating their future product needs the company’s rd personnel conceive design develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems rd personnel also work to improve current products and production processes the company believes its commitment to rd will allow it to obtain new orders from its oem customers 

  consistent with its strategy of developing technologically innovative products the company spent approximately 1610 million 1231 million and 1182 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively on rd activities not included in the reported rd activities were customersponsored rd activities of approximately 333 million 318 million and 223 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

patents and licenses 

  the company has approximately 3500 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others while it considers its patents on the whole to be important the company does not consider any single patent group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the company’s business groups individually the expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operating results the company owns numerous trademarks some of which are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate 

  the company owns the “borgwarner” and “borgwarner automotive” trade names and housemarks and variations thereof which are material to the company’s business 

competition 

  the company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition 

  the company’s major competitors include 

   in addition a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products although these oem customers 

10 have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers the oems could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates 

  for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies 

employees 

  as of december 31 2005 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 17400 salaried and hourly employees as compared with approximately 14500 employees at december 31 2004 of which approximately 7600 were us employees included in these 17400 employees are approximately 2700 beru employees approximately 24 of the company’s us workers are unionized the hourly workers at the company’s nonus operations are typically unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory 

raw materials 

  continuing a trend which began in 2004 several raw materials used in the company’s products hit record pricing levels including steel copper resins and certain alloying elements this was due to a host of market factors not the least of which included global growth demands and the effects of devastating hurricanes in north america 

  despite these challenges the company used a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of inflationary prices and supply shortages the company formed a global procurement organization to accelerate cost reductions purchases from lower cost regions risk mitigation efforts and collaborative buying activities in addition the company used longterm contracts cost sharing arrangements design changes customer buy programs and hedging instruments to help control costs the company intends to use similar measures in 2006 and beyond 

  for 2006 each of the company’s operating segments believes that its supplies of raw materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity 

environmental regulation and proceedings 

  the company’s operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing among other things emissions to air discharge to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the company believes that it has operated its business and facilities in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas even for a company complying with all laws and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs or liabilities in addition through various acquisitions over the years the company has acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities which predate the company’s ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

  the company believes that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material effect on its financial position or future operating results although no assurance can be given in this regard capital expenditures and expenses in 2005 attributable to compliance with such legislation were not material 

11   the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 38 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

  based on the information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives estimated legal fees and other factors the company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2005 of approximately 383 million included in the total accrued liability is the 161 million anticipated remaining costs to settle all outstanding claims related to the crystal springs mississippi plant described separately below which was included in the amount recorded in the second quarter of 2005 for the other 37 sites we have accrued amounts that do not exceed 30 million related to any individual site and management does not believe that the costs related to any of these other individual sites will have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cashflow or financial condition the company expects to expend substantially all of this 383 million environmental accrued liability over the next three to five years 

  in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities relating to the past operations of kuhlman electric the liabilities at issue result from operations of kuhlman electric that predate the company’s acquisition of kuhlman electric’s parent company kuhlman corporation during 1999 during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage

 item 1a risk factors 

our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns 

  automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse effect on our sales to oems and our financial position and operating results 

we are dependent on sport utility vehicle and light truck market segments 

  some of our products in particular fourwheel drive transfer cases are currently used exclusively in fourwheel drive systems for sport utility vehicles and light trucks for 2005 for example sales of rearwheel drive transfer cases represented approximately 12 of our total consolidated revenue any significant reduction in production in this market segment or loss of business in this market segment would have a material adverse effect on our sales to oems and our financial position and operating results 

we face strong competition 

  we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers we are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional us oem customers faced with intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components as a result we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export or raw materials subsidies increased competition could adversely affect our businesses 

we are under substantial pressure from oems to reduce the prices of our products 

  there is substantial and continuing pressure on oems to reduce costs including costs of products we supply although oems have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers a number of our major oem customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products these oems could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply we believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive however we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain our gross margins on product sales to oems or that the trend by oems toward increased outsourcing will continue 

  annual price reductions to oem customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment in 2005 and 2004 the combination of price reductions to customers and cost increases for material labor and overhead totaled approximately 1396 million and 1278 million respectively to maintain our profit margins we seek price reductions from our suppliers improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which support stable or increased prices our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our oem customers is limited with cost recovery less than 100 and often on a delayed basis we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs 

we rely on sales to several major customers 

  our worldwide sales in 2005 to ford volkswagen daimlerchrysler and general motors constituted approximately 16 13 12 and 9 respectively of our 2005 consolidated sales these four 

15 customers constituted approximately 50 of our 2005 sales credit rating agencies rate two of these customers below investment grade the corresponding percentages for 2004 were 21 10 14 and 10 no other single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated sales in 2005 or 2004 

  although we have had longstanding relationships with each of ford volkswagen daimlerchrysler and general motors and have sold a wide variety of products to various divisions of each company globally the loss of any significant portion of our sales to any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

we are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations 

  all three of our primary north american customers ford daimlerchrysler and general motors have major union contracts with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america because of domestic oems’ dependence on a single union we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at oems’ facilities similarly a majority of our global customers’ operations outside of north america are also represented by various unions any extended work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

part of our labor force is unionized 

  as of december 31 2005 approximately 24 of our us hourly employees were unionized our two most significant domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our muncie indiana plant and our ithaca new york plants the muncie agreement expires in may 2009 and the ithaca agreement expires in october 2008 the hourly workers at our european and certain asian facilities are also unionized while we believe that our relations with our employees are good a prolonged dispute with our employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 

  our operations are subject to laws governing among other things emissions to air discharges to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials we believe that our business operations and activities have been and are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result furthermore through various acquisitions over the years we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and we cannot assure you that we will not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future 

  we believe that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or operating results but we cannot assure you that this will be the case capital expenditures and expenses in 2005 attributable to compliance with environmental laws were not material 

we may incur material costs related to product warranties environmental and regulatory matters litigation and other claims 

  we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws as a result as of december 31 2005 we may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 38 of these sites 

16   based on information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance of approximately 383 million at december 31 2005 we currently expect this amount to be expended over the next three to five years 

  we believe that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or operating results either because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared with other potentially responsible parties however we cannot assure you of the ultimate outcome 

  we provide warranties to our customers for some of our products under these warranties we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products we cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our financial statement 

  based upon information available to us we have established an accrual in our financial statements for product warranties with a balance of approximately 440 million at december 31 2005 

  we are also party to or have an obligation to defend a party to various legal proceedings including those described in note 14 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements although we believe that none of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future operating results there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter or proceeding 

our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful 

  we have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating revenues at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions we may not meet our goal because of any of the following a a significant decrease in the production of sport utility vehicles and light trucks high content vehicles for us b the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers c technology changes rendering our products obsolete d a reversal of the trend of supplying systems which allows us to increase content per vehicle instead of components and e the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

  we have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions and countries including north america europe china india south korea japan and brazil and sell our products worldwide for 2005 approximately 55 percent of our sales were outside north america consequently our results could be affected by changes in trade monetary and fiscal policies trade restrictions or prohibitions import or other charges or taxes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates changing economic conditions and political instability and disputes 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

  we base our growth projections in part on commitments made by our customers these commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle if actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and financial performance

  the company has received no written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the staff of the securities and exchange commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2005 fiscal year and that remain unresolved

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule 13a15e management conducted an assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework based on the assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2005 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report below 

  the company’s management including its chief executive officer and the chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

21   changes in internal control 

  the company purchased a 694 stake in beru in january 2005 the company considers the acquisition of beru to be material to the results of its operations financial position and cash flows from the date of acquisition through december 31 2005 and believes that the internal controls and procedures of beru have a material effect on internal control over financial reporting throughout 2005 the company went through a process to coordinate the internal control processes at beru and has extended its sarbanesoxley act section 404 compliance program to include beru at december 31 2005 

  in connection with the coordination of the internal controls and processes of beru beru made improvements to its internal controls and the company improved its monitoring of the preparation of financial information at beru and other reporting units the company and beru made the following improvements to internal control over financial reporting to remediate a control deficiency at beru which resulted in the correction discussed in note 18 to the financial statements 

   there have been no other changes in internal controls over the financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

22 report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and stockholders of borgwarner inc 

  we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that borgwarner inc and consolidated subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

research and development   each of the company’s operating segments has its own research and development “rd” organization the company has 639 employees including engineers mechanics and technicians engaged in rd activities at facilities worldwide the company also operates testing facilities such as prototype measurement and calibration life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories   by working closely with the oems and anticipating their future product needs the company’s rd personnel conceive design develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems rd personnel also work to improve current products and production processes the company believes its commitment to rd will allow it to obtain new orders from its oem customers   consistent with its strategy of developing technologically innovative products the company spent approximately 1231 million 1182 million and 1091 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively on rd activities not included in the reported rd activities were customersponsored rd activities of approximately 318 million 223 million and 142 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively patents and licenses   the company has approximately 3200 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others while it considers its patents on the whole to be important the company does not consider any single patent group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the company’s business groups individually the expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operating results the company owns numerous trademarks some of which are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate   the company owns the “borgwarner” and “borgwarner automotive” trade names and housemarks and variations thereof which are material to the company’s business competition   the company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition many of these companies are larger and have greater resources than the company   the company’s major competitors include    in addition a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products although these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers the oems could elect to 8 manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates 

  for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies employees   as of december 31 2004 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 14500 salaried and hourly employees as compared with approximately 14300 employees at december 31 2003 of which approximately 7900 were us employees approximately 26 of the company’s domestic workers are unionized the hourly workers at the company’s nonus operations are typically unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory raw materials   in 2004 several raw materials used in the company’s products hit record pricing levels including steel copper aluminum and resins this was due to a host of factors not the least of which included unprecedented growth in china despite these difficulties the company used a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of rising prices and supply shortages of certain raw materials the company formed a global purchasing organization to drive cost reductions and create collaboration across business operations in addition the company used longterm contracts cost sharing arrangements design changes resourcing customer buy programs and hedging instruments to help control costs the company intends to use similar tactics in 2005 and beyond   for 2005 each of the company’s operating segments believes that its supplies of raw materials for manufacturing requirements are adequate and are available from multiple sources it is common however for customers to require their prior approval before certain raw materials or components can be used thereby reducing sources of supply that would otherwise be available manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity environmental regulation and proceedings   the company’s operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing among other things emissions to air discharge to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the company believes that it has operated its business and facilities in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas even for a company complying with all laws and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs or liabilities in addition through various acquisitions over the years the company has acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities which predate the company’s ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future   the company believes that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material effect on its financial position or future operating results although no assurance can be given in this regard capital expenditures and expenses in 2004 attributable to compliance with such legislation were not material 9   the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 39 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula   based on the information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the cost apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs remediation alternatives estimated legal fees and other factors the company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at december 31 2004 of approximately 257 million the company expects this amount to be expended over the next three to five years   the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or future operating results generally either because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter   in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation “kuhlman electric” the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities relating to the past operations of kuhlman electric the liabilities at issue relate from operations of kuhlman electric that predate the company’s acquisition of kuhlman corporation during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant   the company has been working with the mississippi department of environmental quality the epa and kuhlman electric to investigate the extent of and remediate the contamination the investigation revealed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls “pcbs” in portions of the soil at the plant and neighboring areas cleanup began in 2000 and is continuing kuhlman electric and others including the company have been sued in numerous related lawsuits in which multiple claimants allege personal injury and property damage the first trial in these lawsuits is currently scheduled to begin in march 2005   the company believes that the accrual for environmental liabilities and any insurance recoveries are adequate to cover any potential liability associated with environmental matters however due to the nature of environmental remediation and litigation there can be no assurance that the actual amount of environmental liabilities will not exceed the accrual amount available information   through its website wwwborgwarnercom the company makes available free of charge the annual report on form 10k quarterly reports

   see note fifteen of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 52 through 54 of the company’s annual report for geographic information customers   approximately 77 of the company’s total sales in 2003 were to automotive oems with the remaining 23 of the company’s sales to a diversified group of industrial construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers auto part manufacturers and to distributors of automotive aftermarket and replacement parts   the company’s worldwide sales in 2003 to ford daimlerchrysler and general motors constituted approximately 23 17 and 12 respectively of its 2003 consolidated sales approximately 37 of consolidated sales for 2003 were outside the united states including exports however a substantial portion of such sales was to foreign oems of vehicles that are in turn exported to the united states see note fifteen of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 52 through 54 of the company’s annual report   the company’s automotive products are generally sold directly to oems substantially pursuant to either negotiated longterm supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the oems the company ships its products directly from its plants to the oems 6 sales and marketing   each of the company’s business units within its two operating segments has its own sales function headed by a vice president of sales account executives for each business unit are assigned to serve specific oem customers for one or more of a business unit’s products such account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with oem purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of their close relationship with the oems account executives are able to identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of the company’s products and design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account executives participate in product launch team activities as a key interface to the customers   in addition within the engine segment and the drivetrain segment sales and marketing employees work together to explore crossmarketing opportunities for the business units the development of dualtronic™ the company’s wetclutch and controlsystem technology for a newconcept automated transmission is a successful example of this collaboration research and development   each of the company’s operating segments has its own research and development “rd” organization the company has 626 employees including engineers mechanics and technicians engaged in rd activities at facilities worldwide the company also operates testing facilities such as prototype measurement and calibration life testing and dynamometer laboratories   by working closely with the oems and anticipating their future product needs the company’s rd personnel conceive design develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems rd personnel also work to improve current products and production processes the company believes its commitment to rd will allow it to obtain new orders from its oem customers   consistent with its strategy of developing technologically innovative products the company spent approximately 1182 million 1091 million and 1045 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively on rd activities not included in the reported rd activities were customersponsored rd activities that were approximately 223 million 142 million and 200 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively patents and licenses   the company has approximately 3000 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others while it considers its patents on the whole to be important the company does not consider any single patent group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the company’s business groups individually the expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operating results the company owns numerous trademarks some of which are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate   the company owns the “borgwarner” and “borgwarner automotive” trade names and housemarks and variations thereof which are material to the company’s business competition   the company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition competitors include vertically integrated units of the company’s major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers some of which were formerly part of the company’s oem customers many of these companies are larger and have greater resources than the company 7   a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products although these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers the oems could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates   for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies employees   as of december 31 2003 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 14300 salaried and hourly employees as compared with approximately 14000 employees at december 31 2002 of which approximately 8100 were us employees approximately 28 of the company’s domestic hourly workers are unionized the hourly workers at the company’s european facilities are also unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory raw materials   each of the company’s operating segments believes that its supplies of raw materials for manufacturing requirements in 2004 are adequate and are available from multiple sources it is common however for customers to require their prior approval before certain raw materials or components can be used thereby reducing sources of supply that would otherwise be available manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity environmental regulation and proceedings   the company’s operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing among other things emissions to air discharge to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the company believes that it has operated its business and facilities in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas even for a company complying with all laws and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs or liabilities in addition through various acquisitions over the years the company has acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities which predate the company’s ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future   the company believes that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material effect on its financial position or future operating results although no assurance can be given in this regard capital expenditures and expenses in 2003 attributable to compliance with such legislation were not material   the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 43 such sites responsibility 8 for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 

  based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the costs apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation costs remediation alternatives estimated legal fees and other factors the company has established a reserve for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately 196 million at december 31 2003 the company expects this amount to be expended over the next three to five years   the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or future operating results generally either because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter   in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation “kuhlman electric” the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities relating to the past operations of kuhlman electric during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant   the company has been working with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate the extent of and to remediate the contamination the investigation revealed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls “pcbs” in portions of the soil at the plant and neighboring areas cleanup began in 2000 and is continuing kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in several related lawsuits which claim personal and property damage the company has moved to be dismissed from some of these lawsuits   the company believes that the reserve for environmental liabilities is sufficient to cover any liability associated with this matter however due to the nature of environmental liability matters there can be no assurance that the actual amount of environmental liabilities will not exceed the amount reserved available information   through its website wwwbwautocom the company makes available free of charge the annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k all amendments to those reports and other filings with the securities and exchange commission as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed the company also makes the

laboratories   by working closely with the oems and anticipating their future product needs the company’s rd personnel conceive design develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems rd personnel also work to improve current products and production processes the company believes its commitment to rd will allow it to obtain new orders from its oem customers   consistent with its strategy of developing technologically innovative products the company spent approximately 1091 million 1045 million and 1120 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively on rd activities not included in the reported rd activities were customersponsored rd activities that were approximately 142 million 200 million and 125 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively patents and licenses   the company has approximately 3300 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others while it considers its patents on the whole to be important the company does not consider any single patent group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the company’s business groups individually the expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operating results the company owns numerous trademarks some of which are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate   the company owns the “borgwarner” and “borgwarner automotive” trade names and housemarks and variations thereof which are material to the company’s business competition   each of the company’s operating segments competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of competition competitors include vertically integrated units of the company’s major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers some of which were formerly part of the company’s oem customers many of these companies are larger and have greater resources than the company   a number of the company’s major oem customers manufacture for their own use and for others products which compete with the company’s products although these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers the oems could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates   for many of its products the company’s competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw materials subsidies 7 employees   as of december 31 2002 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 14000 salaried and hourly employees as compared with approximately 13000 employees at december 31 2001 of which approximately 8600 were us employees approximately 28 of the company’s domestic hourly workers are unionized the hourly workers at the company’s european facilities are also unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory raw materials   each of the company’s operating segments believes that its supplies of raw materials for manufacturing requirements in 2003 are adequate and are available from multiple sources it is common however for customers to require their prior approval before certain raw materials or components can be used thereby reducing sources of supply that would otherwise be available manufacturing operations for each of the company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural gas fuel oil and electricity environmental regulation and proceedings   the company’s operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing among other things emissions to air discharge to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste and other materials the company believes that it has operated its business and facilities in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas even for a company complying with all laws and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs or liabilities in addition through various acquisitions over the years the company has acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities which predate the company’s ownership in addition potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future   the company believes that the overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material effect on its financial position or future operating results although no assurance can be given in this regard capital expenditures and expenses in 2002 attributable to compliance with such legislation were not material   the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties “prps” at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “superfund” and equivalent state laws and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 44 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula   based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully pay the costs apportioned to them currently available information from prps andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation costs remediation alternatives estimated legal fees and other factors the company has established a reserve for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately 203 million at december 31 2002 the company expects this amount to be expended over the next three to five years 8   the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or future operating results generally either because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter   in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities relating to the past operations of kuhlman electric during 2000 kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant   the company has been working with the mississippi department of environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate the extent of the contamination the investigation has revealed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls “pcbs” in portions of the soil at the plant and neighboring areas kuhlman electric and others including the company were sued in several related lawsuits which claim personal and property damage the company has moved to be dismissed from some of these lawsuits   the company’s lawsuit against kuhlman electric seeking declaration of the scope of the company’s contractual indemnity has been amicably resolved and dismissed the company believes that the reserve for environmental liabilities is sufficient to cover any liability associated with this matter however due to the nature of environmental liability matters there can be no assurance that the actual amount of environmental liabilities will not exceed the amount reserved available information   through its website

and conditions as may be modified by the parties deliveries are subject to
periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the oems the
company ships its products directly from its plants to the oems

sales and marketing

     each of the companys operating segments has its own sales function headed
by a vice president of sales account executives for each group are assigned to
serve specific oem customers for one or more of a business groups products
such account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with
oem purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing
existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business because of
their close relationship with the oems account executives are able to identify
and meet customers needs based upon their knowledge of the companys products
and design and manufacturing capabilities upon securing a new order account
executives participate in product launch team activities as a key interface to
the customers

research and development

     each of the companys operating segments has its own research and
development rd organization  four hundred and eightyseven employees
including engineers mechanics and technicians are engaged in rd activities at
company facilities worldwide the company also operates testing facilities such
as prototype measurement and calibration life testing and dynamometer
laboratories

     by working closely with the oems and anticipating their future product

916 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively on rd activities not
included in the reported rd activities were customersponsored rd activities
that were approximately 200 million 125 million and 94 million in 2001
2000 and 1999 respectively

patents and licenses

     the company has approximately 2800 active domestic and foreign patents and
patent applications pending or under preparation and receives royalties from
licensing patent rights to others while it considers its patents on the whole
to be important the company does not consider any single patent group of
related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the
aggregate or to the operations of any of the companys business groups
individually the expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is
not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial position or
future operating results the company owns numerous trademarks some of which
are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate

     the company owns the borgwarner and borgwarner automotive trade names
and housemarks and variations thereof which are material to the companys
business

competition

     each of the companys operating segments competes worldwide with a number
of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products
price quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of
competition competitors include vertically integrated units of the companys
major oem customers as well as a large number of independent domestic and
international suppliers some of which were formerly part of our oem customers
many of these companies are larger and have greater resources than the company

     a number of the companys major oem customers manufacture for their own
use and for others products which compete with the companys products although
these oem customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside
suppliers the oems could elect to manufacture products to meet their own
requirements or to compete with the company there can be no assurance that the
companys business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in
the markets in which it operates

     the competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few
years as the companys traditional united states oem customers faced with
intense international competition have expanded their worldwide sourcing of
components as a result the company has experienced competition from suppliers
in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor
costs lower health care costs and in some cases export subsidies andor raw
materials subsidies

employees

     as of december 31 2001 the company and its consolidated subsidiaries had
approximately 13000 salaried and hourly employees as compared with
approximately 14000 employees at december 31 2000 of which approximately
8100 were us employees approximately 40 of the companys domestic hourly
workers are unionized the hourly workers at the companys european facilities
are also unionized the company believes its present relations with employees to
be satisfactory

raw materials

     each of the companys operating segments believes that its supplies of raw
materials for manufacturing requirements in 2002 are adequate and are available
from multiple sources it is common however for customers to require their
prior approval before certain raw materials or components can be used thereby
reducing sources of supply that would otherwise be available manufacturing
operations for each of the companys operating segments are dependent upon
natural gas fuel oil propane and electricity

environmental regulation and proceedings

     the companys operations are subject to federal state local and foreign
laws and regulations governing among other things emissions to air discharge
to waters and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and
disposal of waste and other materials the company believes that it has operated
its business and facilities in compliance in all material respects with
applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations many of
which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations
however the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in
these areas even for a company complying with all laws and there can be no
assurance that the company will not incur material costs or liabilities in
addition through various acquisitions over the years the company has acquired
a number of manufacturing facilities and there can be no assurance that the
company will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities
which predate the companys ownership in addition potentially significant
expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental
and health and safety laws regulations or requirements that may be adopted or
imposed in the future

     the company believes that the overall impact of compliance with regulations
and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material effect on
its financial position or future operating results although no assurance can be
given in this regard capital expenditures and expenses in 2001 attributable to
compliance with such legislation were not material

     the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect
corporate predecessors subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the
united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental
agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at
various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental
response compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws
and as such may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial
activities at 43 such sites responsibility for cleanup and other remedial
activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an
allocation formula

     based on information available to the company which in most cases
includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps the probability
that other prps many of whom are large solvent public companies will fully
pay the costs apportioned to them currently available information from prps
andor federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
contamination and estimated remediation costs remediation alternatives
estimated legal fees and other factors the company has established a reserve
for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately
255 million at december 31 2001 the company expects this amount to be
expended over the next three to five years

     the company believes that none of these matters individually or in the
aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or
future operating results generally either because estimates of the maximum
potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared
with other prps although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate
outcome of any such matter

     in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation the company
agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental
liabilities relating to the past operations of kuhlman electric during 2000
kuhlman electric notified the company that it discovered potential environmental
contamination at its crystal springs mississippi plant while undertaking an
expansion of the plant

     the company has been working with the mississippi department of
environmental quality and kuhlman electric to investigate the extent of the
contamination the investigation has revealed the presence of pcbs in portions
of the soil at the plant and neighboring areas   in mid 2001 kuhlman electric
corporation and others including the company were sued by 26 plaintiffs in
several lawsuits which claim personal and property damage  the company has
moved to be dismissed from theses lawsuits

     the company has filed a lawsuit against kuhlman electric seeking a
declaration of the scope of the companys contractual indemnity the company
believes that the reserve for environmental liabilities is sufficient to cover
any liability associated with this matter
