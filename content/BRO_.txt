competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based upon innovation knowledge understanding of terms and conditions of coverage quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals or small enterprises and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet and startup technology companies continue to be a source for direct placement of personal lines or small business insurance we have our own technology capabilities to also serve singleline and small businesses while it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals or small businesses purchasing insurance over the internet we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with singleline coverage or small businesses that do not have a complex insurance program which represent a small portion of our overall retail or national programs segments 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex

 item 1a ri sk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to and could be materially adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results we present these risk factors grouped by category and the risks factors contained in each respective category are presented in order of their relative priority to us 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and the resulting governmental and societal responses the severity and duration of covid19 including through any new variant strains of the underlying virus the effectiveness and accessibility to vaccines the pace and rate at which vaccines are administered actions taken by governmental authorities in response to covid19 and the direct and indirect impact of covid19 on the us economy and the global economy may materially and adversely affect the company’s business liquidity customers insurance carriers and third parties 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 surfaced since then covid19 has spread across the world and has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the global outbreak of covid19 continues to rapidly evolve the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption which could further adversely affect our business and may materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the extent to which covid19 impacts our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the ultimate geographic spread and severity of covid19 the duration of the pandemic the effectiveness and rollout of vaccinations against covid19 societys willingness to receive the vaccinations business closures travel restrictions social distancing and other actions taken to contain and treat covid19 the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the virus the impact of the pandemic on economic activity the timing and effectiveness of government stimulus programs the extent and duration of the effect on customer demand and buying patterns and any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions in addition if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets or impacts our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

as the covid19 pandemic and any associated protective or preventative measures continue to spread in the united states and around the world we may experience disruptions to our business including 

  

• our customers choosing to limit purchases of insurance and services due to declining business conditions our customers ceasing their business operations on a temporary or permanent basis and a reduction in our customers’ insurable exposure units all of which would impact our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue 

• a delay in cash payments to us from customers or carrier partners due to covid19 which could negatively impact our financial condition 

• travel restrictions and quarantines leading to a lack of inperson meetings which would hinder our ability to establish relationships or originate new business 

• alternative working arrangements including employees working remotely which could negatively impact our business should such arrangements remain for an extended period of time and 

• failure of third parties upon which we rely to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to meet those obligations in a timely manner which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties 

  

we cannot predict the impact that covid19 will have on our customers insurance carriers suppliers and other thirdparty contractors and each of their financial conditions however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’ global economic impact further covid19 may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks to our operations 

  

additionally should any key employees become ill from the coronavirus and unable to work the attention of the management team could be diverted 

these and other disruptions related to covid19 could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows further the potential effects of covid19 also could impact and in some cases magnify many of our risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k however as the covid19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving the potential impacts to our risk factors remain uncertain additionally any potential effects of covid19 may lag behind the developments related to the covid19 pandemic 

risks related to our business 

significant inflation could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing our costs including salary costs significant inflation is often accompanied by higher 

interest rates any significant increases in inflation and interest rates could have material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key employees were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key employees are generally prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a twoyear period following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives the succession plans and employment arrangements we have in place with certain key executives do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us the loss of our senior leaders or other key employees or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future or which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and continuously improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that may have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of employees increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of operating performance could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

  

a cybersecurity attack or any other interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation 

we rely on information technology and thirdparty vendors to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report information to carriers and which often involves secure processing of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions any of which could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents such as malware infections phishing campaigns and vulnerability exploit attempts which to date have not had a material impact on our business 

additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack in the future any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard customers’ information or financial losses such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain 

we cannot entirely eliminate all risk of improper access to private information and the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase as these threats evolve cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation 

rapid technological change may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions 

we are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities including how we electronically interact with our customers and insurance carriers maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio regularly or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share or a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions guaranteed supplemental commissions or incentive commissions 

for the year ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 no more than 50 of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should this insurance company seek to terminate its arrangements with us or to otherwise decrease the number of insurance policies underwritten for us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could result 

  

because a significant portion of our businesses are concentrated in florida california massachusetts georgia new york and michigan adverse economic conditions natural disasters or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our businesses are concentrated in florida california massachusetts georgia new york and michigan where for the year ended december 31 2021 we derived approximately 18 11 8 7 7 and 6 of our annual revenue respectively we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business in the us is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes particularly in florida where we have 52 offices and our headquarters as well as in texas where we have 25 offices earthquakes including in california where we have 31 offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or humanmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

our corporate culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy our business may be harmed 

we believe that a significant contributor to our success has been our corporate culture as a lean highly competitive decentralized growth and profitoriented sales and service organization as we grow including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our profitability andor our ability to retain and recruit people of the highest integrity and quality who are essential to our future success we may face pressure to change our culture as we grow particularly if we experience difficulties in attracting competent employees who are willing to embrace our culture in addition as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture such as our decentralized sales and service operating model which could negatively impact our future success 

we face a variety of risks in our services segment including our thirdparty claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance intermediary operations 

our services segment including our thirdparty claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our insurance intermediary operations including the risks that 

• the favorable trend among both insurance companies and selfinsured entities toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services may reverse or slow causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline 

• concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain customers may result in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due to changes in management of such customers or for other reasons 

• contracting terms will become less favorable or the margins on our services may decrease due to increased competition regulatory constraints or other developments 

• our revenue is impacted by claims volumes which are dependent upon a number of factors and difficult to forecast accurately 

• economic weakness or a slowdown in economic activity could lead to a reduction in the number of claims we process 

• the us federal government modifies discontinues or otherwise limits our ability to derive revenues from the social security disability benefits program medicare or any other program or type of coverage from which our business derives revenue 

• we may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claimshandling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain customers if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations and 

• insurance companies or certain large selfinsured entities may create inhouse servicing capabilities that compete with our services 

if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

due to inherent limitations our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and fraud because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

there can be no assurance that the design of any of our systems of controls will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

certain of our existing shareholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2021 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 166 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman of the board and his sons j powell brown our president and chief executive officer and p barrett brown our executive vice president and the president of our retail segment beneficially owned approximately 158 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over i the election of our board of directors ii the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval and iii our affairs and policies 

we have operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

we have operations in bermuda canada cayman islands ireland and the united kingdom in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 

• less flexible employee relationships which may make it difficult and expensive to terminate employees and which limits our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment ceases 

• political and economic instability including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war 

• coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws 

• adverse trade policies and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the us or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 

• adverse changes in tax rates 

• variations in foreign currency exchange rates 

• legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices 

• governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from us including to or from our operations outside the united states 

• burdens of complying with and the risk of employees or third parties acting on our behalf violating anticorruption laws in foreign countries and 

• burdens of complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws including those relating to export and import duties environmental policies and privacy issues 

risks related to legal compliance and regulatory matters 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage retention handling use processing disclosure transfer and security of personal data significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with thirdparty vendors for example the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation “gdpr” in may 2016 which replaced the former eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr became 

  

fully effective in may 2018 and requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including its processing protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices additionally a judgement by the court of justice of the european union on schrems ii has made cross border data transfers to organizations outside of the european economic area more onerous and uncertain in addition legislators and regulators in the us have enacted and are proposing new and more robust privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations in light of the recent broadbased cyberattacks at a number of companies including but not limited to the new york state department of financial services cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 some states provide right of action for data breaches or for collection of certain categories of personal information without consent which may result in increased litigation 

these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place administrative physical procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by certain actual and potential claims regulatory actions and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims regulatory actions and other proceedings including those relating to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business of which we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome with certainty because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based upon allegations that our employees or subagents failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years 

our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert employees and management resources 

  

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in regulations 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally some of our offices are parties to supplemental commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies various state legislatures may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete in a highly regulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in each of the 50 states of the united states of america and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of those states the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders and it is difficult to anticipate how changes in such regulation would be implemented and enforced as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs technology compliance restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices determining technology and data protection requirements establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and new york as well as certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business certain federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the affordable care act and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

  

risks related to our indebtedness and financing 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

at december 31 2021 we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of the credit agreements that govern out debt however failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition in the event of certain defaults the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable if the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities in particular among other covenants our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain transactionrelated items “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by further changes in the us credit markets 

the failure of any lender under our revolving credit facility which matures in 2026 could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment and to the extent we use debt to finance our investments changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income 

as of july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority “fca” has urged banks and institutions to discontinue their use of the london interbank offered rate “libor” benchmark rate for floating rate debt and other financial instruments tied to the rate after 2021 to help with the transition the federal reserve board and new york fed have commissioned the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” composed of a diverse set of privatesector entities that have an important presence in markets affected by usd libor and a wide array of officialsector entities including banking and financial sector regulators as exofficio members the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the best alternative rate to libor post discontinuance and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of sofr from libor on march 5 2021 the ice benchmark administration which administers libor and the fca announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december 31 2021 for all nonus dollar libor settings and oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings and immediately after june 30 2023 for the remaining us dollar libor settings 

as of december 31 2021 the company’s primary exposures are debt instruments referencing liborbased rates which include the second amended and restated credit agreement the “second amended and restated credit agreement” term loan balance of 2469 million outstanding and matures in october 2026 as well as the term loan credit agreement the “term loan credit agreement” which had an outstanding balance of 2400 million and matures in december 2023 as such any potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital interest rate exposure and net investment income cannot yet be determined in addition any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of any liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the company is currently evaluating the transition from libor as an interest rate benchmark to other potential alternative reference rates including but not limited to sofr currently it is anticipated that the new benchmark for our usd borrowings will be sofr the shift to sofr from libor is complex and may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations liquidity and cash flows 

  

risks related to our industry 

our current market share may decrease as a result of disintermediation within the insurance industry including increased competition from insurance companies technology companies and the financial services industry as well as the shift away from traditional insurance markets 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition and to the extent that banks securities firms private equity funds and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediary services 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets and we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets 

changes in current us or global economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

if economic conditions were to worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates the financial insolvency of insurance companies or the reduced ability of customers to pay also if general economic conditions are poor some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these customers are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties that could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer to our customers we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our customers may be more expensive or limited 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and supplemental commissions can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business policy renewals and payments from insurance companies may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based primarily upon the profitability and to a lesser extent may have provisions for volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies generally during the prior year over the last three years these commissions generally have been in the range of 30 to 35 of our previous year’s total core commissions and fees due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations supplemental commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect our results of operations profitability and our financial condition 

  

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2021 fiscal year we have 47 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2021 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis before the next annual goodwill impairment test if determined that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary the appropriate adjustment would be recorded which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see note 1“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 4“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising the company is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year we assess the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted 

there have been no impairments recorded to either goodwill or amortizable intangibles for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

company overview 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures” below regarding important information on nongaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales or payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including loss experience risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control we also operate a capitalized captive insurance facility the captive for the purpose of having additional capacity to sell property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties the captive buys reinsurance limiting but not eliminating the companys exposure to underwriting losses and revenues are recognized as net retained earned premiums over the associated policy periods 

we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2021 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues declined 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 31 billion in 2021 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 132 in the same 28year period we increased net income from 81 million to 5871 million in 2021 a compound annual growth rate of 165 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units changes in premium rate levels changes in general economic and competitive conditions a health pandemic and the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically we have grown our revenues as a result of our focus on net new business and acquisitions we foster a strong decentralized sales and service culture which enables responsiveness to changing business conditions and drives accountability for results 

the term “organic revenue” a nongaap measure is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first 12 months by newlyacquired operations ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period and iii the period over period impact of foreign currency translation which is calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same period in the prior year the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered “organic revenue” is reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our customers’ exposure units iii net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners and iv the net change in fees paid to us by our customers organic revenue is reported in “results of operations” and in “results of operations  segment information” of this annual report on form 10k in connection with the captive we will recognize revenue starting in 2022 on a net retained earned premiums basis in a manner consistent with core commissions and fees beginning in 2022 we will no longer exclude guaranteed supplemental commissions from core commissions and fees and therefore they will be a component of organic revenue we anticipate presenting certain prior periods accordingly so that the calculation of organic revenue compares both periods on the same basis guaranteed supplemental commissions are a small and increasingly more stable source of revenue that are highly correlated to core commissions so excluding them provides no meaningful incremental value in evaluating our revenue performance 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions which are included in our commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each subsequent year based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 30 of commissions and fees revenue 

certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” in lieu of profitsharing contingent commissions gscs are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written over the last three years gscs have averaged less than 10 of commissions and fees revenue 

combined our profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 141 million over 2020 this increase was the result of recent acquisitions and qualifying for certain profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2021 that we did not qualify for in the prior year 

fee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers as well as fees negotiated in lieu of commissions and are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied fee revenues are generated by i our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare 

  

benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services ii our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies and iii our retail segment in our largeaccount customer base where we primarily earn fees for securing insurance for our customers and in our automobile dealer services “fi” businesses where we primarily earn fees for assisting our customers with creating and selling warranty and service risk management programs fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 274 in 2021 and 261 in 2020 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 our commissions and fees growth rate was 169 and 93 respectively and our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 104 and 38 respectively 

investment income consists primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous revenues 

income before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 1387 million over 2020 as a result of net new business acquisitions we completed since 2020 and management of our expense base partially offset by an increase in the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

information regarding nongaap measures 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide references to the following nongaap financial measures as defined in regulation g of sec rules organic revenue organic revenue growth ebitdac and ebitdac margin ebitdac is defined as income before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables ebitdac ebitdac margin is defined as ebitdac divided by total revenues we view these nongaap financial measures as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments because they allow us to determine a more comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth and operating performance that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year we believe that organic revenue provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance and view organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our four segments organic revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing organic revenue growth we use organic revenue growth in determining incentive cash compensation and as a performance measure in our equity incentive grants for our executive officers and other key employees we use ebitdac margin for incentive cash compensation determinations for our executive officers we view ebitdac and ebitdac margin as important indicators of operating performance because they allow us to determine more comparable but nongaap measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner by removing the significant noncash items of depreciation amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables as well as interest expense and taxes which are reflective of investment and financing activities not operating performance 

these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this annual report on form 10k we present such nongaap supplemental financial information because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe they provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis we believe these nongaap financial measures improve the comparability of results between periods by eliminating the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments this supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to not in lieu of our consolidated financial statements 

tabular reconciliations of this supplemental nongaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10k under “results of operation  segment information” 

acquisitions 

part of our business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries and service organizations to join our operations from 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2021 we acquired 580 insurance intermediary operations 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based upon a combination of historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the recognition of revenues expenses carrying values of our assets and liabilities of which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition business combinations and purchase price allocations intangible asset impairments noncash stockbased compensation and reserves for litigation in particular the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment to be made by management different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is commissions derived from our performance as agents and brokers acting on behalf of insurance carriers to sell products to customers that are seeking to transfer risk and conversely acting on behalf of those customers in negotiating with insurance carriers seeking to acquire risk in exchange for premiums in the majority of these arrangements our performance obligation is complete upon the effective date of the bound policy as such that is when the associated revenue is recognized in some arrangements where we are compensated through commissions we also perform other services for our customer beyond binding of coverage in those arrangements we apportion the commission between binding of coverage and other services based on their relative fair value and recognize the associated revenue as those performance obligations are satisfied where the company’s performance obligations have been completed but the final amount of compensation is unknown due to variable factors we estimate the amount of such compensation we refine those estimates upon our receipt of additional information or final settlement whichever occurs first 

to a lesser extent the company earns revenues in the form of fees like commissions fees paid to us in lieu of commission are recognized upon the effective date of the bound policy when we are paid a fee for service however the associated revenue is recognized over a period of time that coincides with when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of our work which characterizes most of our claims processing arrangements and various services performed in our property and casualty and employee benefits practices other fees are typically recognized upon the completion of the delivery of the agreedupon services to the customer 

to a much lesser extent the company will earn revenues starting in 2022 in the form of net retained earned premiums in connection with the captive in which the majority of underwriting risk is reinsured and a small portion is retained by the company these premiums are reported net of the ceded premiums for reinsurance and recognized evenly over the associated policy periods 

management determines a policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances 

please see note 2 “revenues” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding the nature and timing of our revenues 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses these assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

in connection with acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the right to represent insureds or claimants supported by the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals of delivery of services their value primarily represents the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future duration of the acquired customer relationships the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which typically range from 3 to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions where an earnout is part of the negotiated transaction subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as a result of updated expectations for the performance of the associated business 

  

the fair value of earnout obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated based on the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecast earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value the company may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if the company does not perform a qualitative assessment or if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the company will calculate the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based upon multiples of ebitdac or on a discounted cash flow basis 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable any of the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii a significant negative industry or economic trend and iii a significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2021 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant nonvested stock awards to our employees with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards during the performance measurement period we review the probable outcome of the performance conditions associated with our performance awards and align the expense accruals with the expected performance outcome 

during the first quarter of 2021 the performance conditions for approximately 12 million shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s 2010 sip and approximately 22000 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2018 and 2020 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2020 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2018 grant date and four years from the 2020 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share 

during the first quarter of 2022 the performance conditions for approximately 13 million shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s 2010 sip and approximately 22000 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2019 and 2021 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2021 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2019 grant date and four years from the 2021 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share 

litigation and claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income 

  

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes for a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 please see part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 23 2021 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows 

  

   

1 “income before income taxes margin” is defined as income before income taxes divided by total revenues 

2 a nongaap financial measure 

nmf  not a meaningful figure 

commissions and fees 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2021 increased 4414 million to 30475 million or 169 over 2020 core commissions and fees in 2021 increased 4273 million composed of i 2613 million of net new and renewal business which reflects an organic revenue growth rate of 104 ii 1701 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2020 iii a positive impact from foreign currency translation of 12 million and iv an offsetting decrease of 53 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding 12 months profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2021 increased by 141 million or 162 compared to the same period in 2020 this increase was the result of recent acquisitions and qualifying for certain profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2021 that we did not qualify for in the prior year 

investment income 

investment income decreased to 11 million in 2021 compared with 28 million in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates as compared to the prior year 

  

other income net 

other income for 2021 was 27 million compared with 45 million in 2020 other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 536 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 550 for the year ended december 31 2020 and increased 140 or 2005 million this increase included 707 million of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2020 therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2021 and 2020 increased by 1298 million or 92 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i an increase in staff salaries attributable to salary inflation ii an increase in accrued performance bonuses and iii an increase in producer compensation associated with revenue growth 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses represented 132 of total revenues for 2021 as compared to 140 for the year ended december 31 2020 other operating expenses for 2021 increased 370 million or 101 from the same period of 2020 growing slower than revenues the net increase included i 402 million of other operating expenses related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2020 ii increased data processing costs as we invest in our business to drive future growth iii slightly higher variable operating expenses including travel and entertainment and meetingrelated expenses partially offset by iv nonrecurring legal costs and the writeoff recorded in 2020 of certain receivables in one of our programs where it was determined the collectability was in doubt and which did not recur in 2021 

gain or loss on disposal 

the company recognized net gains on disposals of 96 million in 2021 and 24 million in 2020 the change in the net gain on disposal was due to activity associated with sales of businesses or portions of businesses although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or because doing so is in the company’s best interest 

amortization 

amortization expense for 2021 increased 111 million to 1196 million or 102 over 2020 this increase reflects the amortization of new intangibles from businesses acquired within the past 12 months partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized 

depreciation 

depreciation expense for 2021 increased 70 million to 333 million or 268 over 2020 changes in depreciation expense reflect the addition of fixed assets resulting from business initiatives net additions of fixed assets resulting from businesses acquired in the past 12 months partially offset by fixed assets which became fully depreciated 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2021 increased 60 million to 650 million or 102 from 2020 the increase is due to higher average debt balances from increased borrowings associated with the issuance of bonds in september 2020 partially offset by the decrease in interest rates associated with our floating rate debt balances 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables

 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk

our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable debt securities nonmarketable debt securities certificates of deposit us treasury securities and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds these investments are subject to interest rate risk the fair values of our invested assets at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date 

as of december 31 2021 we had 4869 million of borrowings outstanding under our various credit agreements all of which bear interest on a floating basis tied to london interbank offered rate “libor” and is therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense the effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as of july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority “fca” has urged banks and institutions to discontinue their use of the libor benchmark rate for floating rate debt and other financial instruments tied to the rate after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” have recommended the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the best alternative rate to libor post discontinuance and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of sofr from libor on march 5 2021 the ice benchmark administration which administrators libor and the fca announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be represented immediately after december 31 2021 for all nonus dollar libor settings and oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings and immediately after june 30 2023 for the remaining us dollar libor settings 

on october 27 2021 the company entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement the second amended and restated credit agreement includes provisions regarding transition from libor to sofr in preparation of the libor cessation management will continue to actively assess the related opportunities and risks associated with the transition as well as monitor related proposals guidance and other alternativerate initiatives with an expectation that the company will be prepared for a termination of libor benchmarks prior to june 30 2023 when typical rate settings will no longer be available 

we are subject to operational exchange rate risk primarily in our ukbased wholesale brokerage business that has a cost base principally denominated in british pounds and a revenue base in several other currencies but principally in us dollars and in our canadian mga business that has substantially all of its revenues and cost base denominated in canadian dollars as of january 14 2021 the company announced the completion of the acquisition of o’leary insurances an ireland based retail brokerage business which has substantially all of its revenue and cost base in euros 

based upon our foreign currency rate exposure as of december 31 2021 an immediate 10 hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

competition

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based upon innovation knowledge understanding of terms and conditions of coverage quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us

 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals or small enterprises  and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the i nternet and startup technology companies continue to be a source for direct placement of personal lines or small business insuranc e  we have our own technology capabilities to also serve singleline and small businesses while it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals or small businesses purchasing insurance over the internet we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with singleline coverage or small businesses that do not have a complex insurance program which represent a small portion of our overall retail or national programs s egment s  

regulation licensing and agency contracts

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states and international jurisdictions are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses we endeavor to monitor the licensing of our employees but the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in a particular jurisdiction in addition to being subjected to fines

 item 1a risk factors

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to and could be materially adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results we present these risk factors grouped by category and the risks factors contained in each respective category are presented in order of their relative priority to us

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and the resulting governmental and societal responses the severity and duration of the pandemic and the resulting impact on the us economy and the global economy may materially and adversely affect the company’s business liquidity customers insurance carriers and third parties

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 surfaced since then covid19 has spread across the world and has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the global outbreak of covid19 continues to rapidly evolve the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption which could further adversely affect our business and may materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the extent to which covid19 impacts our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the ultimate geographic spread and severity of covid19 the duration of the pandemic the effectiveness and rollout of vaccinations against covid19 business closures travel restrictions social distancing and other actions taken to contain and treat covid19 the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the virus the impact of the pandemic on economic activity the timing and effectiveness of government stimulus programs the extent and duration of the effect on customer demand and buying patterns and any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions in addition if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets or impacts our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted

as the covid19 pandemic and any associated protective or preventative measures continue to spread in the united states and around the world we may experience disruptions to our business including

 











 

we cannot predict the impact that covid19 will have on our customers insurance carriers suppliers and other thirdparty contractors and each of their financial conditions however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’ global economic impact further covid19 may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks to our operations 

additionally covid19 could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as a portion of our workforce is required to work from home and therefore new processes procedures and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment further should any key employees become ill from the coronavirus and unable to work the attention of the management team could be diverted our management is focused on mitigating the effects of covid19 which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across our business

 

to mitigate the economic impact caused by covid19 certain governmental entities have declared or proposed a “grace period” on the collection of insurance premiums it is unclear the impact this would have on our commission revenues typically calculated as a percentage of premium it is possible that such grace periods could delay our receipt of revenues as we continue to incur compensation and operating expenses related to serving our clients in addition ce rtain governmental entities have proposed requiring underwriting enterprises to pay business interruption and workers’ compensation claims for covid19 losses despite applicable policy exclusions retroactively expanding business interruption or other coverages could materially negatively affect underwriting enterprises reduce the availability of insurance coverage and negatively affect our ability to generate commission revenues from such policies as well as supplemental and contingent commissions from underwriting enterprises other legislation would require underwriting enterprises to return premiums to clients on certain lines of coverage while it is unclear the impact such legislation would have on us it is possible we could be asked to disgorge commission revenues related to such premiums 

these and other disruptions related to covid19 could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows further the potential effects of covid19 also could impact and in some cases magnify many of our risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k however as the covid19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving the potential impacts to our risk factors remain uncertain additionally any potential effects of covid19 may lag behind the developments related to the covid19 pandemic

risks related to our business 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key personnel were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key personnel are generally prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a twoyear period following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives the succession plans and employment arrangements we have in place with certain key executives do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us the loss of our senior leaders or other key personnel or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future or which if consummated may not be advantageous to us

our growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and continuously improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that may have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of operating performance could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges

 

a cybersecurity attack or any other interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation 

we rely on information technology and thirdparty vendors to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report information to carriers and which often involves secure processing of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions any of which could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents such as malware infections phishing campaigns and vulnerability exploit attempts which to date have not had a material impact on our business

additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack in the future any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard customers’ information or financial losses such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain

we cannot entirely eliminate all risk of improper access to private information and the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase as these threats evolve cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation

rapid technological change may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics which may adversely affect our business and operating results

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions

we are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities including how we electronically interact with our customers and insurance carriers maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio regularly or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share

for the year ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 no more than 50 of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should this insurance company seek to terminate its arrangements with us or to otherwise decrease the number of insurance policies underwritten for us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could result

 

because a significant portion of our business es are concentr ated in florida california massachusetts georgia new york and michigan adverse economic conditions natural disasters or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our businesses are concentrated in florida california massachusetts georgia new york and michigan where for the year ended december 31 2020 we derived approximately 19 11 8 8 7 and 6 of our annual revenue respectively we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes particularly in florida where we have 55 offices and our headquarters as well as in texas where we have 24 offices earthquakes including in california where we have 33 offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms

our corporate culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy our business may be harmed

we believe that a significant contributor to our success has been our corporate culture as a lean decentralized highly competitive profitoriented sales and service organization as we grow including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our profitability andor our ability to retain and recruit people of the highest integrity and quality who are essential to our future success we may face pressure to change our culture as we grow particularly if we experience difficulties in attracting competent personnel who are willing to embrace our culture in addition as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture such as our decentralized sales and service operating model which could negatively impact our future success

we face a variety of risks in our services segment including our thirdparty claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance intermediary operations

our services segment including our thirdparty claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our insurance intermediary operations including the risks that

















if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

 

due to inherent limitations our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and fraud because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control

there can be no assurance that the design of any of our systems of controls will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected

certain of our existing shareholders have significant control of the company

at december 31 2020 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 169 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his son j powell brown our president and chief executive officer and p barrett brown our executive vice president and the president of our retail segment beneficially owned approximately 161 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies

we have operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability

we have operations in bermuda canada cayman islands ireland and the united kingdom in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including



























 

risks related to legal compliance and regulatory matters 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with thirdparty vendors for example the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation “gdpr” in may 2016 which replaced the former eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr became fully effective in may 2018 and requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices in addition legislators and regulators in the us have enacted and are proposing new and more robust privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations in light of the recent broadbased cyberattacks at a number of companies including but not limited to the new york state department of financial services cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies and the california consumer privacy act of 2018

these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues

our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by certain actual and potential claims regulatory actions and proceedings

we are subject to various actual and potential claims regulatory actions and other proceedings including those relating to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business of which we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome with certainty because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based upon allegations that our employees or subagents failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years 

our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources

 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in regulations 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally some of our offices are parties to supplemental commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies various state legislatures may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters which could adversely affect our results of operations

we compete in a highly regulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations

we conduct business in each of the fifty states of the united states of america and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of those states the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders and it is difficult to anticipate how changes in such regulation would be implemented and enforced as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs technology compliance restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices determining technology and data protection requirements establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and new york as well as certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business certain federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the affordable care act and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues

 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected

at december 31 2020 we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of the credit agreements that govern out debt however failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition in the event of certain defaults the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable if the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full

certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities

the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities in particular among other covenants our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain transactionrelated items “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by further changes in the usbased credit markets

the failure of any lender under our revolving credit facility which matures in 2022 could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 

we are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment and to the extent we use debt to finance our investments changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income

as of july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority “fca” has urged banks and institutions to discontinue their use of the london interbank overnight rate “libor” benchmark rate for floating rate debt and other financial instruments tied to the rate after 2021 to help with the transition the federal reserve board and new york fed have commissioned the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” comprised of a diverse set of privatesector entities that have an important presence in markets affected by usd libor and a wide array of officialsector entities including banking and financial sector regulators as exofficio members the arrc have recommended the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the best alternative rate to libor post discontinuance and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of sofr from libor 

as of december 31 2020 the company’s primary exposure are debt instruments referencing liborbased rates which includes the amended and restated credit agreement the “amended and restated credit agreement” term loan balance of 2900 million outstanding and matures in june 2022 as well as the term loan credit agreement the “term loan credit agreement” which had an outstanding balance of 2700 million and matures in december 2023 as such any potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital interest rate exposure and net investment income cannot yet be determined in addition any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of any liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the company is currently evaluating the transition from libor as an interest rate benchmark to other potential alternative reference rates including but not limited to sofr management will continue to actively assess the related opportunities and risks associated with the transition and monitor related proposals and guidance published by arrc and other alternativerate initiatives with an expectation the we will be prepared to for a termination of libor benchmarks after 2021

 

risks related to our industry 

our current market share may decrease as a result of disintermediation within the insurance industry including increased competition from insurance companies technology companies and the financial services industry as well as the shift away from traditional insurance markets

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition and to the extent that banks securities firms private equity funds and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediary services 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets and we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets

current us or global economic conditions may adversely affect our business

if economic conditions were to worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates the financial insolvency of insurance companies or the reduced ability of customers to pay also if general economic conditions are poor some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these customers are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties that could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer to our customers we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our customers may be more expensive or limited

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and supplemental commissions can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business policy renewals and payments from insurance companies may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies generally during the prior year over the last three years these commissions generally have been in the range of 30 to 35 of our previous year’s total core commissions and fees due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations supplemental commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect our results of operations profitability and our financial condition

 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2020 fiscal year we have 44 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2020 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if determined that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary the appropriate charge would be recorded which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see note 1“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 4“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting”

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising the company is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year we assess the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

general

impact of covid19

the coronavirus pandemic “covid19” and the resulting economic disruption are impacting and will likely continue to impact business activity across many industries worldwide

covid19 remains dynamic with uncertainty around its duration and broader impact we are monitoring and assessing the situation and will continue to adapt our business practices over the coming quarters to serve our customers and protect our employees the pandemic has reduced and is expected to continue to negatively impact the volume of business from new customers and insurable exposure units for existing customers

company overview

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures” below regarding important information on nongaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including loss experience risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control

we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2020 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues declined 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 26 billion in 2020 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 130 in the same 27year period we increased net income from 81 million to 4805 million in 2020 a compound annual growth rate of 163

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units changes in premium rate levels changes in general economic and competitive conditions a health pandemic and the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we foster a strong decentralized sales and service culture with the goal of consistent sustained growth over the longterm

the term “organic revenue” a nongaap measure is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first 12 months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered “organic revenue” is reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our customers’ exposure units iii net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners and iv the net change in fees paid to us by our customers organic revenue is reported in “results of operations” and in “results of operations – segment information” of this annual report on form 10k

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions which are included in our commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each subsequent year based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 30 of commissions and fees revenue

certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” in lieu of profitsharing contingent commissions gscs are accrued throughout the year based upon actual premiums written for the year ended december 31 2020 we had earned 162 million of gscs of which 119 million remained accrued at december 31 2020 and most of this will be collected over the first and second quarters of 2021 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we earned 162 million and 231 million respectively from gscs

combined our profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for the year ended december 31 2020 increased by 49 million over 2019 the net increase of 49 million was mainly driven by i cash received for profitsharing contingent commissions in the first and second quarters of 2020 being somewhat higher than the amount accrued as of december 31 2019 for the estimate of contingents earned in 2019 ii growth associated with acquisitions completed over the last twelve months and iii partially offset by a gsc of approximately 9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for the national programs segment that will not recur in the future as the associated multiyear contract has ended

 

fee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers as well as fees negotiated in lieu of commissions and are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by 1 our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies and to a lesser extent 3 our retail segment in our largeaccount customer base  where we primarily earn fees for securing insurance for our customers and in our automobile dealer services “fi” businesses where we primarily earn fees for assisting our customers with creating and selling warranty and service risk management programs  fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 2 6 1  in 20 20 and 271  in 201 9  

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 our commissions and fees growth rate was 93 and 187 respectively and our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 38 and 36 respectively

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous income

income before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2020 increased over 2019 by 982 million primarily as a result of net new business acquisitions we completed since 2019 and management of our expense base

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide references to the following nongaap financial measures as defined in regulation g of sec rules organic revenue organic revenue growth ebitdac and ebitdac margin we view these nongaap financial measures as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments because they allow us to determine a more comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth and operating performance that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year we believe that organic revenue provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance and view organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our four segments organic revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing organic revenue growth we also use organic revenue growth and ebitdac margin for incentive compensation determinations for executive officers and other key employees we view ebitdac and ebitdac margin as important indicators of operating performance because they allow us to determine more comparable but nongaap measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner by removing the significant noncash items of depreciation amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and also interest expense and taxes which are reflective of investment and financing activities not operating performance

these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this annual report on form 10k we present such nongaap supplemental financial information because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe they provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis we believe these nongaap financial measures improve the comparability of results between periods by eliminating the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments this supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to not in lieu of our consolidated financial statements

tabular reconciliations of this supplemental nongaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10k under “results of operation  segment information”

acquisitions

part of our business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries and service organizations to join our operations from 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2020 we acquired 561 insurance intermediary operations

critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based upon historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the recognition of revenues expenses carrying values of our assets and liabilities of which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates

 

we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition business combinations and purchase price allocations intangible asset impairments noncash stockbased compensation and reserves for litigation in particular the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment to be made by management different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 

revenue recognition

the majority of our revenue is commissions derived from our performance as agents and brokers acting on behalf of insurance carriers to sell products to customers that are seeking to transfer risk and conversely acting on behalf of those customers in negotiating with insurance carriers seeking to acquire risk in exchange for premiums in the majority of these arrangements our performance obligation is complete upon the effective date of the bound policy as such that is when the associated revenue is recognized in some arrangements where we are compensated through commissions we also perform other services for our customer beyond the binding of coverage in those arrangements we apportion the commission between the binding of coverage and other services based on their relative fair value and recognize the associated revenue as those performance obligations are satisfied where the company’s performance obligations have been completed but the final amount of compensation is unknown due to variable factors we estimate the amount of such compensation we refine those estimates upon our receipt of additional information or final settlement whichever occurs first

to a lesser extent the company earns revenues in the form of fees like commissions fees paid to us in lieu of commission are recognized upon the effective date of the bound policy when we are paid a fee for service however the associated revenue is recognized over a period of time that coincides with when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of our work which characterizes most of our claims processing arrangements and various services performed in our property and casualty and employee benefits practices other fees are typically recognized upon the completion of the delivery of the agreedupon services to the customer

management determines a policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances

please see note 2 “revenues” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding the nature and timing of our revenues

business combinations and purchase price allocations

we have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses these assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges

our business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals of delivery of services however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from 3 to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized

acquisition purchase prices are typically based upon a multiple of average ebitda annual operating profit andor core revenue earned over a one to threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions where an earnout is part of the negotiated transaction subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when changes to the expected performance of the associated business are realized

 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated based on the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” or on a discounted cash flow basis

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable any of the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii a significant negative industry or economic trend and iii a significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2020 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

noncash stockbased compensation

we grant nonvested stock awards to our employees with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards during the performance measurement period we review the probable outcome of the performance conditions associated with our performance awards and align the expense accruals with the expected performance outcome

during the first quarter of 2020 the performance conditions for 1880512 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s 2010 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2015 and 2017 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2019 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to seven years from the 2015 grant date and five years from the 2017 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share

during the first quarter of 2021 the performance conditions for approximately 12 million shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s 2010 sip and approximately 22000 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s 2019 sip were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2018 and 2020 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2020 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2018 grant date and four years from the 2020 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share

litigation and claims

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income

commissions and fees

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2020 increased 2214 million to 26061 million or 93 over 2019 core commissions and fees in 2020 increased 2165 million composed of i 1411 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2019 ii an offsetting decrease of 121 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding twelve months and iii approximately 875 million of net new and renewal business which reflects an organic revenue growth rate of 38 profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2020 increased by 49 million or 60 compared to the same period in 2019 the net increase of 49 million was mainly driven by i cash received for profitsharing contingent commissions in the first and second quarters of 2020 being somewhat higher than the amount accrued as of december 31 2019 for the estimate of contingents earned in 2019 ii growth associated with acquisitions completed over the last twelve months and iii partially offset by a gsc of approximately 9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for the national programs segment that will not recur in the future as the associated multiyear contract ended in 2019

 

investment income 

investment income decreased to 28 million in 2020 compared with 58 million in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates as compared to the prior year

other income net

other income for 2020 was 45 million compared with 17 million in 2019 other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income

employee compensation and benefits

employee compensation and benefits expense increased 98 or 1282 million in 2020 compared to 2019 this increase included 480 million of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2019 therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2020 and 2019 increased by 802 million or 62 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i an increase in staff salaries attributable to salary inflation ii an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense iii increased producer compensation due to higher revenue and iv higher accrued performance bonuses employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 550 for 2020 as compared to 547 for the year ended december 31 2019

other operating expenses

other operating expenses represented 140 of total revenues for 2020 as compared to 158 for the year ended december 31 2019 other operating expenses for 2020 decreased 111 million or 29 from the same period of 2019 the net decrease included i lower variable operating expenses including such items as travel  entertainment meetings and professional fees resulting from responses to covid19 partially offset by ii 226 million of other operating expenses related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2019 and iii the writeoff recorded in 2020 of certain receivables in one of our programs where it was determined the collectability was in doubt 

gain or loss on disposal

the company recognized gains on disposal of 24 million in 2020 and 100 million in 2019 the change in the gain on disposal was due to activity associated with book of business sales although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or because doing so is in the company’s best interest

amortization

amortization expense for 2020 increased 32 million to 1085 million or 31 over 2019 the increase reflects the amortization of new intangible assets from recently acquired businesses partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized

depreciation

depreciation expense for 2020 increased 29 million to 263 million or 122 over 2019 changes in depreciation expense reflect the addition of fixed assets resulting from capital projects related to our multiyear technology investment program and other business initiatives net additions of fixed assets resulting from businesses acquired in the past 12 months partially offset by fixed assets which became fully depreciated

interest expense

interest expense for 2020 decreased 47 million to 590 million or 74 from 2019 the decrease is due to the decrease in interest rates associated with our floating rate debt balances partially offset by higher average debt balances from increased borrowings in 2020

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair value of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase price arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration the recorded purchase price for acquisitions includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years

 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2020 the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 as defined in asc 820fair value measurement the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were as follows

 



 

 

 

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the fair value of estimated earnout payables was reevaluated and decreased by 118 million for 2020 and decreased by 73 million for 2019 which resulted in a credit net of interest expense accretion to the consolidated statement of income for 2020 and 2019

as of december 31 2020 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 2589 million of which 792 million was recorded as accounts payable and 1797 million was recorded as other noncurrent liabilities as of december 31 2019 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 1615 million of which 179 million was recorded as accounts payable and 1436 million was recorded as other noncurrent liabilities

income taxes

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 230 in 2020 and 242 in 2019 the reduction in the effective tax rate in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily driven the tax benefit associated with additional vesting of stock awards in 2020 as compared to 2019

results of operations — segment information

as discussed in note 17 “segment information” of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services on a segmented basis changes in amortization depreciation and interest expenses generally result from activity associated with acquisitions likewise other income in each segment reflects net gains primarily from legal settlements and miscellaneous income as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment management focuses on the organic revenue growth rate of core commissions and fees the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues

for further discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line term loan agreements and international operations

our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable debt securities nonmarketable debt securities certificates of deposit us treasury securities and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds these investments are subject to interest rate risk the fair values of our invested assets at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date

as of december 31 2020 we had 5600 million of borrowings outstanding under our various credit agreements all of which bear interest on a floating basis tied to london interbank overnight rate “libor” and is therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense the effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as of july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority “fca” has urged banks and institutions to discontinue their use of the libor benchmark rate for floating rate debt and other financial instruments tied to the rate after 2021 however on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration limited “iba” announced that it would consult in early december 2020 on its intention to cease the publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31 2021 and the remaining us dollar libor settings overnight and one three six and 12 months immediately following the libor publication on june 30 2023 the consultation was open for feedback until january 25 2021 and iba “intends to share the results of the consultation with the fca and to publish a feedback statement summarizing responses from the consultation shortly thereafter” in connection to the released statement from the iba on december 4 2020 the fca released a similar statement in support of the continuation of the libor rate beyond 2021 the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” have recommended the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the best alternative rate to libor post discontinuance and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of sofr from libor 

the company is currently evaluating the transition from libor as an interest rate benchmark to other potential alternative reference rates including but not limited to the sofr interest rate management will continue to actively assess the related opportunities and risks associated with the transition and monitor related proposals and guidance published by arrc and other alternativerate initiatives with an expectation that we will be prepared to for a termination of libor benchmarks after 2021

we are subject to exchange rate risk primarily in our ukbased wholesale brokerage business that has a cost base principally denominated in british pounds and a revenue base in several other currencies but principally in us dollars and in our canadian mga business that has substantially all of its revenues and cost base denominated in canadian dollars as of january 14 2021 the company announced the completion of the acquisition of o’leary insurances an ireland based retail brokerage business which has substantially all of its revenue and cost base in euro dollars 

based upon our foreign currency rate exposure as of december 31 2020 an immediate 10 hypothetical changes of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 9a controls and procedures

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

we carried out an evaluation the “evaluation” required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” as of december 31 2020 based upon the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our senior management including our ceo and cfo to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures

changes in internal controls

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2020 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

employees

at december 31 2019 the company had 10083 employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions 1 protecting our confidential information and trade secrets 2 restricting their ability postemployment to solicit the business of our customers and 3 preventing the hiring of our employees for a period of time after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon applicable law and factual circumstances the majority of our employment relationships are atwill and terminable by either party at any time however the covenants regarding confidential information and nonsolicitation of our customers and employees generally extend for a period of at least two years after cessation of employment

none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based upon innovation knowledge terms and conditions of coverage quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines insurance business while it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals purchasing insurance over the internet we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with singleline coverage or small businesses that do not have a complex insurance program which represent a small portion of our overall retail segment

regulation licensing and agency contracts

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states and international jurisdictions are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses we endeavor to monitor the licensing of our employees but the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in a particular jurisdiction in addition to being subjected to fines

 item 1a risk factors

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to and could be materially adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results we present these risk factors grouped by category and the risks factors contained in each respective category are presented in order of their relative priority to us

risks related to our business 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected

 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key personnel were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key personnel are generally prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a twoyear period following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized sales and service operating model the loss of our senior leaders or other key personnel or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future or which if consummated may not be advantageous to us

our growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and continuously improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that may have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of operating performance could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges

a cybersecurity attack or any other interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation

we rely on information technology and thirdparty vendors to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report information to carriers and which often involves secure processing of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions any of which could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business

additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack in the future any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard customers’ information or financial losses such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain

while we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives policies and resources and employee training entirely eliminating all risk of improper access to private information is not possible the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase as these threats evolve cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation

 

rapid technological change may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions

we are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences

we are currently underway with a multiyear plan to upgrade many of our technology platforms and anticipate investing a total of 30 million to 40 million which will have an impact on our operating margins and cash flow during this period we have not determined however if additional resources and time for development and implementation may be required which if required may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions or impacts to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio regularly or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with thirdparty vendors for example the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation “gdpr” in may 2016 that replaced the former eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr became fully effective in may 2018 and requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices in addition legislators and regulators in the us have enacted and are proposing new and more robust privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations in light of the recent broadbased cyberattacks at a number of companies including but not limited to the new york state department of financial services cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies and the california consumer privacy act of 2018

these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share

for the year ended december 31 2019 no insurance company accounted for more than 40 of our total core commissions for each of the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 approximately 50 of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should this insurance company seek to terminate its arrangements with us or to otherwise decrease the number of insurance policies underwritten for us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could result

 

because our business is highly concentrated in arizona california florida georgia illinois indiana kentucky massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia washington and wisconsin adverse economic conditions natural disasters or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in arizona california florida georgia illinois indiana kentucky massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia washington and wisconsin for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we derived 21063 million or 881 19765 million or 886 and 16926 million or 900 of our annualized revenue respectively from our operations located in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes particularly in florida where we have 52 offices and our headquarters as well as in texas where we have 20 offices earthquakes including in california where we have 29 offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms

our corporate culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy our business may be harmed

we believe that a significant contributor to our success has been our corporate culture as a lean decentralized highly competitive profitoriented sales and service organization as we grow including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our profitability andor our ability to retain and recruit people of the highest integrity and quality who are essential to our future success we may face pressure to change our culture as we grow particularly if we experience difficulties in attracting competent personnel who are willing to embrace our culture in addition as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture such as our decentralized sales and service operating model which could negatively impact our future success

we face a variety of risks in our services segement including our thirdparty claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance intermediary operations

our services segment including our thirdparty claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our insurance intermediary operations including the risks that















if any of these risks materialize our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the credit agreements that govern our debt contain various covenants and other limitations with which we must comply at december 31 2019 we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of these agreements however failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition in the event of certain defaults the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable if the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full

certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities

the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities in particular among other covenants our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain transactionrelated items “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and therefore our business

the annual consolidated financial statements and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and fraud a control system no matter how well conceived operated and tested can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected

 

our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by certain actual and potential claims regulatory actions and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims regulatory actions and other proceedings including those relating to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business of which we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome with certainty because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based upon allegations that our employees or subagents failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years where appropriate we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by further changes in the usbased credit markets

although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2022 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

certain of our existing shareholders have significant control of the company

at december 31 2019 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 167 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his son j powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 157 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies

we have operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability

we have operations in the united kingdom bermuda canada and the cayman islands in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including











 

















we are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment and to the extent we use debt to finance our investments changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income

as of july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority “fca” has urged banks and institutions to discontinue their use of the london interbank overnight rate “libor” benchmark rate for floating rate debt and other financial instruments tied to the rate after 2021 to help with the transition the federal reserve board and new york fed have commissioned the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” comprised of a diverse set of privatesector entities that have an important presence in markets affected by usd libor and a wide array of officialsector entities including banking and financial sector regulators as exofficio members the arrc have recommended the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the best alternative rate to libor post discontinuance and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of sofr from libor 

as of december 31 2019 the company’s primary exposure are debt instruments referencing liborbased rates which includes the amended and restated credit agreement the “amended and restated credit agreement” term loan balance of 3300 million and 1000 million on the revolving credit facility outstanding and matures in june 2022 as well as the term loan credit agreement the “term loan credit agreement” which had an outstanding balance of 2850 million and matures in december 2023 as such any potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital interest rate exposure and net investment income cannot yet be determined in addition any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of any liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the company is currently evaluating the transition from libor as an interest rate benchmark to other potential alternative reference rates including but not limited to the sofr interest rate management will continue to actively asses the related opportunities and risks associated with the transition and monitor related proposals and guidance published by arrc and other alternativerate initiatives with an expectation the we will be prepared to for a termination of libor benchmarks after 2021

risks related to our industry 

our current market share may decrease as a result of disintermediation within the insurance industry including increased competition from insurance companies technology companies and the financial services industry as well as the shift away from traditional insurance markets

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition and to the extent that banks securities firms private equity funds and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediary services

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we collaborate and compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets

 

current us or global economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

if economic conditions were to worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates the financial insolvency of insurance companies or the reduced ability of customers to pay also if general economic conditions are poor some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these customers are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties that could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer to our customers we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our customers may be more expensive or limited

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business policy renewals and payments from insurance companies may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies generally during the prior year over the last three years these commissions generally have been in the range of 30 to 35 of our previous year’s total core commissions and fees due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect our results of operations profitability and our financial condition

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic”

we maintain cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at numerous depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail or be taken over by the fdic our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in regulations

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such 

 

arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations

we conduct business in each of the fifty states of the united states of america and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of those states the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders and it is difficult to anticipate how changes in such regulation would be implemented and enforced as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs technology compliance restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices determining technology and data protection requirements establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and new york as well as certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business certain federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the affordable care act and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules regulations or interpretations thereof will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2019 fiscal year we have 37461 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2019 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see note 1“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 4“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting”

 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising the company is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year we assess the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 201 9  201 8 and 201 7  

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

general

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures” below regarding important information on nongaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including loss experience risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control

we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2019 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues declined 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 24 billion in 2019 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 132 in the same 26year period we increased net income from 81 million to 3985 million in 2019 a compound annual growth rate of 162

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units changes in premium rate levels changes in general economic and competitive conditions and the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we foster a strong decentralized sales and service culture that leverages the broad capabilities and scale of our organization with the goal of consistent sustained growth over the longterm

the term “organic revenue” a nongaap measure is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first 12 months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period and for the calculation of organic revenue growth in 2018 only iii the impact of the adoption of accounting standards update no201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” and accounting standards codification topic 340 – other assets and deferred cost the “new revenue standard” in order to be on a comparable basis with 2017 the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered “organic revenue” is reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our customers’ exposure units iii net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners and iv the net change in fees paid to us by our customers organic revenue is reported in “results of operations” and in “results of operations  segment information” of this annual report on form 10k

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions which are included in our commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior years prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard these commissions were recorded to income when received as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard these commissions are now accrued based upon the placement of policies during the year and the expected payments to be received over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 30 of commissions and fees revenue

certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” in lieu of profitsharing contingent commissions gscs are accrued throughout the year based upon actual premiums written for the year ended december 31 2019 we had earned 231 million of gscs of which 127 million remained accrued at december 31 2019 and most of this will be collected over the first and second quarters of 2020 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we earned 231 million and 100 million respectively from gscs

combined our profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 164 million over 2018 the net increase of 164 million was mainly driven by i a gsc of approximately 9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for the national programs segment that will not recur in the future as the associated multiyear contract has ended and ii to a lesser extent growth associated with acquisitions completed over the last 12 months

fee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers as well as fees negotiated in lieu of commissions and are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by 1 our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies and 3 our retail segment in our 

 

largeaccount customer base  where we primarily earn fees for securing insurance for our customers and in our automobile dealer services “fi” businesses where we primarily earn fees for assisting our customers with selling warranty and service programs  fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 271  in 201 9 and 263  in 201 8  

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 our commissions and fees growth rate was 187 and 82 respectively and our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 36 and 24 respectively in the event that the gradual increases in insurable exposure units that occurred in the past few years continues through 2020 and premium rate changes are similar with 2019 we believe we will continue to see positive quarterly organic revenue growth rates in 2020

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous income

income before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2019 increased over 2018 by 635 million primarily as a result of net new business and acquisitions completed since 2018 in addition to leveraging expenses partially offset by additional interest expense and amortization associated with the acquisitions over the past two years with the largest being our acquisition of the hays group inc and certain of its affiliates “hays”

information regarding nongaap measures

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide references to the following nongaap financial measures as defined in regulation g of sec rules organic revenue organic revenue growth ebitdac and ebitdac margin we view these nongaap financial measures as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments because they allow us to determine a more comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth and operating performance that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year we believe that organic revenue provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance and view organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our four segments organic revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing organic revenue growth we also use organic revenue growth and ebitdac margin for incentive compensation determinations for executive officers and other key employees we view ebitdac and ebitdac margin as important indicators of operating performance because they allow us to determine more comparable but nongaap measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner by removing the significant noncash items of depreciation amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and also interest expense and taxes which are reflective of investment and financing activities not operating performance

these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this annual report on form 10k we present such nongaap supplemental financial information because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe they provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis we believe these nongaap financial measures improve the comparability of results between periods by eliminating the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments this supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to not in lieu of our consolidated financial statements

tabular reconciliations of this supplemental nongaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10k under “results of operation  segment information”

acquisitions

part of our business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries and service organizations to join our operations from 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2019 we acquired 536 insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts

on november 15 2018 we completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of hays at closing we delivered a payment of 705 million consisting of 605 million in cash and the issuance to certain key owners of hays of 3376103 shares of our common stock for a total value of 1000 million in addition the company may pay additional consideration to hays in the form of earnout payments in the aggregate amount of up to 250 million in cash over three years which is subject to certain conditions and the successful achievement of average annual ebitda targets for the acquired business during 2019 2020 and 2021 this transaction was initially funded through utilization of the company’s revolving line of credit within our credit facility details of which can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition” “results of operations” and note 9 “longterm debt” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements”

 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based upon historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the recognition of revenues expenses carrying values of our assets and liabilities of which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates

we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition business combinations and purchase price allocations intangible asset impairments noncash stockbased compensation and reserves for litigation in particular the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment to be made by management different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations refer to note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of the impacts for adopting accounting standards update no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” and no 201602 “leases topic 842”

revenue recognition

the majority of our revenue is commissions derived from our performance as agents and brokers acting on behalf of insurance carriers to sell products to customers that are seeking to transfer risk and conversely acting on behalf of those customers in negotiating with insurance carriers seeking to acquire risk in exchange for premiums in these arrangements our performance obligation is complete upon the effective date of the bound policy as such that is when the associated revenue is recognized where the company’s performance obligations have been completed but the final amount of compensation is unknown due to variable factors we estimate the amount of such compensation we recognize subsequent commission adjustments upon our receipt of additional information or final settlement whichever occurs first

to a lesser extent the company earns revenues in the form of fees like commissions fees paid to us in lieu of commission are recognized upon the effective date of the bound policy when we are paid a fee for service however the associated revenue is recognized over a period of time that coincides with when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of our work which characterizes most of our claims processing arrangements and various services performed in our property and casualty and employee benefits practices other fees are typically recognized upon the completion of the delivery of the agreedupon services to the customer

management determines a policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances

please see note 2 “revenues” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding the nature and timing of our revenues

business combinations and purchase price allocations

we have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses these assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the acquisition method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals of delivery of services however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from 3 to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized

acquisition purchase prices are typically based upon a multiple of average ebitda annual operating profit andor core revenue earned over a one to threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions where an earnout is part of the negotiated transaction subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when changes to the expected performance of the associated business are realized

 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” or on a discounted cash flow basis

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable any of the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii a significant negative industry or economic trend and iii a significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2019 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

noncash stockbased compensation

we grant nonvested stock awards to our employees with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards during the performance measurement period we review the probable outcome of the performance conditions associated with our performance awards and align the expense accruals with the expected performance outcome

investment income

investment income increased to 58 million in 2019 compared with 27 million in 2018 the increase was due to additional interest income driven by higher interest rates and cash management activities to earn a higher yield on excess cash balances

 

other income net 

other income for 2019 was 17 million compared with 16 million in 2018 other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income

employee compensation and benefits

employee compensation and benefits expense increased 224 or 2393 million in 2019 compared to 2018 this increase included 1644 million of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2018 therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2019 and 2018 increased by 748 million or 72 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i an increase in teammates for certain of our higher growth businesses ii an increase in bonus expense driven by the attainment of various revenue and profit targets within our businesses ii increased producer commissions due to higher revenue iii an increase in staff salaries attributable to salary inflation iv the increase in the value of deferred compensation liabilities driven by changes in the market prices of our employees investment elections which was substantially offset by other operating expenses and v an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to the betterthanexpected company performance related to our equity compensation plan and teammate retention employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 547 for 2019 as compared to 531 for the year ended december 31 2018

gain or loss on disposal

the company recognized gains on disposal of 100 million in 2019 and 22 million in 2018 the change in the gain on disposal was due to activity associated with book of business sales although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or because doing so is in the company’s best interest

amortization

amortization expense for 2019 increased 188 million to 1053 million or 217 over 2018 the increase reflects the amortization of new intangible assets from recently acquired businesses partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized

depreciation

depreciation expense for 2019 increased 06 million to 234 million or 26 over 2018 the increase was due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from capital projects related to our multiyear technology investment program and other business initiatives net additions of fixed assets resulting from recent acquisitions partially offset by fixed assets which became fully depreciated

interest expense

interest expense for 2019 increased 231 million to 637 million or 569 over 2018 the increase was due to the debt issued as a result of acquisitions over the past two years with the largest being our acquisition of hays and to a lesser extent a rise in interest rates associated with our outstanding floating rate debt balances

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair value of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase price arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years

 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2019 the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 as defined in asc 820fair value measurement the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were as follows

 



 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the fair value of estimated earnout payables was reevaluated and decreased by 73 million for 2019 and increased by 06 million for 2018 which resulted in a credit net of interest expense accretion to the consolidated statement of income for 2019 and net charges for 2018

as of december 31 2019 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 1615 million of which 179 million was recorded as accounts payable and 1436 million was recorded as other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2018 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 899 million of which 211 million was recorded as accounts payable and 688 million was recorded as other noncurrent liability

income taxes

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 242 in 2019 and 256 in 2018 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax reform act” made changes to the us tax code that affected our income tax rate beginning in 2017 the tax reform act reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 and requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings from foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years the tax reform act also established new tax laws that became effective january 1 2018 the 2018 and 2019 effective tax rates reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate the reduction in the effective tax rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 was driven by changes in our state tax footprint and corresponding apportionment as well as changes to tax rates in certain states the effective tax rates for 2018 and 2019 reflect the adoption of fasb accounting standards update 201609 “improvements to employee share based payment accounting” “asu 201609” in the first quarter of 2017 asu 201609 which requires upon vesting of stockbased compensation that any tax implications be treated as a discrete credit to the income tax expense in the quarter of vesting amends guidance issued in asc topic 718 compensation  stock compensation

for further discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line term loan agreements and international operations

our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable debt securities nonmarketable debt securities certificates of deposit us treasury securities and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds these investments are subject to interest rate risk the fair values of our invested assets at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date

as of december 31 2019 we had 7150 million of borrowings outstanding under our various credit agreements all of which bear interest on a floating basis tied to london interbank overnight rate “libor” and is therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense the effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as of july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority has urged banks and institutions to discontinue their use of the libor benchmark rate for floating rate debt and other financial instruments tied to the rate after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” have recommended the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the best alternative rate to libor post discontinuance and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of sofr from libor 

 

the company is currently evaluating the transition from libor as an interest rate benchmark to other potential alternative reference rates including but not limited to the sofr interest rate management will continue to actively asses the related opportunities and risks associated with the transition and monitor related proposals and guidance published by arrc and other alternativerate initiatives with an expectation the we will be prepared to for a termination of libor benchmarks after 2021  

we are subject to exchange rate risk primarily in our ukbased wholesale brokerage business that has a cost base principally denominated in british pounds and a revenue base in several other currencies but principally in us dollars based upon our foreign currency rate exposure as of december 31 2019 an immediate 10 hypothetical changes of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

we carried out an evaluation the “evaluation” required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” as of december 31 2019 based upon the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our senior management including our ceo and cfo to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures

changes in internal controls

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2019 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key personnel were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key personnel are generally prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a twoyear period following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized sales and service operating model the loss of our senior leaders or other key personnel or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future or which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and continuously improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that may have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of operating performance could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

a cybersecurity attack or any other interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and reputation 

we rely on information technology and third party vendors to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report information to carriers and which often involves secure processing of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions any of which could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business 

additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack in the future any material breaches of cybersecurity or media reports of the same even if untrue could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of clients and revenue loss of proprietary data regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain 

while we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives policies and resources and employee training entirely eliminating all risk of improper access to private information is not possible the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase as these threats evolve cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult to detect defend against and remediate any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and reputation 

rapid technological change may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions 

we are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we are currently underway with a multiyear plan to upgrade many of our technology platforms and anticipate investing a total of 30 million to 40 million which will have an impact on our operating margins and cash flow during this period we have not determined however if additional resources and time for development and implementation may be required which if required may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions or impacts to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio regularly or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements these laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors for example the european union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation “gdpr” in may 2016 that replaced the former eu data protection directive and related countryspecific legislation the gdpr became fully effective in may 2018 and requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices in addition legislators and regulators in the us have enacted and are proposing new and more robust privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations in light of the recent broadbased cyber attacks at a number of companies including but not limited to the new york state department of financial services cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 

these and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies adding to our it and compliance costs in addition enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2018  no insurance company accounted for more than 50 of our total core commissions for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  approximately 50 and 60 respectively of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should this insurance company seek to terminate its arrangements with us or to otherwise decrease the number of insurance policies underwritten for us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could result 

because our business is highly concentrated in arizona california florida georgia illinois indiana kentucky massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia washington and wisconsin adverse economic conditions natural disasters or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in arizona california florida georgia illinois indiana kentucky massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia washington and wisconsin for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  we derived 19765 million or 886 16926 million or 900 and 15740 million or 891 of our annualized revenue respectively from our operations located in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes particularly in florida where we have 46 offices and our headquarters as well as in texas where we have 14 offices earthquakes including in california where we have 24 offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

our corporate culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy our business may be harmed 

we believe that a significant contributor to our success has been our corporate culture as a lean decentralized highly competitive profitoriented sales and service organization as we grow including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our profitability andor our ability to retain and recruit people of the highest integrity and quality who are essential to our future success we may face pressure to change our culture as we grow particularly if we experience difficulties in attracting competent personnel who are willing to embrace our culture in addition as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture such as our decentralized sales and service operating model which could negatively impact our future success 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the credit agreements that govern our debt contain various covenants and other limitations with which we must comply at december 31 2018  we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of these agreements however failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition in the event of certain defaults the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable if the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities in particular among other covenants our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain transactionrelated items “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and therefore our business 

the annual consolidated financial statements and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and fraud a control system no matter how well conceived operated and tested can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by certain actual and potential claims regulatory actions and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims regulatory actions and other proceedings including those relating to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business of which we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome with certainty because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based upon allegations that our employees or subagents failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies 

with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years where appropriate we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by further changes in the usbased credit markets 

although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2022 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our existing shareholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2018  our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 167 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his son j powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 158 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

we have operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

we have operations in the united kingdom bermuda canada and the cayman islands in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 

 • political and economic instability including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war 

• coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws 

 • adverse changes in tax rates 

• variations in foreign currency exchange rates 

• legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices 

• governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from us including to or from our operations outside the united states and 



risks related to our industry 

our current market share may decrease as a result of disintermediation within the insurance industry including increased competition from insurance companies technology companies and the financial services industry as well as the shift away from traditional insurance markets 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition and to the extent that banks securities firms private equity funds and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediary services 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we collaborate and compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets 

current us economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

if economic conditions were to worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in values of insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates the financial insolvency of insurance companies or the reduced ability of customers to pay also if general economic conditions are poor some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these customers are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties that could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer to our customers we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our customers may be more expensive or limited 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business policy renewals and payments from insurance companies may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies generally during the prior year over the last three years these commissions generally have been in the range of 30 to 35 of our previous year’s total core commissions and fees due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the volume of business that we place with them and are 

generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect our results of operations profitability and our financial condition 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

we maintain cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at numerous depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail or be taken over by the fdic our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in regulations 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in each of the fifty states of the united states of america and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of those states the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders and it is difficult to anticipate how changes in such regulation would be implemented and enforced as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs technology compliance restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices determining technology and data protection requirements establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and new york as well as certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business certain federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the affordable care act and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules regulations or interpretations thereof will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2018 fiscal year we have 34328 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2018 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see note 1“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 4“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising the company is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year we assess the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

risks related to investing in our securities 

our credit ratings are subject to change 

our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our securities agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing agency each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry changes to the tax code and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures” below regarding important information on nongaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including loss experience risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2018  with the exception of 2009 when our revenues dropped 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 20 billion in 2018  reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 130 in the same 25year period we increased net income from 81 million to 3443 million in 2018  a compound annual growth rate of 162 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units changes in premium rate levels changes in general economic and competitive conditions and the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we foster a strong decentralized sales and service culture with the goal of consistent sustained growth over the longterm 

the term “organic revenue” a nongaap measure is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period and iii the impact of the adoption of accounting standards update no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” and accounting standards codification topic 340 – other assets and deferred cost the “new revenue standard” effective january 1 2018 the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered “organic revenue” is reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our customers’ exposure units iii net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners iv the net change in fees paid to us by our customers and v fees earned based upon claim processing volumes within our services segment organic revenue is reported in “results of operations” and in “results of operations  segment information” of this form 10k 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions which are included in our commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior years prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard these commissions were recorded to income when received over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 31 of the previous year’s commissions and fees revenue 

certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” in lieu of profitsharing contingent commissions gscs are accrued throughout the year based upon actual premiums written for the year ended december 31 2018  we had earned 100 million of gscs of which 89 million remained accrued at december 31 2018 as most of this will be collected over the first and second quarters of 2019 for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we earned 100 million 104 million and 115 million respectively from gscs 

combined our profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 33 million over 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the national programs segments other income decreased by 208 million primarily as a result of a legal settlement recognized in the first quarter of 2017 

fee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers as well as fees negotiated in lieu of commissions and are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by 1 our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies and to a lesser extent 

3 our retail segment in our largeaccount customer base fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 198 in 2018  315 in 2017 and 313 in 2016  

for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  our commissions and fees growth rate was 82 and 54  respectively and our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 24 and 44  respectively in the event that the gradual increases in insurable exposure units that occurred in the past few years continues through 2019 and premium rate changes are similar with 2018 we believe we will continue to see positive quarterly organic revenue growth rates in 2019 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous income 

income before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2018 increased over 2017 by 127 million  primarily as a result of net new business and acquisitions completed in the past twelve months offset by lower weather related claims processing revenues in 2018 and a legal settlement recorded in the first quarter of 2017 

information regarding nongaap measures 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we provide references to the following nongaap financial measures as defined in regulation g of sec rules organic revenue organic revenue growth ebitdac and ebitdac margin we view these nongaap financial measures as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments because they allow us to determine a more comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth and operating performance that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year we believe that organic revenue provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance and view organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our four segments organic revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing organic revenue growth we also use organic revenue growth and ebitdac margin for incentive compensation determinations for executive officers and other key employees we view ebitdac and ebitdac margin as important indicators of operating performance because they allow us to determine more comparable but nongaap measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner by removing the significant noncash items of depreciation amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and also interest expense and taxes which are reflective of investment and financing activities not operating performance 

these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this annual report on form 10k we present such nongaap supplemental financial information because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe they provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis we believe these nongaap financial measures improve the comparability of results between periods by eliminating the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments this supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to not in lieu of our consolidated financial statements 

tabular reconciliations of this supplemental nongaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10k under “results of operation  segment information” 

acquisitions 

part of our business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2018  we acquired 513 insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts during the year ended december 31 2018  the company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of twenty insurance intermediaries all of the stock of three insurance intermediaries and one book of business customer accounts collectively these acquired businesses had annualized revenues of approximately 3232 million 

on november 15 2018 we completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the hays group inc and certain of its affiliates collectively “hays” at closing we delivered a payment of 705 million consisting of 605 million in cash and the issuance to certain key owners of hays of 3376103 shares of our common stock for a total value of 1000 million in addition the company may pay additional consideration to hays in the form of earnout payments in the aggregate amount of up to 250 million in cash over three years which is subject to certain conditions and the successful achievement of average annual ebitda compound annual growth rate targets for the acquired business during 2019 2020 and 2021 hays was founded in 1994 providing employee benefits property  casualty and personal lines insurance and has grown to be the 22nd largest us broker as measured by business insurance magazine with headquarters in minneapolis hays operates across twentyone states increasing our presence in the midwest this transaction was initially funded through utilization of the company’s revolving line of credit within our credit facility details of which can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition”“results of operations” and note 9 “longterm debt” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based upon historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities of which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition business combinations and purchase price allocations intangible asset impairments noncash stockbased compensation and reserves for litigation in particular the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment to be made by management different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations refer to note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of the impacts for adopting accounting standards update no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is commissions derived from our performance as agents and brokers acting on behalf of insurance carriers to sell products to customers that are seeking to transfer risk and conversely acting on behalf of those customers in negotiating with insurance carriers seeking to acquire risk in exchange for premiums in these arrangements our performance obligation is complete upon the effective date of the bound policy as such that is when the associated revenue is recognized where the company’s performance obligations have been completed but the final amount of compensation is unknown due to variable factors we estimate the amount of such compensation we recognize subsequent commission adjustments upon our receipt of additional information or final settlement whichever occurs first 

to a lesser extent the company earns revenues in the form of fees like commissions fees paid to us in lieu of commission are recognized upon the effective date of the bound policy when we are paid a fee for service however the associated revenue is recognized over a period of time that coincides with when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of our work which characterizes most of our claims processing arrangements and various services performed in our employee benefits practices other fees are typically recognized upon the completion of the delivery of the agreedupon services to the customer 

management determines a policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances 

please see note 2 “revenues” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information regarding the nature and timing of our revenues 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses these assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the acquisition method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from 3 to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

acquisition purchase prices are typically based upon a multiple of average annual operating profit andor core revenue earned over a one to threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions where an earnout is part of the negotiated transaction subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when changes to the expected performance of the associated business are realized 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate 

reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” or on a discounted cash flow basis 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable any of the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii a significant negative industry or economic trend and iii a significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2018 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant nonvested stock awards to our employees with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

during the first quarter of 2017 the performance conditions for 326808 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2012 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2016 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2012 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share where the net income attributable to unvested awarded stock plans is excluded from the total net income attributable to common shares 

during the first quarter of 2018 the performance conditions for 260344 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2013 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2017 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2013 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable during the third quarter of 2018 the performance conditions for 2229561 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in july 2013 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on june 30 2018 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to seven years from the july 2013 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and in diluted net income per share where the net income attributable to unvested awarded stock plans is excluded from the total net income attributable to common shares 

during the first quarter of 2019 the performance conditions for approximately 20 million shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2014 and 2016 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2018 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to seven years from the 2014 grant date and five years from the 2016 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share 

litigation and claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows 

  





1 a nongaap measure 

nmf  not a meaningful figure 

commissions and fees 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2018  increased 1526 million to 20099 million  or 82 over 2017  core commissions and fees in 2018 increased 1493 million  of which 912 million represented core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2017  approximately 435 million represented net new and renewal business approximately 161 million related to the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard which was offset by 15 million related to commissions and fees revenue from businesses divested in 2017 and 2018 which reflected an organic revenue growth rate of 24  profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2018 increased by 33 million  or 52  compared to the same period in 2017  the net increase of 33 million was mainly driven by an increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the national programs segment 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2017  increased 945 million to 18573 million  or 54 over 2016  core commissions and fees in 2017 increased 974 million  of which approximately 277 million represented core commissions and fees from agencies acquired since 2016 that had no comparable revenues after accounting for divested business of 49 million  the remaining net increase of 746 million represented net new business which reflected an organic revenue growth rate of 44 for core commissions and fees profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2017 decreased by 29 million  or 45  compared to the same period in 2016  the net decrease of 29 million was mainly driven by a decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the retail and wholesale brokerage segments as a result of increased loss ratios and lower premium rates which was partially offset by an increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the national programs segment 

investment income 

investment income increased to 27 million in 2018  compared with 16 million in 2017 and increased to 16 million in 2017  compared with 15 million in 2016  the increases in both years were due to additional interest income driven by higher interest rates and cash management activities to earn a higher yield on excess cash balances 

other income net 

other income for 2018 was 16 million  compared with 224 million in 2017 and 24 million in 2016  other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income in 2017 200 million of other income was recognized as a result of a legal settlement with assuredpartners 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased 75  or 743 million  in 2018 over 2017  this increase included 348 million of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2017  therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2018 and 2017 increased by 395 million or 39 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i an increase in staff salaries attributable to salary inflation higher volumes in portions of our business and the mix of business across the company ii increased producer commissions due to higher revenue partially offset by iii a decrease of approximately 88 million in commission expense as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard which requires the deferral of incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and iv the increase in the value of corporateowned life insurance policies associated with our deferred compensation plan which is substantially offset in other operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 531 for 2018 as compared to 529 for the year ended december 31 2017  

employee compensation and benefits expense increased 75  or 694 million  in 2017 over 2016  this increase included 111 million of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2016  therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2017 and 2016 increased by 583 million or 64 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i higher bonuses due to increased revenue and operating profit as well as the additional cost associated with the retail segment’s performance incentive plan introduced in 2017 ii an increase in producer commissions driven by new and renewed business iii an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to forfeiture credits recognized in 2016 and iv increased staff salaries attributable to salary inflation and higher volumes in portions of our business employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 529 for 2017 as compared to 524 for the year ended december 31 2016  

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses in 2018 increased 172  or 486 million  over 2017  of which 140 million was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2017  the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2018 and 2017 increased by 347 million or 66 which was primarily attributable to i additional expenses associated with our investment in information technology and higher valueadded consulting services ii an increase of approximately 105 million for costs that had previously been reported on a net basis as contrarevenue prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard  iii the increase in the value of corporateowned life insurance policies associated with our deferred compensation plan which was substantially offset by employee compensation and benefits and partially offset by iv the benefits from our strategic purchasing program other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 165 in 2018 as compared to 151 for the year ended december 31 2017  

other operating expenses in 2017 increased 78  or 206 million  over 2016  of which 33 million was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2016  the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2017 and 2016  increased by 173 million or 66 which was primarily attributable to i higher data processing costs related to our multiyear technology investment program ii the receipt of certain premium tax refunds by our national flood program business in 2016 and iii professional fees at our national programs division other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 151 in 2017 and 149 in 2016  

gain or loss on disposal 

the company recognized gains on disposal of 22 million in 2018 and 2017 and 13 million in 2016  the change in the gain on disposal was due to activity associated with book of business sales although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or because doing so is in the company’s best interest 

amortization 

amortization expense increased 11 million  or 13  in 2018  and decreased 12 million  or 14  in 2017  the increase in 2018 is a result of the addition of intangibles associated with newly acquired businesses and the decrease in 2017 is a result of certain intangibles becoming fully amortized or otherwise written off as part of disposed businesses which was partially offset by the amortization of new intangibles from recently acquired businesses 

depreciation 

depreciation expense increased 01 million  or 06  in 2018  and increased 17 million  or 81 in 2017 as compared to 2016 these increases are due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from capital projects related to our multiyear technology investment program and other business initiatives 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 23 million  or 59  in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 12 million  or 30 in 2017 from 2016 the increase in 2018 was due primarily to the additional debt added in the fourth quarter with increased payments for newly acquired businesses as well as increased interest rate exposure on the company’s floating rate notes the decrease in 2017 was due primarily to having less total debt outstanding 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair value of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase price arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2018  the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 as defined in asc 820fair value measurement the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 were as follows 



for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  the fair value of estimated earnout payables was reevaluated and increased by 06 million  69 million and 63 million  respectively which resulted in charges to the consolidated statement of income

for further discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line term loan agreements and international operations 

our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable debt securities nonmarketable debt securities certificates of deposit us treasury securities and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds these investments are subject to interest rate risk the fair values of our invested assets at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017  approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date 

as of december 31 2018  we had 10150 million of borrowings outstanding under our various credit agreements all of which bear interest on a floating basis tied to libor and is therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense the effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are subject to exchange rate risk primarily in our ukbased wholesale brokerage business that has a cost base principally denominated in british pounds and a revenue base in several other currencies but principally in us dollars based upon our foreign currency rate exposure as of december 31 2018 an immediate 10 hypothetical changes of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants and financial disclosure 

there were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure in 2018 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation the “evaluation” required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” as of december 31 2018  based upon the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our senior management including our ceo and cfo to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2018  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines insurance business while it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals purchasing insurance over the internet we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with singleline coverage which represent a small portion of our overall retail segment 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states and international jurisdictions are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular jurisdiction

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to and could be materially adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results we present these risk factors grouped by category and the risks factors contained in each respective category are presented in order of their relative priority to us 

risks related to our business 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key personnel are prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a period of years following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future or which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and continuously improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and 

accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report information to carriers an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs while we have taken and continue to take actions to protect the security and privacy of our information entirely eliminating all risk of improper access to private information is not possible 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2017  no insurance company accounted for more than 50 of our total core commissions for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  approximately 60 and 73 respectively of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should this insurance company seek to terminate its arrangements with us or to otherwise decrease the number of insurance policies underwritten it writes for us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business and we could likely move our business to one of these other insurance companies although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result 

because our business is highly concentrated in arizona california florida georgia illinois indiana kentucky massachusetts michigan new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington adverse economic conditions natural disasters or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in arizona california florida georgia illinois indiana kentucky massachusetts michigan new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington for the years ended december 31 2017  2016 and 2015  we derived 16772 million or 891 15680 million or 888 and 14585 million or 878 of our revenue respectively from our operations located in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes particularly in florida where we have 41 offices and our headquarters as well as in texas where we have 10 offices and hurricane harvey made landfall in august 2017 earthquakes including in california where we have 23 offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

our corporate culture has contributed to our successs and if we cannot maintain this culture or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy our business may be harmed 

we believe that a significant contributor to our success has been our corporate culture as a lean decentralized highly competitive profitoriented sales and service organization as we grow including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our profitability andor our ability to retain and recruit people of the highest integrity and quality who are essential to our future success we may face pressure to change our culture as we grow particularly if we experience difficulties in attracting competent personnel who are willing to embrace our culture in addition as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures or if we experience a change in management management philosophy or business strategy we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture such as decentralization which could negatively impact our future success 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the credit agreements that govern our debt contain various covenants and other limitations with which we must comply at december 31 2017  we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of these agreements however failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition in the event of certain defaults the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable if the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities in particular among other covenants our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain transactionrelated items “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the annual consolidated financial statements and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

rapid technological change may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions 

we are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we are currently underway with a multiyear plan to upgrade many of our technology platforms and anticipate investing a total of 30 million to 40 million which will have an impact on our operating margins and cash flow during this period we have not determined however if additional resources and time for development and implementation may be required which if required may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions or impacts to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio regularly or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived operated and tested can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by certain actual and potential claims regulatory actions and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims regulatory actions and other proceedings including those relating to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business of which we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome with certainty because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based upon allegations that our employees or subagents failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years where appropriate we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by further changes in the usbased credit markets 

although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2022 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to 

consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our existing shareholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2017  our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 171 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his son j powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 163 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

we have operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

we have operations in the united kingdom bermuda canada and the cayman islands in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 

 • political and economic instability including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war 

• coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws 

 • adverse changes in tax rates 

• variations in foreign currency exchange rates 

• legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices 

• governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states and 

 risks related to our industry 

our current market share may decrease as a result of disintermediation within the insurance industry including increased competition from insurance companies technology companies and the financial services industry as well as the shift away from traditional insurance markets 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediary services 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets 

current us economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

if economic conditions were to worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in values of insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency of insurance companies or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers also if general economic conditions are poor some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these customers are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties which could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer our customers we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our customers may be more expensive or limited 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year these commissions generally have been in the range of 30 to 40 of our previous year’s total core commissions and fees over the last three years due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect our results of operations profitability and our financial condition 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

we maintain cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail or be taken over by the fdic our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in regulations 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance 

companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in each of the fifty states of the united states of america and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of those states the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders and it is difficult to anticipate how changes in such regulation would be implemented and enforced as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and new york as well as certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business certain federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the affordable care act and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules regulations or interpretations thereof will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2017 fiscal year we have 27161 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2017 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see note 1“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising the company is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year we assess the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 2017  2016 and 2015  

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

risks related to investing in our securities

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry changes to the tax code and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures” below regarding important information on nongaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including loss experience risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2017 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues dropped 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 19 billion in 2017 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 132 in the same 24year period we increased net income from 81 million to 3996 million in 2017 a compound annual growth rate of 176 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units changes in premium rate levels and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we foster a strong decentralized sales and service culture with the goal of consistent sustained growth over the longterm 

the term “organic revenue” a nongaap measure is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered “organic revenue” is reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our customers’ exposure units iii net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners and iv the net change in fees paid to us by our customers organic revenue is reported in the “results of operations  segment information” of this form 10k 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 32 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees profitsharing contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income in the year received 

certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” in lieu of profitsharing contingent commissions since gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based upon actual premiums written for the year ended december 31 2017  we had earned 104 million of gscs of which 85 million remained accrued at december 31 2017 as most of this will be collected in the first quarter of 2018 for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we earned 104 million 115 million and 100 million respectively from gscs 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by 1 our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies and to a lesser extent 3 our retail segment in our largeaccount customer base our services are provided over a period of time which is typically one year fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 315 in 2017  313 in 2016 and 306 in 2015  

additionally our profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for the year ended december 31 2017 decreased by 29 million over 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the retail and wholesale brokerage segments as a result of increased loss ratios and lower premium rates partially offset by an increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the national programs segment other income increased by 201 million primarily as a result of a legal settlement recognized in the first quarter of 2017 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  our commissions and fees growth rate was 54 and 64  respectively and our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 44 and 30  respectively additionally each of our four segments recorded positive organic revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2017  in the event that the gradual increases in insurable exposure units that occurred in the past few years continues through 2018 and premium rate changes are similar with 2017 we believe we will continue to see positive quarterly organic revenue growth rates in 2018 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous income 

income before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017 increased over 2016 by 262 million  primarily as a result of a legal settlement recorded in the first quarter of 2017 and net new business and acquisitions completed in the past twelve months 

information regarding nongaap measures 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding the following nongaap measures organic revenue organic revenue growth and organic revenue growth rate we view each of these nongaap measures as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments because they allow us to determine a comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year and that are expected to continue in the future these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this annual report on form 10k we believe that presenting these nongaap measures allows readers of our financial statements to measure analyze and compare our consolidated growth the growth of each of our segments and certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period in a meaningful and consistent manner that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments this supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to not in lieu of our consolidated financial statements 

tabular reconciliations of this supplemental nongaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10k under “results of operation  segment information” 

acquisitions 

part of our business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2017  we acquired 490 insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts during the year ended december 31 2017  the company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of eleven insurance intermediaries and one book of business customer accounts collectively these acquired business that had annualized revenues of approximately 175 million 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based upon historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities of which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition business combinations and purchase price allocations intangible asset impairments noncash stockbased compensation and reserves for litigation in particular the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment to be made by management different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations refer to note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of the impacts for adopting accounting standards update no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is processed into our systems and invoiced to the customer whichever is later commission revenues related to installment billings are recognized on the later of the date effective or invoiced with the exception of our arrowhead business which follows a policy of recognizing on the later of the date effective or processed into our systems regardless of the billing arrangement management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification from insurance companies concerning matters necessitating such adjustments profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is generally when such commissions are received from insurance 

companies or periodically when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues and commissions for employee benefits coverages and workers’ compensation programs are recognized as services are rendered please see note 1 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for changes to our revenue recognition policies that are effective january 1 2018 as prescribed by new accounting pronouncements 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses these assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the acquisition method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from 3 to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

acquisition purchase prices are typically based upon a multiple of average annual operating profit or core revenue earned over a one to threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when changes to the expected performance of the associated business are realized 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” or on a discounted cash flow basis 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable any of the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii a significant negative industry or economic trend and iii a significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2017 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant nonvested stock awards and to a lesser extent stock options to our employees with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

during the first quarter of 2016 the performance conditions for approximately 14 million shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2011 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2015 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2011 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees became eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date 

during the first quarter of 2017 the performance conditions for approximately 169000 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2012 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2016 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2012 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted eps 

during the first quarter of 2018 the performance conditions for 130172 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2013 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2017 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2013 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted eps 

litigation and claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017  2016 and 2015 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows 

  





1 a nongaap measure 

nmf  not a meaningful figure 

commissions and fees 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2017  increased 945 million to 18573 million  or 54 over 2016  core commissions and fees for 2017 increased 974 million  of which approximately 277 million represented core commissions and fees from agencies acquired since 2016 that had no comparable revenues after accounting for divested business of 49 million  the remaining net increase of 746 million represented net new business which reflects an organic revenue growth rate of 44 for core commissions and fees profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2017 decreased by 29 million  or 45  compared to the same period in 2016  the net decrease of 29 million was mainly driven by a decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the retail and wholesale brokerage segments as a result of increased loss ratios and lower premium rates which was partially offset by an increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the national programs segment 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2016  increased 1058 million to 17628 million  or 64 over 2015  core commissions and fees in 2016 increased 1021 million  of which approximately 617 million represented core commissions and fees from agencies acquired since 2015 that had no comparable revenues after accounting for divested business of 66 million  the remaining net increase of 470 million represented net new business which reflects an organic revenue growth rate of 30 for 

core commissions and fees profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2016 increased by 37 million  or 61  compared to the same period in 2015  the net increase of 37 million was mainly driven by an increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the retail segment which was partially offset by a decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions in the wholesale brokerage segment as a result of increased loss ratios 

investment income 

investment income increased to 16 million in 2017  compared with 15 million in 2016 and increased to 15 million in 2016  compared with 10 million in 2015  the increases in both years are due to additional interest income driven by higher average invested cash balances accompanied by higher effective earned rates of interest 

other income net 

other income for 2017 was 225 million  compared with 24 million in 2016 and 26 million in 2015  other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income in 2017 200 million of other income was recognized as a result of a legal settlement in the first quarter of 2017 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased 75  or 694 million  in 2017 over 2016  this increase included 111 million of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2016  therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2017 and 2016 increased by 583 million or 64 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i higher bonuses due to increased revenue and operating profit as well as the additional cost associated with the retail segment’s performance incentive plan introduced in 2017 ii an increase in producer commissions driven by new and renewed business iii an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to forfeiture credits recognized in 2016 and iv increased staff salaries attributable to salary inflation and higher volumes in portions of our business employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 529 for 2017 as compared to 524 for the year ended december 31 2016  

employee compensation and benefits expense increased 80  or 683 million  in 2016 over 2015  this increase included 233 million of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2015  therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2016 and 2015 increased by 450 million or 52 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i higher producer commissions driven by new and renewed business ii increased staff salaries that included some severance cost iii increased bonuses due to higher revenue and operating profit iv increased cost of health insurance and v an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to forfeiture credits recognized in 2015 employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 524 for 2016 as compared to 516 for the year ended december 31 2015  

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses in 2017 increased 78  or 206 million  over 2016  of which 33 million was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2016  the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2017 and 2016 increased by 173 million or 66 which was primarily attributable to i higher data processing costs related to our multiyear technology investment program ii the receipt of certain premium tax refunds by our national flood program business in 2016 and iii professional fees at our national programs division other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 151 in 2017  149 in 2016 and 151 in 2015  

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 149 in 2016 and 151 in 2015  other operating expenses in 2016 increased 118 million  or 47  over 2015  of which 95 million was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2015  the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2016 and 2015  increased by 23 million or 09 which was primarily attributable to higher data processing costs related to our multiyear technology investment program partially offset by the receipt of certain premium tax refunds by our national flood program business 

gain or loss on disposal 

the company recognized gains on disposal of 22 million  13 million and 06 million in 2017  2016 and 2015  respectively the change in the gain on disposal was due to activity associated with book of business sales although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or because doing so is in the company’s best interest 

amortization 

amortization expense decreased 12 million  or 14  in 2017  and decreased 08 million  or 09  in 2016  these decreases are as a result of certain intangibles becoming fully amortized or otherwise written off as part of disposed businesses both of which were partially offset with amortization of new intangibles from recently acquired businesses 

depreciation 

depreciation expense increased 17 million  or 81  in 2017 and remained flat in 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase in 2017 is due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from capital projects related to our multiyear technology investment program and other business initiatives in 2017 while the stable level of expense in 2016 versus 2015 reflected capital additions approximately equal to the value of prior capital additions that became fully depreciated 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 12 million  or 30  in 2017  and increased 02 million  or 06 in 2016  the decrease in 2017 was due primarily to having less total debt outstanding the increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in floating interest rates related to the outstanding debt balance on the credit facility term loan 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair value of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase price arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2017  the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 as defined in asc 820fair value measurement the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2017  2016 and 2015 were as follows 



for the years ended december 31 2017  2016 and 2015  the fair value of estimated earnout payables was reevaluated and increased by 69 million  63 million and 130 thousand  respectively which resulted in charges to the consolidated statement of income 

as of december 31 2017  the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 362 million  of which 251 million was recorded as accounts payable and 111 million was recorded as other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2016  the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 638 million  of which 318 million was recorded as accounts payable and 320 million was recorded as other noncurrent liability 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 111 in 2017  392 in 2016  and 396 in 2015  the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2017 was primarily driven by the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities as described in part ii note 9 “income taxes” in addition to adoption of fasb accounting standards update 201609 “improvements to employee share based payment accounting” “asu 201609” in the first quarter of 2017 asu 201609 which requires upon vesting of stockbased compensation any tax implications be treated as a discrete credit to the income tax expense in the quarter of vesting amends guidance issued in accounting standards codification “asc” topic 718 compensation  stock compensation the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2016 is driven by several permanent tax differences along with the apportionment of taxable income in the states where we operate 

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services on a segmented basis changes in amortization depreciation and interest expenses generally result from activity associated with acquisitions likewise other income in each segment reflects net gains primarily from legal settlements and miscellaneous income as such in evaluating the operational efficiency and leverage of a segment management focuses on the organic revenue growth rate of core commissions and fees the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line term loan agreements and international operations 

our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable debt securities nonmarketable debt securities certificates of deposit us treasury securities and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds these investments are subject to interest rate risk the fair values of our invested assets at december 31 2017 and december 31 2016  approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date 

as of december 31 2017  we had 3850 million of borrowings outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement which bears interest on a floating basis tied to the london interbank offered rate libor and is therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense the effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2017  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based upon innovation knowledge terms and condition of coverage quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines insurance business while it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals purchasing insurance over the internet we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with singleline coverage which represent a small portion of our overall retail segment 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states and international jurisdictions are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular jurisdiction

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to and could be materially adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results we present these risk factors grouped by macroeconomic factors market factors and operational factors and not in any order of potential magnitude of impact 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer our customers we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our customers may be more expensive or limited 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and continuously improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

because our business is highly concentrated in arizona california florida georgia illinois indiana kansas kentucky massachusetts michigan new jersey new york oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington adverse economic conditions natural disasters or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in arizona california florida georgia illinois indiana kansas kentucky massachusetts michigan new jersey new york oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we derived 15719 million or 890 14659 million or 883 and 13765 million or 874 of our revenues respectively from our operations located in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes particularly in florida where we have 41 offices and our 

headquarters earthquakes including california where we maintain a number of offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2016  no insurance company accounted for more than 60 of our total core commissions for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  approximately 73 and 70 respectively of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should this insurance company seek to terminate its arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business and we could likely move our business to one of these other insurance companies although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result 

our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies technology companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediary services 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year these commissions generally have been in the range of 30 to 50 of our previous year’s total core commissions and fees over the last three years due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations profitability and our financial condition 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

we maintain cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in regulations 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in each of the fifty states of the united states of america and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of those states the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and new york as well as certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules regulations or interpretations thereof will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

changes in laws and regulations may increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended “sarbanesoxley” and the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 have required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of these acts the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated and may continue to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects these developments have increased and may increase in the future our compliance costs may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

from time to time new regulations are enacted or existing requirements are changed and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the affordable care act and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or 

in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

we are subject to litigation which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are and may be subject to a number of claims regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome of these claims actions and proceedings with certainty 

an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based upon allegations that our employees or subagents failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years where appropriate we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

  while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by further changes in the usbased credit markets 

although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2019 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the credit agreements that govern our debt contain various covenants and other limitations with which we must comply at december 31 2016  we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of these agreements however failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition in the event of certain defaults the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable if the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities in particular among other covenants our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain transactionrelated items “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

our credit ratings are subject to change 

our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our securities agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing agency each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating 

we have operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

we have operations in the united kingdom bermuda and the cayman islands in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

   

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key personnel are prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a period of years following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2016  fiscal year we have 26754 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2016  and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see note 1“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising the company is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year we assess the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

current us economic conditions and the shift away from traditional insurance markets may continue to adversely affect our business 

if economic conditions were to worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in values of insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency of insurance companies or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers also if general economic conditions are poor some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these customers are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties which could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the annual consolidated financial statements and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

rapid technological change in our industry may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies may require us to make additional investments in the future we are currently underway with a multiyear plan to upgrade much of our technology platforms and anticipate investing 30 million to 40 million which will have an impact on our margins during this period we have not determined however if additional resources and time for development and implementation may be required which if required may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions or impacts to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report information to carriers an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs while we have taken and continue to take actions to protect the security and privacy of our information entirely eliminating all risk of improper access to private information is not possible 

we are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

certain of our existing shareholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2016  our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 160 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his son j powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 151 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

  

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived operated and tested can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry changes to the tax code and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures” below regarding important information on nongaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including loss experience risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2016 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues dropped 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 18 billion in 2016 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 135 in the same 23year period we increased net income from 81 million to 2575 million in 2016 a compound annual growth rate of 162 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units changes in premium rate levels and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we foster a strong decentralized sales and service culture with the goal of consistent sustained growth over the longterm 

the term “organic revenue” a nongaap measure is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered “organic revenue” is reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our customers’ exposure units iii net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners and iv the net change in fees paid to us by our customers organic revenue is reported in the results of operations and in the results of operations  segment sections of this form 10k 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 36 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income in the year received 

certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” in lieu of profitsharing contingent commissions since gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based upon actual premiums written for the year ended december 31 2016  we had earned 115 million of gscs of which 92 million remained accrued at december 31 2016  as most of this will be collected in the first quarter of 2017 for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we earned 115 million 100 million and 99 million respectively from gscs 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by 1 our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies and to a lesser extent 3 our retail segment in our largeaccount customer base our services are provided over a period of time which is typically one year fee revenues on a consolidated basis as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 313 in 2016  306 in 2015  and 306 in 2014  

additionally our profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for the year ended december 31 2016   increased  by 37 million  over 2015  primarily as a result of an increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the retail segment partially offset by a decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions in the wholesale brokerage segment as a result of increased loss ratios other income decreased  by 02 million  primarily as a result of a reduction in the gains on the sale of books of business when compared to 2015  and the change in where this activity is presented in the financial statements as described in the results of operations section below 

for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 30  and 26  respectively additionally each of our four segments recorded positive organic revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2016  in the event that the gradual increases in insurable exposure units that occurred in the past few years continues through 2017 and premium rate changes are similar with 2016 we believe we will continue to see positive quarterly organic revenue growth rates in 2017 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous income 

income before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2016   increased  over 2015  by 209 million  primarily as a result of acquisitions completed in the past twelve months and net new business

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding the following nongaap measures organic revenue organic revenue growth and organic revenue growth after adjusting for the significant revenue recorded at our former colonial claims operation in the first half of 2013 attributable to superstorm sandy “2014 total core commissions and feesadjusted” we view each of these nongaap measures as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments because they allow us to determine a comparable but nongaap measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year and that are expected to continue in the future these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this annual report on form 10k we believe that presenting these nongaap measures allows readers of our financial statements to measure analyze and compare our consolidated growth and the growth of each of our segments in a meaningful and consistent manner we present such nongaap supplemental financial information as we believe such information provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis our industry peers may provide similar supplemental nongaap information with respect to one or more of these measures although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments this supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to not in lieu of our consolidated financial statements 

tabular reconciliations of this supplemental nongaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10k under “results of operation  segment information” 

acquisitions 

part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through the fourth  quarter of 2016  we acquired 479  insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts during the year ended   december 31 2016  the company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of seven  insurance intermediaries all of the stock of one  insurance intermediary and three  books of business customer accounts collectively these acquired business that had annualized revenues of approximately 56 million 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based upon historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities of which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition business combinations and purchase price allocations intangible asset impairments noncash stockbased compensation and reserves for litigation in particular the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment to be made by management different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations refer to note 1 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is processed into our systems and invoiced to the customer whichever is later commission revenues related to installment billings are recognized on the later of the date effective or invoiced with the exception of our arrowhead business which follows a policy of recognizing on the later of the date effective or processed into our systems regardless of the billing arrangement management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification from insurance companies concerning matters necessitating such adjustments profitsharing 

contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is generally when such commissions are received from insurance companies or periodically when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues and commissions for employee benefits coverages and workers’ compensation programs are recognized as services are rendered 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the acquisition method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from 3 to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

acquisition purchase prices are typically based upon a multiple of average annual operating profit earned over a one to threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” or on a discounted cash flow basis 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable any of the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii a significant negative industry or economic trend and iii a significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2016 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant nonvested stock awards and to a lesser extent stock options to our employees with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

during the first quarter of 2016 the performance conditions for approximately 14 million shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2011 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2015 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2011 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees became eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date 

during the first quarter of 2017 the performance conditions for approximately 169000 shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2012 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2016 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2012 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted eps 

litigation and claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows

commissions and fees 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2016  increased   1058 million  to 17628 million  or 64  over 2015  core commissions and fees revenue for 2016   increased   1021 million  of which approximately 617 million  represented core commissions and fees from agencies acquired since 2015  that had no comparable revenues after accounting for divested business of 66 million  the remaining net increase of 470 million represented net new business which reflects a growth rate of 30  for core organic commissions and fees profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2016   increased  by 37 million  or 61  compared to the same period in 2015  the net increase of 37 million  was mainly driven by an increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in the retail segment partially offset by a decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions in the wholesale brokerage segment as a result of increased loss ratios 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2015  increased   895 million  to 16570 million  or 57  over the same period in 2014  core commissions and fees revenue in 2015   increased   953 million  of which approximately 766 million  represented core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2014  after accounting for divested business of 193 million  the remaining net increase of 380 million represented net new business which reflects a growth rate of 26  for core organic commissions and fees profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2015   decreased  by 58 million  or 86  compared 

to the same period in 2014  the net decrease of 58 million  was mainly driven by a decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions in the national programs segment as a result of increased loss ratios 

investment income 

investment income increased  to 15 million  in 2016  compared with 10 million  in 2015  due to additional interest income driven by higher average invested cash balances investment income increased  to 10 million  in 2015  compared with 07 million  in 2014  due to additional interest income driven by cash management activities to earn a higher yield 

other income net 

other income for 2016  was 24 million  compared with 26 million  in 2015  and 76 million  in 2014  other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income for 2016 and 2015 in 2014 other income included legal settlements and gains and loss on the sale and disposition of fixed assets as well as gains and losses from the sale on books of business customer accounts prior to the adoption of asu no 201408 “reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity” “asu 201408” in the fourth quarter of 2014 net gains and losses on the sale of businesses or customer accounts were reflected in other income any such gains or losses are now reflected on a net basis in the expense section since the adoption of asu 201408 we recognized gains of 13 million  06 million and 53 million from sales on books of business customer accounts in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased   80  or 683 million  in 2016  over 2015  this increase included 233 million  of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2015  therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2016  and 2015  increased by 450 million  or 52 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i an increase in producer commissions correlated to increased revenue ii increased staff salaries that included severance cost iii increased profit center bonuses due to increased revenue and operating profit iv the increased cost of health insurance and v an increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense due to forfeiture credits recognized in 2015 employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 524  for 2016  as compared to 516  for the year ended december 31 2015  

employee compensation and benefits expense increased 57  or 458 million  in 2015  over 2014  this increase included 263 million of compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2015  and 2014  increased by 195 million or 43 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i an increase in producer and staff salaries as we made targeted investments in our business ii increased profit center bonuses and commissions due to increased revenue and operating profit and iii the increased cost of health insurance employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 516  for 2015 as compared to 515  for the year ended december 31 2014  

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 149  in 2016  151  in 2015  and 149  in 2014  other operating expenses in 2016   increased   118 million  or 47  over 2015  of which 95 million  was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2015  the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2016  and 2015  increased by 23 million  or 09 which was primarily attributable to increased data processing related to the information technology spend for our multiyear investment program partially offset by the receipt of certain premium tax refunds by our national flood program business 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 151  in 2015  149  in 2014  and 144 in 2013 other operating expenses in 2015   increased   157 million  or 67  over 2014  of which 126 million  was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2014  the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2015  and 2014  increased by 31 million  or 13 which was primarily attributable to increased sales meetings legal and consulting expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with office rent telecommunications and bank fees 

gain or loss on disposal 

the company recognized a gain on disposal of 13 million  and 06 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively and a loss of 474 million  in 2014  the pretax loss for 2014 is the result of the disposal of the axiom re business as part of the company’s strategy to exit the reinsurance brokerage business prior to the adoption of asu 201408 in the fourth quarter of 2014 net gains and losses on the sale of businesses or customer accounts were reflected in other income although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or because doing so is in the company’s best interest in 2014 the company recognized 53 million in gains from sales on books of business customer accounts reported as other income 

amortization 

amortization expense decreased   08 million  or 09  in 2016  and increased   45 million  or 55  in 2015  the decrease for 2016 is a result of certain intangibles becoming fully amortized or otherwise written off as part of disposed businesses partially offset with amortization of new intangibles from recently acquired businesses the increase for 2015 is a result of the amortization of newly acquired intangibles being greater than the decrease associated with intangibles that became fully amortized or otherwise written off as part of disposed businesses during 2015 

depreciation 

depreciation expense increased 01 million  or 05  in 2016  and remained flat in 2015  these changes were due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 net of assets which became fully depreciated the increase in 2015 was due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from acquisitions completed since 2014 while the stable level of expense in 2016 versus 2015 reflected capital additions approximately equal to the value of prior capital additions that became fully depreciated 

interest expense 

interest expense increased   02 million  or 06  in 2016  and 108 million  or 382  in 2015  the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the increased debt borrowings and an increase in our effective rate of interest for the years ended  2015 and 2014 the increased debt borrowings from 2014 include the credit facility term loan entered into in may 2014 in the initial amount of 5500 million at libor plus 1375 basis points and the 5000 million senior notes due 2024 issued in september 2014 at a fixed rate of interest of 4200 the credit facility term loan proceeds replaced preexisting debt of 2300 million with similar rates of interest the proceeds from the senior notes due 2024 were used to settle the credit facility revolver debt of 3750 million which had a lower but variable rate of interest based upon an adjusted libor this transitioned the debt to a favorable longterm fixed rate of interest and extended the date of maturity of those funds these changes were the result of an evolution and maturation of our previous debt structure and provide increased debt capacity and flexibility the increase in 2016 versus 2015 is due to the rise in the floating interest rate of our credit facility term loan partially offset by the scheduled amortized principal payments on the credit facility term loan which has reduced the company’s average debt balance 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair value of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase price arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2016  the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 as defined in asc 820fair value measurement the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



for the years ended   december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  the fair value of estimated earnout payables was reevaluated and increased by 63 million  130 thousand  and 74 million  respectively which resulted in charges to the consolidated statement of income 

as of december 31 2016  the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 638 million  of which 318 million  was recorded as accounts payable and 320 million  was recorded as other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2015  the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 784 million  of which 253 million  was recorded as accounts payable and 531 million  was recorded as other noncurrent liability 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 392  in 2016  396  in 2015  and 391  in 2014  the decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by several permanent tax differences along with the apportionment of taxable income in the states where we operate 

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services on a segmented basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses generally result from completed acquisitions within a given segment within the preceding 12 months likewise other income in each segment reflects net gains primarily from legal settlements and miscellaneous income as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment management emphasizes the net organic revenue growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues

 there would have been a 35 organic growth rate when excluding the 183 million of revenues recorded at our colonial claims operation in the first half of 2013 related to superstorm sandy 

retail segment 

the retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 857  of the retail segment’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses are not correlated to changes in commissions on insurance premiums a significant portion of any fluctuation in the commissions we receive net of related producer compensation will result in a similar fluctuation in our income before income taxes unless we make incremental investments in the organization 

financial information relating to our retail segment is as follows

nmf  not a meaningful figure 

the retail segment’s total revenues in 2016   increased   54  or 471 million  over the same period in 2015  to 9174 million  the 443 million   increase  in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following i approximately 312 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015  ii 157 million related to net new business and iii an offsetting decrease of 26 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in 2015  and 2016  profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2016   increased   153  or 47 million  over 2015  to 350 million  the retail segment’s organic revenue growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 19  for 2016  and was driven by revenue from net new business written during the preceding twelve months along with modest increases in commercial auto rates and underlying exposure unit values that drive insurance premiums and partially offset by rate reductions in most lines of coverage other than commercial auto with the most pronounced declines realized for insurance premium rates for properties in catastropheprone areas 

income before income taxes for 2016   increased   33  or 61 million  over the same period in 2015  to 1880 million  this growth in income before income taxes was negatively impacted by 103 million in expense associated with the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables an increase of 82 million over the same period in 2015 other factors affecting this increase were i the net increase in revenue as described above ii a 63 or 290 million increase in employee compensation and benefits due primarily to the year on year impact of new teammates related to acquisitions completed in the past twelve months and to a lesser extent continued investment in producers and other staff to support current and future expected organic revenue growth and iii operating expenses which increased  by 88 million  or 64  primarily 

due to increased valueadded consulting services to support our customers and increases in office rent expense offset by a combined decrease in amortization depreciation and intercompany interest expense of 49 million 

the retail segment’s total revenues in 2015   increased   57  or 467 million  over the same period in 2014  to 8703 million  the 436 million   increase  in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following i approximately 356 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2014  ii 110 million related to net new business and iii an offsetting decrease of 30 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded from business divested in 2014  and 2015  profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2015   increased   34  or 10 million  over 2014  to 303 million  the retail segment’s organic revenue growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 14  for 2015  and was driven by revenue from net new business written during the preceding twelve months along with modest increases in commercial auto rates and partially offset by i terminated association health plans in the state of washington ii continued pressure on the small employee benefits business as some accounts adopt alternative plan designs and move to a per employeeper month payment model due to the implementation of the affordable care act and iii reductions in property insurance premium rates specifically in catastropheprone areas 

income before income taxes for 2015   increased   155  or 244 million  over the same period in 2014  to 1819 million  the primary factors affecting this increase were i the net increase in revenue as described above ii a 71 or 294 million increase in employee compensation and benefits due primarily to the year on year impact of new teammates related to acquisitions completed in the past twelve months in addition to incremental investments in revenue producing teammates and iii operating expenses which increased  by 38 million  or 29  due to increased travel and value added consulting services offset by iv a reduction in the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables of 55 million or 731 to 20 million and v a 42 million or 257 reduction in noncash stockbased compensation to 121 million due to the forfeiture of certain grants where performance conditions were not fully achieved 

national programs segment 

the national programs segment manages over 50 programs with approximately 40 wellcapitalized carrier partners in most cases the insurance carriers that support the programs have delegated underwriting and in many instances claimshandling authority to our programs operations these programs are generally distributed through a nationwide network of independent agents and brown  brown retail agents and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries trade groups professions public entities and market niches the national programs segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories professional programs arrowhead insurance programs commercial programs public entityrelated programs and the national flood program the national programs segment’s revenue is primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs segment is as follows 





1 a nongaap measure 

national programs total revenues in 2016   increased   46  or 198 million  over 2015  to a total 4485 million  the 176 million   increase  in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following i an increase of approximately 17 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2015  and ii 172 million related to net new business offset by iii a decrease of 13 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2015  from businesses since divested profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs were 173 million  in 2016  which was an increase  of 17 million  over 2015  which was primarily driven by the improved loss experience of our carrier partners 

the national programs segment’s organic revenue growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 42  for 2016  this organic revenue growth rate was mainly due to increased flood claims revenues and the onboarding of net new customers by our lender placed coverage program growth in these businesses was partially offset by certain programs that have been affected by lower rates and certain carriers changing their risk appetite for new or existing programs 

income before income taxes for 2016   increased   356  or 241 million  from the same period in 2015  to 918 million  the increase is the result of a lower intercompany interest charge of 100 million the receipt of certain premium tax refunds by our national flood program business along with revenue growth of 198 million 

the national programs segment’s total revenues in 2015   increased   61  or 245 million  over 2014  to a total of 4287 million  the 364 million   increase  in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following i an increase of approximately 385 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2014  ii 67 million related to net new business offset by iii a decrease of 88 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2014  from businesses since divested profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs were 156 million  in 2015  a decrease  of 53 million  from the same period of 2014  which was primarily driven by the loss experience of our carrier partners 

the national programs segment’s organic revenue growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 18  for 2015  this organic revenue growth rate was mainly due to the arrowhead personal property program which continued to produce more written premium the arrowhead automotive aftermarket program which received a commission rate increase from their carrier partner growth in our wright specialty education program and the onboarding of new customers by proctor financial growth in these businesses was partially offset by certain programs that have been affected by lower rates 

income before income taxes for 2015   decreased   75  or 55 million  from the same period in 2014  to 677 million  the decrease is the result of the 60 million gain on the sale of industry consulting group “icg” along with the 37 million sip grant forfeiture benefit associated with arrowhead which were both credits recorded in 2014 after adjusting for these onetime items in 2014 underlying income before income taxes increased and was driven by the net revenue growth noted above and expense management initiatives as we grow and scale our programs 

wholesale brokerage segment 

the wholesale brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance primarily through independent agents and brokers including brown  brown retail segment like the retail and national programs segments the wholesale brokerage segment’s revenues are primarily commissionbased

for further discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line term loan agreements and international operations 

our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable debt securities nonmarketable debt securities certificates of deposit us treasury securities and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds these investments are subject to interest rate risk the fair values of our invested assets at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date 

as of december 31 2016  we had 4813 million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan which bears interest on a floating basis tied to the london interbank offered rate libor and therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense the effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are subject to exchange rate risk primarily in our ukbased wholesale brokerage business that has a cost base principally denominated in british pounds and a revenue base in several other currencies but principally in us dollars based upon our foreign currency rate exposure as of december 31 2016 an immediate 10 hypothetical changes of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation the “evaluation” required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” as of december 31 2016  based upon the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our senior management including our ceo and cfo to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2016  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

employees 

at december 31 2015  the company had 7807 fulltime equivalent employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions 1 protecting our confidential information and trade secrets 2 restricting their ability postemployment to solicit the business of our customers and 3 preventing the hiring of our employees for a period of time after separation from 

employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon applicable law and factual circumstances the majority of our employment relationships are atwill and terminable by either party at any time however the covenants regarding confidential information and nonsolicitation of our customers and employees generally extend for a period of at least two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation terms and condition of coverage quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business while it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals purchasing insurance over the internet we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with singleline coverage which represent a small portion of our overall retail segment 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states and international jurisdictions are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular jurisdiction

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to and could be materially adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer our clients we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited 

our growth strategy partially depends on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 

given the current macroeconomic environment it is possible that us government actions in the form of a monetary stimulus a fiscal stimulus or both to the us economy could lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base resulting in an increase in our employee compensation and benefits and our other operating expenses this could harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase revenues or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation on our cost base 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida georgia illinois indiana kansas kentucky massachusetts michigan new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington adverse economic conditions natural disasters or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida georgia illinois indiana kansas kentucky massachusetts michigan new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we derived 14687 million or 884 13862 million or 880 and 11822 million or 867 of our revenues respectively from our operations located in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes particularly in florida where our headquarters and several offices are located earthquakes including california where we maintain a number of offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2015  no insurance company accounted for more than 73 of our total core commissions for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  approximately 70 and 80 respectively of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should this insurance company seek to terminate its arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business and we could likely move our business to one of these other insurance companies although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result 

our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies technology companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediary services 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year these commissions generally have been in the range of 30 to 50 of our previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations profitability and our financial condition 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current customers merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the overall amount of work that we perform for these customers if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that customer or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us likewise larger companies may establish internal risk management functions lessening the services they seek from us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

we maintain cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities as disclosed in prior years certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the company has not chosen to discontinue receiving profitsharing contingent commissions or override commissions the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while we cannot predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations further if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions it would likely adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in all states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our clients carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and new york as well as certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules regulations or interpretations thereof will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

changes in laws and regulations may increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended “sarbanesoxley” and the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 have required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of these acts the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated and will likely continue to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects these developments have increased and may increase in the future our compliance costs may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

from time to time new regulations are enacted or existing requirements are changed and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the 2010 affordable care act and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

healthcare reform and increased costs of current employees’ medical and other benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our profitability is affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of economic factors beyond our control although we have actively sought to contain increases in these costs there can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

in addition we believe that increased healthcare costs resulting from the 2010 affordable care act could have a material adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to litigation which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are and may be subject to a number of claims regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome of these claims actions and proceedings with certainty 

an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years where appropriate we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

  while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by further changes in the usbased credit markets 

although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2019 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the credit agreements that govern our debt contain various covenants and other limitations with which we must comply at december 31 2015  we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of these agreements however failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition in the event of certain defaults the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable if the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities in particular among other covenants our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain transactionrelated items “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

our credit ratings are subject to change 

our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our securities agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing agency each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating 

we have operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

we have operations in the united kingdom bermuda and the cayman islands in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

   

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key personnel are prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a period of years following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2015  fiscal year we have 25867 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2015  and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see note 1“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising brown  brown is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year we assess the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset 

group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

current us economic conditions and the shift away from traditional insurance markets may continue to adversely affect our business 

if economic conditions were to worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in values of insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency of insurance companies or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers also if general economic conditions are poor some of our clients may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these clients are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties which could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the annual consolidated financial statements and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

rapid technological change in our industry may require additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies may require us to make additional investments in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions or impacts to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report information to carriers an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs while we have taken and continue to take actions to protect the security and privacy of our information entirely eliminating all risk of improper access to private information is not possible 

we are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2015  our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 173 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his son j powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 162 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

  

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in future yearends as required by section 404 of sarbanesoxley investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of our shares 

as directed by section 404 of sarbanesoxley the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal controls over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements however if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments 

relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition please see “information regarding nongaap measures” below regarding important information on nongaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including loss experience risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2015 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues dropped 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 17 billion in 2015 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 139 in the same 22year period we increased net income from 81 million to 2433 million in 2015 a compound annual growth rate of 167 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units changes in premium rate levels and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we foster a strong decentralized sales and service culture with the goal of consistent sustained growth over the longterm 

the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period “core organic commissions and fees” a nongaap measure are reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 40 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income in the year received 

certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” in lieu of profitsharing contingent commissions since gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written for the twelvemonth period ending december 31 2015  we had earned 100 million of gscs of which 76 million remained accrued at december 31 2015 as most of this will be collected in the first quarter of 2016 for the twelve month periods ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we earned 100 million 99 million and 83 million respectively from gscs 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by 1 our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies and to a lesser extent 3 our retail segment in our largeaccount customer base these services are provided over a period of time typically one year fee revenues on a consolidated basis as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 306 in 2015  306 in 2014  and 266 in 2013  

additionally our profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs for the year ended december 31 2015   decreased  by 58 million  over 2014  primarily as a result of increased loss ratios in our national programs and wholesale brokerage segment other income decreased  by 50 million  primarily as a result of a reduction in the gains on the sale of books of business when compared to 2014  and the change in where this activity is presented in the financial statements as described in the results of operations section below 

for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  our consolidated internal revenue growth rate was 26  and 20  respectively additionally each of our four segments recorded positive internal revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2015  in the event that the gradual increases in insurable exposure units that occurred in the past few years continues through 2016 and premium rate changes are similar with 2015 we believe we will continue to see positive quarterly internal revenue growth rates in 2016 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous income 

income before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015   increased  over 2014  by 628 million  primarily as a result of acquisitions completed in the past twelve months and net new business partially offset by the incremental interest expense associated with our inaugural public debt offering completed in 2014 along with incremental investments in revenue producing teammates 

information regarding nongaap measures 

in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we provide information regarding core commissions and fees core organic commissions and fees and our internal growth rate which is the growth rate of our core organic commissions and fees and adjusted calculations of core commissions and fees core organic commissions and fees and our internal growth rate after adjusting for the significant revenue recorded at our colonial claims operation in the first half of 2013 attributable to superstorm sandy these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to including any adjusted internal growth rate the gaap information provided in this annual report on form 10k tabular reconciliations of this supplemental nongaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10k we present such nongaap supplemental financial information as we believe such information provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis this supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to not in lieu of our consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions 

part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through the fourth  quarter of 2015  we acquired 472  insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities of which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition business combinations and purchase price allocations intangible asset impairments and reserves for litigation in particular the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment to be made by management different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations refer to note 1 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is processed into our systems whichever is later commission revenues related to installment billings are recognized on the later of the date effective or invoiced with the exception of our arrowhead business which follows a policy of recognizing on the later of the date effective or processed into our systems regardless of the billing arrangement management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification from insurance companies concerning matters necessitating such adjustments profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is generally when such commissions are received from insurance companies or periodically when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues and commissions for employee benefits coverages and workers’ compensation programs are recognized as services are rendered 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from 5 to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

acquisition purchase prices are typically based on a multiple of average annual operating profit earned over a oneto threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” or on a discounted cash flow basis 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable any of the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii a significant negative industry or economic trends and iii a significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2015 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options and nonvested stock awards to our employees and the related compensation expense is required to be recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

during the first quarter of 2016 the performance conditions for approximately 14 million shares of the company’s common stock granted under the company’s stock incentive plan are expected to be determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performancebased grants issued in 2011 these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31 2015 the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2011 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable the shares are expected to be awarded during the first quarter of 2016 pursuant to review and certification of the performance measurements against the stated grant targets by the compensation committee in accordance with the stock incentive plan as a result of the awarding of these shares the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted eps 

litigation claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income 

results of operations for the years ended december 31   2015  2014  and 2013

investment income increased  to 10 million  in 2015  compared with 07 million  in 2014  due to additional interest income driven by cash management activities to earn a higher yield investment income increased  to 07 million  in 2014  compared with 06 million  in 2013  mainly due to higher average daily invested balances in 2014 than in 2013 

other income net 

other income for 2015  reflected income of 26 million  compared with 76 million  in 2014  and 71 million  in 2013  other income in 2015 consisted primarily of legal settlements and also gains and loss on the sale and disposition of fixed assets in 2014 and 2013 other income included legal settlements and gains and loss on the sale and disposition of fixed assets as well as gains and losses from the sale on books of business customer accounts prior to the adoption of asu no 201408 “reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity” “asu 201408” in the fourth quarter of 2014 net gains and losses on the sale of businesses or customer accounts were reflected in other income any such gains or losses are now reflected on a net basis in the expense section since the adoption of asu 201408 the 50 million  change in 2015  other income from the comparable period in 2014  was primarily due to prior year book of business sales and to a lesser extent the change to the presentation of this activity in the financial statements we recognized gains of 06 million  53 million and 31 million from sales on books of business customer accounts in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased   63  or 497 million  in 2015  over 2014  this increase included 258 million  of compensation costs related to standalone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2014  therefore employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2015  and 2014  increased by 239 million  or 32 this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to i an increase in producer and staff salaries as we made targeted investments in our business ii increased profit center bonuses and commissions due to increased revenue and operating profit and iii the increased cost of health insurance employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 507  for 2015 as compared to 502  for the year ended december 31 2014  

employee compensation and benefits expense increased approximately 159  or 1087 million  in 2014  over 2013 however that net increase included 810 million of compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2014  and 2013  increased by 277 million the employee compensation and benefit increases from these offices were primarily related to increases in staff and management salaries of 138 million new salaried producers of 48 million profit center and other related bonuses of 67 million compensation to our commissioned producers of 09 million and health insurance costs of 48 million these increases were partially offset by net reductions in temporary employees employer 401k plan matching contributions and accrued vacation expense employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 502  as compared to 501  for the year ended december 31 2013  this slight increase was driven by continued investment in new teammates 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company has an employee stock purchase plan grants nonvested stock awards and to a lesser extent grants stock options under other equitybased plans to its employees compensation expense for all sharebased awards is recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards for 2015  2014  and 2013  the noncash stockbased compensation expense incorporated the costs related to each of the company’s four stockbased plans as explained in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

noncash stockbased compensation expense decreased   39 million  or 199  in 2015  over 2014  the decrease was the result of i older grants attaining the vesting requirements and therefore being fully expensed in prior periods ii some forfeitures driven by certain grants not achieving all vesting requirements and iii underlying participation levels all of which were partially offset by the additional expense attributable to the new grants issued in 2015 

noncash stockbased compensation expense decreased   32 million  or 143  in 2014  over 2013  primarily as a result of forfeitures due to the nonachievement of certain performance criteria partially offset by an increase associated with new nonvested stock awards granted on july 1 2013 under our stock incentive plan “sip” 

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 151  in 2015  149  in 2014  and 144  in 2013  other operating expenses in 2015   increased   157 million  or 67  over 2014  of which 126 million  was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2014  the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2015  and 2014  increased by 31 million  or 13 which was primarily attributable to increased sales meetings legal and consulting expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with office rent telecommunications and bank fees 

other operating expenses in 2014   increased   397 million  or 203  over 2013  of which 390 million  was related to acquisitions therefore other operating expenses attributable to offices that existed in the same periods in both 2014  and 2013  including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 07 million  the 07 million  net increase includes increases of 20 million related to increased data processing and software licensing expense 12 million related to increased inspection and consulting fees 08 million related to office rent and 09 million related to increased employee sales meeting costs offset by decreases of 30 million for legal claims and litigation expenses 10 million for insurance expenses and 02 million in other various expense decreases 

gain or loss on disposal 

the company recognized a gain on disposal of 06 million  in 2015  and a loss on disposal of 474 million  in 2014  the pretax loss for 2014 is the result of the disposal of the axiom re business as part of the company’s strategy to exit the reinsurance brokerage business prior to the adoption of asu 201408 in the fourth quarter of 2014 as noted above net gains and losses on the sale of businesses or customer accounts were reflected in other income although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or because doing so is in the company’s best interest we recognized gains of 06 million  53 million and 31 million from sales on books of business customer accounts in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

amortization 

amortization expense increased   45 million  or 55  in 2015  and increased   150 million  or 221  in 2014  the increases were due primarily to the amortization of additional intangible assets as the result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation expense remained flat in 2015  and increased   34 million  or 195  in 2014  the increase in 2014 was due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from acquisitions completed since 2013 while the stable level of expense in 2015 versus 2014 reflected capital additions approximately equal to the value of prior additions that became fully depreciated 

interest expense 

interest expense increased   108 million  or 382  in 2015  and 120 million  or 728  in 2014  these increases were primarily due to the increased debt borrowings and an increase in our effective rate of interest for the years ended  2015 and 2014 the increased debt borrowings from the prior year include the credit facility term loan entered into in may 2014 in the initial amount of 5500 million at libor plus 1375 basis points and the 5000 million senior notes due 2024 issued during september 2014 at a fixed rate of interest of 42 the credit facility term loan proceeds replaced preexisting debt of 2300 million with similar rates of interest the proceeds from the senior notes due 2024 were used to settle the credit facility revolver debt of 3750 million which had a lower but variable rate of interest based on an adjusted libor this transitioned the debt to a favorable longterm fixed rate of interest and extended the date of maturity of those funds these changes were the result of an evolution and maturation of our previous debt structure and provide increased debt capacity and flexibility 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair value of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase price arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2015  the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 as defined in asc 820fair value measurement the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 



for the years ended   december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  the fair value of estimated earnout payables was reevaluated and increased by 30 million 74 million and 06 million respectively which resulted in charges to the consolidated statement of income 

as of december 31 2015  the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 784 million  of which 253 million  was recorded as accounts payable and 531 million  was recorded as other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2014 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 753 million  of which 260 million was recorded as accounts payable and 493 million was recorded as other noncurrent liability 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 396  in 2015  391  in 2014  and 393  in 2013  the increased effective tax rate was largely the result of more income in states with a higher average effective state income tax rate which was primarily new york state 

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services on a segmented basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses generally result from completed acquisitions within a given segment in a particular year likewise other income in each segment reflects net gains primarily from legal settlements and miscellaneous income as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment management emphasizes the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

segment results for prior periods have been recast to reflect the current year segmental structure certain reclassifications have been made to the prioryear amounts reported in this annual report on form 10k in order to conform to the current year presentation

retail segment 

the retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 870  of the retail segment’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses are not correlated to changes in commissions on insurance premiums a significant portion of any fluctuation in the commissions we receive net of related producer compensation will result in a similar fluctuation in our income before income taxes unless we make incremental investments in the organization 

financial information relating to our retail segment is as follows 





nmf  not a meaningful figure 

the retail segment’s total revenues in 2015   increased   57  or 467 million  over the same period in 2014  to 8703 million  the 436 million   increase  in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following i approximately 356 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2014  ii 110 million related to net new business and iii an offsetting decrease of 30 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in 2014  and 2015  profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2015   increased   34  or 10 million  over 2014  to 303 million  the retail segment’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 14  for 2015  and was driven by revenue from net new business written during the preceding twelve months along with modest increases in commercial auto rates and partially offset by i terminated association health plans in the state of washington ii continued pressure on the small employee benefits business as some accounts adopt alternative plan designs and move to a per employeeper month payment model due to the implementation of the affordable care act and iii reductions in property insurance premium rates specifically in catastropheprone areas 

income before income taxes for 2015  increased   155  or 244 million  over the same period in 2014  to 1819 million  the primary factors affecting this increase were i the net increase in revenue as described above ii a 71 or 294 million increase in employee compensation and benefits due primarily to the year on year impact of new teammates related to acquisitions completed in the past twelve months in addition to incremental investments in revenue producing teammates iii operating expenses which increased  by 38 million  or 29  due to increased travel and value added consulting services offset by iv a reduction in the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables of 55 million or 731 to 20 million and v a 42 million or 257 reduction in noncash stockbased compensation to 121 million due to the forfeiture of certain grants where performance conditions were not fully achieved 

the retail segment’s total revenues in 2014  increased   117  or 863 million  over the same period in 2013  to 8237 million  profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2014   increased   203  or 50 million  over 2013  to 293 million  primarily due to improved loss ratios resulting in increased profitability for insurance companies in 2013  the 861 million   increase  in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following i approximately 773 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2013 ii 143 million related to net new business and iii an offsetting decrease of 55 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded from business divested in the last year the retail segment’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 20  for 2014  and was driven by net new customers increasing insurable exposure units in certain areas of the united states and was partially offset by continued pressure on property and casualty rates especially in coastal areas 

income before income taxes for 2014  decreased   27  or 43 million  over the same period in 2013  to 1575 million  this decrease was primarily due to a higher interest charge of 88 million  corresponding to capital utilized for acquisitions in 2014  and 89 million  related to the yearonyear changes in the estimated earnout payable the underlying increase was driven by net new business acquired business and increased profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs noncash stockbased compensation increased 60 million  or 585  for 2014  over the same period in 2013  as the cost of grants to employees for the purpose of driving performance were realized 

national programs segment

national programs total revenues in 2015  increased   61  or 245 million  over 2014  to a total 4287 million  the 364 million   increase  in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following i an increase of approximately 385 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2014  ii 67 million related to net new business offset by iii a decrease of 88 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2014  from businesses since divested profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs were 156 million  in 2015  which was a decrease  of 53 million  over 2014  which was primarily driven by the loss experience of our carrier partners 

the national programs segment’s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 18  for 2015  this internal growth rate was mainly due to the arrowhead personal property program which continued to produce more written premium the arrowhead automotive aftermarket program which received a commission rate increase from their carrier partner growth in our wright specialty education program and the onboarding of new clients by proctor financial growth in these businesses was partially offset by certain programs that have been affected by lower rates 

income before income taxes for 2015  decreased   75  or 55 million  from the same period in 2014  to 677 million  the decrease is the result of the 60 million gain on the sale of industry consulting group “icg” along with the 37 million sip grant forfeiture benefit 

associated with arrowhead which were both credits recorded in 2014 after adjusting for these onetime items in 2014 underlying income before income taxes increased and was driven by the net revenue growth noted above and expense management initiatives as we grow and scale our programs 

the national programs segment’s total revenues in 2014  increased   341  or 1029 million  over 2013  to a total of 4042 million  the 958 million   increase  in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following i approximately 938 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from the wright and beecher carlson acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2013  ii 56 million related to net new business and iii an offsetting decrease of 36 million in books of business that were disposed or transferred to other segments profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs were 208 million  in 2014  which was an increase  of 13 million  from the same period of 2013  this increase was due primarily to a 05 million increase in profitsharing contingent commissions received by florida intracoastal underwriters limited company and a 08 million increase in profitsharing contingent commissions received by proctor financial inc other income increased by approximately 57 million  primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of industry consulting group inc “icg” of 60 million 

income before income taxes for 2014  increased   195  or 120 million  from the same period in 2013  to 732 million  the increase in income before taxes was due to net new business growth noted above revenues and operating profits derived from wright the gain on the sale of icg and a noncash stockbased compensation decrease  of 37 million  primarily related to partial sip grant forfeitures associated with arrowhead the 120 million  increase was partially offset by an increase in the intercompany interest expense charge related to wright

income before income taxes for 2015   increased   564 million  over 2014  to 647 million  primarily due to the following i the 474 million net pretax loss on disposal of the axiom re business in 2014 ii the net increase in revenue as described above and iii the impact of the axiom re business divested in 2014 that reported lower margins than the wholesale brokerage segment’s average

our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable debt securities nonmarketable debt securities certificates of deposit us treasury securities and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds these investments are subject to interest rate risk the fair values of our invested assets at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date 

as of december 31 2015 we had 5294 million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan which bears interest on a floating basis tied to the london interbank offered rate libor and therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense the effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are subject to exchange rate risk primarily in our uk based wholesale brokerage business that has a cost base principally denominated in british pounds and a revenue base in several other currencies but principally in us dollars based on our foreign currency rate exposure as of december 31 2015 an immediate 10 hypothetical changes of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation the “evaluation” required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” as of december 31 2015  based on the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our senior management including our ceo and cfo to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2015  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business tableend general 

brown  brown is a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and service organization with origins dating from 1939 headquartered in daytona beach florida we market and sell to our customers insurance products and services primarily in the property casualty and employee benefits areas as an agent and broker we do not assume underwriting risks with the exception of the activity in wright which was acquired in may 2014 we provide our customers with quality noninvestment insurance contracts as well as other targeted customized risk management products and services within wright we operate a writeyourown flood insurance carrier wright national flood insurance company “wnfic” which is a wright subsidiary wnfic’s entire business consists of policies written pursuant to the national flood insurance program “nfip” the program administered by the federal emergency management agency “fema” and excess flood insurance policies which are fully reinsured substantially eliminating wnfic’s exposure to underwriting risk given that these policies are backed by either fema or a reinsurance carrier with an am best company rating of “a” or better 

the company is compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent by fees paid directly by customers for certain services commission revenues are usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases we share commissions with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “profitsharing contingent commission” which is a profitsharing commission based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and catastrophe claims adjusting services 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers and 3 our retail segment for fees received in lieu of commissions primarily since our july 1 2013 acquisition of beecher carlson holdings inc “beecher carlson” which services many larger feebased accounts the amount of our revenues from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

as of december 31 2014 our activities were conducted in 232 locations in 41 states as follows as well as in london england hamilton bermuda and george town cayman islands 

 

  

industry overview 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting riskbearing industry has historically been cyclical in nature and has varied widely based on market conditions for example in late 2003 after three years of a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing the insurance industry experienced the return of a “soft” market characterized by flat or reduced premium rates in many lines and geographic areas in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the southeastern united states experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida and the following year brought that region the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by insurance companies due to these hurricanes property and casualty insurance premium rates increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern united states in 2006 while otherwise generally declining during 2006 and 2007 

to counter the higher property insurance rates in florida the state of florida directed its property “insurer of last resort” “citizens property insurance corporation” “citizens” to significantly reduce its rates beginning in january 2007 and extending through january 1 2010 as a result several of our floridabased operations lost significant amounts of revenue to citizens in this period since that time citizens’ impact on our operations has declined each year as citizens has slowly increased its rates in an effort to reduce its insured exposures our commission revenues from citizens for 2014 2013 and 2012 were approximately 38 million 57 million and 64 million respectively 

although property and casualty insurance premium rates generally continued to decline from 2008 through 2011 in most lines of coverage the rates of decline were slowing however from the second half of 2008 through 2011 insurable exposure units such as sales and payroll expenditures decreased significantly primarily in the southeastern and western regions of the united states due to the economic recession and this decrease had a greater adverse impact on our commissions and fees revenue than did declining insurance premium rates in this period 

from the first quarter of 2012 through 2013 insurance premium rates gradually increased for most lines of coverage and insurable exposure units began to flatten and in certain cases increase as a result in 2012 the company achieved positive internal organic core commissions and fees revenue growth for the first time since 2006 in 2013 these rate and exposure unit increases along with new business growth generated positive internal organic revenue growth for each of our four reportable business segments in each quarter with the single exception of the fourth quarter for our services segment which experienced a record fourth quarter in 2012 as a result of the significant flood claims activity from superstorm sandy that was not replicated in 2013 

during 2014 changes in rates and exposure units varied by geography and line of business with rates and units for employee benefits increasing as a result of general improvements in the economy we have experienced a downward trend in coverage for employers with less than 50 employees due to the implementation of the affordable care act that has driven more employees to state healthcare exchanges rates for property and casualty coverage were under pressure especially in the coastal areas as a long period without significant storm activity and low interest rates have driven significant loss reserves and alternative capital sources 

segment information 

our business is divided into four reportable segments 1 the retail segment 2 the national programs segment 3 the wholesale brokerage segment and 4 the services segment the retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic entities and to professional and individual customers the national programs segment provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and also through our brown  brown retail offices markets targeted products and services designed for specific industries trade groups public and quasipublic entities and market niches and provides flood coverage the wholesale brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance primarily through independent agents and brokers the services segment provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and catastrophe claims adjusting services

none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct sales efforts have had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail segment is mostly commercially oriented rather than individually oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer our clients we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited 

 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 

given the current macroeconomic environment it is possible that us government actions in the form of a monetary stimulus a fiscal stimulus or both to the us economy could lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base resulting in an increase in our employee compensation and benefits and our other operating expenses this could harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase revenues or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation on our cost base 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida georgia illinois indiana kansas massachusetts michigan new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington adverse economic conditions natural disasters or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida georgia illinois indiana kansas massachusetts michigan new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we derived 13615 million or 864 11638 million or 854 and 10165 million or 848 of our revenues respectively from our operations located in these states we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to customers in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes particularly in florida where our headquarters are located and we maintain several offices earthquakes including california where we maintain a relatively large number of offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2014 no insurance company accounted for more than 70 of our total core commissions for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 80 and 50 respectively of our total core commissions were derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should this insurance company seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business and we could likely move our business to one of these other insurance companies although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result 

 

our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediary services 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year these commissions generally have accounted for 43 to 44 of our previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current customers merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the overall amount of work that we perform for these customers if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that customer or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

we maintain cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities as disclosed in prior years certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the company has not chosen to discontinue receiving profitsharing contingent commissions or override commissions the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while we cannot predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations further if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions it would likely adversely affect our results of operations 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our clients carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

 

changes in laws and regulations may increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended “sarbanesoxley” and the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 have required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of these acts the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated and will likely continue to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects these developments have increased and may increase in the future our compliance costs may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

from time to time new regulations are enacted or existing requirements are changed and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the 2010 health care reform legislation and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

healthcare reform and increased costs of current employees’ medical and other benefits could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

our profitability is affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of economic factors beyond our control although we have actively sought to contain increases in these costs there can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

in addition we believe that increased health care costs resulting from the 2010 health care reform bill could have a material adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to litigation which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are and may be subject to a number of claims regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome of these claims actions and proceedings with certainty an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by further changes in the usbased credit markets 

although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2019 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in certain of our agreements our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

the credit agreements that govern our debt contain various covenants and other limitations with which we must comply at december 31 2014 we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of these agreements however failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition in the event of certain defaults the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable if the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness including the notes were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

certain of our agreements contain various covenants that limit the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities in particular among other covenants the credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain transactionrelated items “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated ebitda our compliance with these covenants limits our management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities 

our credit ratings are subject to change 

our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our securities agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing agency each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

 

we have operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

we have operations in the united kingdom hamilton bermuda and george town cayman islands in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key personnel are prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a period of years following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2014 fiscal year we have 2460610929 of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2014 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see note 1—“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3—“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising brown  brown is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year brown  brown assesses the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

current us economic conditions and the shift away from traditional insurance markets may continue to adversely affect our business 

from late 2007 through 2011 global consumer confidence had eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values volatility in energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit high unemployment and the stability and solvency of financial institutions financial markets businesses and sovereign nations those concerns slowed economic growth and resulted in a recession in the united states economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations during the years 2008 through 2011 due to reduced customer demand in 2012 the economic conditions in the middlemarket economy appeared to stabilize and a gradual improvement continued through 2013 and 2014 however if these economic conditions worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in values of insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers also if general economic conditions are poor some of our clients may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these clients are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties which could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of profitability as traditional insurance markets 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that may be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

 

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report results to carriers an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs while we have taken and continue to take actions to protect the security and privacy of our information entirely eliminating all risk of improper access to private information is not possible 

we are taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2014 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 178 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his family members which include his sons j powell brown our president and chief executive officer and p barrett brown one of our senior vice presidents beneficially owned approximately 160 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 and future yearends as required by section 404 of sarbanesoxley investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of our shares 

as directed by section 404 of sarbanesoxley the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements however if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 

we foster a strong decentralized sales culture with a goal of consistent sustained growth over the long term 

we increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2014 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues dropped 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 16 billion in 2014 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 142 in the same 21 year period we increased net income from 81 million to 2069 million in 2014 a compound annual growth rate of 167 

the years 2007 through 2011 posed significant challenges for us and for our industry in the form of a prevailing decline in insurance premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” and increased significant governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace which resulted in a substantial loss of revenues for us additionally beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2011 there was a general decline in insurable exposure units as the consequence of the general weakening of the economy in the united states as a result from the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 we experienced negative internal revenue growth each quarter the continued declining exposure units during 2010 and 2011 had a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than declining insurance premium rates 

beginning in the first quarter of 2012 many insurance premium rates began to slightly increase additionally in the second quarter of 2012 the general declines in insurable exposure units started to flatten and these exposures units subsequently began to gradually increase during the year as a result we recorded positive internal revenue growth for each quarter of 2012 for each of our four segments with two exceptions the first quarter for the retail segment and the third quarter for the national programs segment in which declines of only 07 and 33 respectively were experienced 

this growth trend has continued into 2014 with our consolidated internal revenue growth rate of 20 additionally each of our four segments recorded positive internal revenue growth for each quarter in 2014 except for the services segment in the first quarter the decline in the core organic commissions and fees revenues in the first quarter of 2014 for the services segment was the result of the significant revenue recorded at our colonial claims operation in the first quarter of 2013 attributable to superstorm sandy for which no comparable revenues occurred in the first quarter of 2014 in the first quarter of 2013 colonial claims earned claims fees of 162 million as a direct result of the continued significant claims activity from superstorm sandy 

 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 43 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in contrast the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period “core organic commissions and fees” are reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates 

certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” in lieu of profit –sharing contingent commissions since gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written as of december 31 2014 we had 76 million of gsc revenue accrued and had earned 99 million of gscs during 2014 most of which will be collected in the first quarter of 2015 for the twelvemonth periods ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we earned gscs of 99 million 83 million and 91 million respectively 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by 1 our services segment which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and catastrophe claims adjusting services and 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies these services are provided over a period of time typically one year however in conjunction with our july 1 2013 acquisition of beecher carlson which has a primary focus on large retail customers that generally pay us fees directly the fee revenues in our retail segment for 2014 have increased by 448 million to 1178 million also with the acquisition of wright which primarily receives income in the form of fees fee revenue in our national programs segment increased 819 million to 1528 million fee revenues on a consolidated basis as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 306 in 2014 266 in 2013 and 217 in 2012 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities as a result of the bank liquidity and solvency issues in the united states in the last quarter of 2008 we moved substantial amounts of our cash into noninterest bearing checking accounts so that they would be fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” or into moneymarket investment funds a portion of which is fdic insured of suntrust and wells fargo two large national banks effective january 1 2013 the fdic ceased providing insurance guarantees on noninterest bearing checking accounts and since that time we have invested in both interest bearing and noninterest bearing checking accounts investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets but will also include subrental income legal settlements and other miscellaneous income

current year company overview 

2014 was a strong year for revenue growth and continued the positive trends that began in 2012 after the fiveyear period extending from 2007 to 2011 in which we experienced negative internal growth in our core organic commissions and fees revenue which we believe was a direct result of the general weakness of the economy we achieved a positive internal revenue growth of 67 in 2013 and 20 in 2014 

the net growth in core organic commissions and fees in 2014 of 256 million is significantly less than the comparable growth in 2013 of 756 million similar to the core organic commissions and fees in 2012 of 249 million and significantly better than the net lost revenues of 215 million in 2011 however it should be noted that of the 756 million growth in the 2013 core organic commissions and fees 381 million was generated by two new programs at our arrowhead operation the automobile aftermarket program and the nonstandard auto program and from our colonial claims operation as a result of the significant claims activity attributable to superstorm sandy the growth in the core organic commissions and fees revenue for 2014 is principally attributable to new business and increasing insurance exposure units as a result of a gradually improving us economy 

income before income taxes in 2014 decreased over 2013 by 50 or 179 million to 3397 million however that net decrease includes a 474 million pretax loss on disposal of certain assets of axiom re lp “axiom re” this office sale was effective december 31 2014 and represents part of our strategic plan to exit the reinsurance business the loss associated with this sale resulted in a 021 reduction to earnings per share income before income taxes related to new acquisitions was 375 million and therefore income before income taxes from offices that existed in the same time periods of 2014 and 2013 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 554 million the net decrease of 554 million related primarily to net new business offset by the 474 million loss on the sale of axiom re along with the decrease in revenue associated with claims from superstorm sandy received in 2013 with no comparable revenues in 2014 277 million of higher compensation and benefits costs increased interest costs of 120 million relating to additional debt used to fund acquisition activity in 2014 and 75 million from the change in estimated earnout payables 

acquisitions 

approximately 37500 independent insurance agencies are estimated to be operating currently in the united states part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through 2014 we acquired 459 insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts 

we continue to acquire insurance operations that we believe are strategic in growing our business segments in each of the last two years we completed ten acquisitions in 2014 with estimated revenues of 1595 million and nine acquisitions in 2013 with estimated revenues of 1428 million 

a summary of our acquisitions over the last three years is as follows in millions except for number of acquisitions 

 

 on may 1 2014 we completed the acquisition of wright which was previously announced january 15 2014 wright has estimated annualized revenues of 1200 million the total cash paid for wright was 6092 million wright’s operations include a national flood insurance program governmentsponsored insurance programs and proprietary national and regional programs 

on july 1 2013 we completed the acquisition of beecher carlson an insurance and risk management broker with operations that include retail brokerage program management and captive management the aggregate purchase price for beecher carlson was 4693 million including 3643 million of cash payments and the assumption of 1050 million of liabilities beecher carlson was acquired primarily to expand brown  brown’s retail and national programs businesses and to attract and hire highquality individuals 

 

on january 9 2012 we completed the acquisition of arrowhead general insurance agency superholding corporation “arrowhead” pursuant to a merger agreement dated december 15 2011 the “merger agreement” under the merger agreement the total cash purchase price of 3950 million was subject to adjustments for options to purchase shares of arrowhead’s common stock working capital sharing of net operating tax losses arrowhead’s preferred stock units transaction expenses and closing debt in addition within 60 days following the third anniversary of the acquisition’s closing date we will pay to certain persons who were arrowhead equityholders as of the closing date additional earnout payments equal collectively to 50 million subject to certain adjustments based on the “cumulative ebitda” of arrowhead and all of its subsidiaries as calculated pursuant to the merger agreement during the final year of the threeyear period following the acquisition’s closing date 

arrowhead is a national insurance program manager and one of the largest managing general agents “mgas” in the property and casualty insurance industry 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition business combinations and purchase price allocations intangible asset impairments and reserves for litigation in particular the accounting for these areas requires significant judgments to be made by management different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations refer to note 1 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is processed into our systems whichever is later commission revenues related to installment billings are recognized on the later of the date effective or invoiced with the exception of our arrowhead business which follows a policy of recognizing on the later of the date effective or processed into our systems regardless of the billing arrangement management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification from insurance companies concerning matters necessitating such adjustments profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received from insurance companies or when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues and commissions for workers’ compensation programs are recognized as services are rendered 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

 

acquisition purchase prices are typically based on a multiple of average annual operating profit earned over a oneto threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” or on a discounted cash flow basis 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and assesses the recoverability of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2014 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options and nonvested stock awards to our employees and the related compensation expense is required to be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

litigation claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201408 “reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity” “asu 201408” which changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhances disclosures in this area under the new guidance the disposal of a component or group of components of an entity should be reported as a discontinued operation if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results disposals of equity method investments or those reported as heldforsale must be presented as a discontinued operation if they meet the new definition the standard is effective prospectively for all disposals of components or classification of components as heldforsale of an entity that occur within interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2014 early adoption is permitted but only for disposals or classifications of components as heldforsale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued brown  brown has elected to early adopt this pronouncement and has reported the disposal of the axiom re business in accordance with this pronouncement 

in may 2014 fasb issued asu no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu 201409” which provides guidance for revenue recognition asu 201409 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605 “revenue recognition” and most industryspecific guidance the standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in doing so companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today’s guidance these may include identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation asu 201409 is effective for the company beginning january 1 2017 and at that time the company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach early adoption is not permitted the company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of asu 201409 will have on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in august 2014 fasb issued asu 201415 “disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” “asu 201415” which addresses management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures asu 201415 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 and for interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the company does not expect to early adopt this guidance and it believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

with the wright acquisition we now have insurance company operations for which we have adopted accounting policies that were consistent with the accounting policies in place at wright prior to their acquisition by brown  brown these are detailed in note 1 to the financial statements under “summary of significant accounting policies”

investment income 

investment income increased to 07 million in 2014 compared with 06 million in 2013 mainly due to higher average daily invested balances in 2014 than in 2013 investment income of 06 million in 2013 was down 02 million as compared to 2012 mainly due to lower average daily invested balances in 2013 than in 2012 

other income net 

other income for 2014 reflected income of 76 million compared with 71 million in 2013 and 102 million in 2012 we recognized gains of 53 million 31 million and 43 million from sales on books of business customer accounts in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively although we are not in the business of selling books of business we periodically will sell an office or a book of business because it does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or for other reasons related to the particular assets in question other income also included 16 million and 36 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively paid to us in connection with settlements of litigation against former employees for violations of restrictive covenants contained in their employment agreements with us for 2014 other income from legal settlement was negligible additionally we recognized nonrecurring gains rental income and sales of software services of 09 million 24 million and 23 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased approximately 159 or 1087 million in 2014 however that net increase included 810 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2014 and 2013 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 277 million the employee compensation and benefit increases from these offices were primarily related to increases in staff and management salaries of 138 million new salaried producers of 48 million profit center and other related bonuses of 67 million compensation to our commissioned producers of 09 million and health insurance costs of 48 million these increases were partially offset by net reductions in temporary employees employer 401k plan matching contributions and accrued vacation expense employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 502 as compared to 501 for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 this slight increase is driven by continued investment in new teammates 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased approximately 122 or 745 million in 2013 however that net increase included 376 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2013 and 2012 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 369 million the employee compensation and benefit increases from these offices were primarily related to increases in staff and management salaries of 166 million new salaried producers of 47 million profit center and other related bonuses of 34 million compensation to our commissioned producers of 57 million health insurance costs of 18 million payrollrelated taxes of 37 million and other net expenses of 10 million

noncash stockbased compensation decreased 143 or 32 million in 2014 over 2013 primarily as a result of forfeitures due to the nonachievement of certain performance criteria partially offset by an increase associated with new nonvested stock awards granted on july 1 2013 under our stock incentive plan “sip” 

noncash stockbased compensation increased 425 or 67 million in 2013 over 2012 primarily as a result of new nonvested stock awards granted on july 1 2013 under our sip most of these sip grants will typically vest in four to seven years subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria by grantees and the achievement of consolidated earnings per share growth at certain levels by us over threeto fiveyear measurement periods some sip grants will vest after five years of service 

 

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 149 in 2014 144 in 2013 and 145 in 2012 

other operating expenses in 2014 increased 397 million over 2013 of which 390 million was related to acquisitions therefore other operating expenses attributable to offices that existed in the same periods in both 2014 and 2013 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 07 million of the 07 million increase 20 million related to increased data processing and software licensing expense 12 million related to increased inspection and consulting fees 08 million related to office rent and 09 million related to increased employee sales meeting costs these increased costs were partially offset by decreases of 30 million for legal claims and litigation expenses 10 million for insurance expenses and 02 million in other various net cost decreases 

other operating expenses in 2013 increased 213 million over 2012 of which 125 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses attributable to offices that existed in the same periods in both 2013 and 2012 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 88 million of the 88 million increase 20 million related to increased data processing and software licensing expense 20 million related to increased inspection and consulting fees 16 million related to increased accounting and advisory fees 09 million related to increased employee sales meeting costs and 29 million related to other various net cost increases these increased costs were partially offset by a decrease of 06 million for legal claims and litigation expenses 

loss on disposal 

during 2014 the company recognized a loss on disposal of 474 million as a result of the sale of axiom re axiom effective december 31 2014 the sale is part of the company’s strategy to exit the reinsurance brokerage business for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 axiom recorded a loss income before income taxes of 587000 and 113000 respectively which are included in the wholesale brokerage segment the transaction was recorded in accordance to asu 201408 the company’s prior nonsignificant disposals are recorded in the other income net in the consolidated statements of income 

amortization 

amortization expense increased 150 million or 221 in 2014 and 44 million or 69 in 2013 the increases in 2014 and 2013 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation increased 195 to 209 million in 2014 and 137 to 175 million in 2013 the increases in 2014 and 2013 were due primarily to the addition of fixed assets as a result of recent acquisitions 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 120 million or 728 in 2014 and 03 million or 21 in 2013 the 2014 increase is primarily due to the increased debt borrowings from the jpmorgan credit facility term loan of 5500 million at adjusted libor rates as mentioned in note 8 which helped fund the wright acquisition and the 5000 million senior notes due 2024 at an interest rate of 4200 which were issued during september 2014 the 2013 increases were due primarily to the additional debt borrowed in connection with our acquisition of beecher carlson 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805— business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair values of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years 

 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2014 the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 as defined in asc 820 fair value measurement “asc 820” the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were as follows in thousands 

 

 the fair values of the estimated earnout payables were increased in 2014 and 2013 since certain acquisitions performed at higher levels than estimated in our original projections conversely the fair values of the estimated earnout payables were reduced in 2012 since certain acquisitions did not perform at the level estimated based on our original projections an acquisition is considered to be performing well if its operating profit exceeds the level needed to reach the minimum purchase price however a reduction in the estimated acquisition earnout payable can occur even though the acquisition is performing well if it is not performing at the level contemplated by our original estimate 

as of december 31 2014 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 75283000 of which 26018000 was recorded as accounts payable and 49265000 was recorded as an other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2013 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 43058000 of which 6312000 was recorded as accounts payable and 36746000 was recorded as an other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2012 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 52987000 of which 10164000 was recorded as accounts payable and 42823000 was recorded as an other noncurrent liability 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 391 in 2014 393 in 2013 and 396 in 2012 the lower effective annual tax rates are primarily the result of lower average effective state income tax rates driven by revenue apportionment 

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services segments on a segmental basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses result from completed acquisitions within a given segment in a particular year likewise other income in each segment primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment management emphasizes the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in contrast the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period core organic commissions and fees attempts to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates the net changes in each of these three components can be determined for each of our customers 

 

the internal growth rates for our core organic commissions and fees for the three years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 by segment are as follows in thousands except percentages

 retail segment 

the retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 855 of the retail segment’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions net of related compensation which we receive will be reflected in our pretax income subject to incremental investments in new producers or other investments to help grow the business 

 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail segment is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

 the retail segment’s total revenues in 2014 increased 112 or 814 million over the same period in 2013 to 8098 million profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2014 increased 50 million or 203 over 2013 to 293 million primarily due to improved loss ratios resulting in increased profitability for insurance companies in 2013 the 798 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 734 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2013 ii a decrease of 75 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested during 2013 and 2014 and iii the remaining net increase of 139 million primarily related to net new business the retail segment’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 20 for 2014 and was driven by net new customers increasing insurable exposure units in certain areas of the united states and was partially offset by continued pressure on property and casualty rates especially in coastal areas 

income before income taxes for 2014 decreased 35 or 58 million over the same period in 2013 to 1605 million this decrease was primarily due to a higher interest charge of 85 million corresponding to capital utilized for acquisitions in 2014 and 90 million related to the yearonyear changes in the estimated earnout payable the underlying increase was driven by net new business acquired business and increased profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs noncash stockbased compensation increased 27 million or 296 for 2014 over the same period in 2013 as the cost of grants to employees for the purpose of driving performance were realized 

the retail segment’s total revenues in 2013 increased 130 or 839 million over the same period in 2012 to 7283 million profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2013 increased 47 million or 236 over 2012 to 244 million primarily due to improved loss ratios resulting in increased profitability for insurance companies in 2012 the 808 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 795 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2012 ii a decrease of 75 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2012 from business divested during 2013 and iii the remaining net increase of 90 million primarily related to net new business the retail segment’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 15 for 2013 and was driven by slightly increasing insurable exposure units in most areas of the united states and slight increases in general insurance premium rates 

 

income before income taxes for 2013 increased 145 or 211 million over the same period in 2012 to 1663 million this increase was primarily due to net new business the increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and continued improved efficiencies relating to compensation and employee benefits and certain other operating expenses but which was partially offset by a 15 million reduction in other income primarily due to gains on the sale of books of businesses in 2012 these increases were also enhanced by changes in estimated acquisition earnout payables of 38 million but partially offset by a net increase in the intercompany interest expense allocation of 78 million the continued improved efficiencies relating to compensation and employee benefits and certain other operating expenses resulted mainly from such costs increasing at a lower rate than our growth in net new business however a portion of the improved ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues was the result of the 68 million of bonus compensation related to a special onetime bonus in 2012 which was not repeated in 2013 

national programs segment 

the wright insurance group acquisition was completed effective may 1 2014 with the wright acquisition completed the national programs segment manages over 50 programs with 40 wellcapitalized carrier partners in most cases the insurance carriers that support the programs have delegated underwriting and in many instances claimshandling authority to our programs operations these programs are generally distributed through nationwide networks of independent agents and brown  brown retail agents and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries trade groups professions public entities and market niches the national programs segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories commercial programs professional programs arrowhead insurance group programs public entityrelated programs and the national flood program like the retail and wholesale brokerage segments the national programs segment’s revenue is primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs segment is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

  

the national programs segment’s total revenues in 2014 increased 1027 million to 3948 million a 351 increase over 2013 core commission and fees increased by 954 million due to the following factors i an increase of approximately 938 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from the wright and beecher carlson acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2013 ii a decrease of approximately 36 million in books of business that were disposed or transferred to other segments and iii the remaining increase of 52 million is primarily related to net new business profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2014 increased 14 million over 2013 due primarily to a 05 million increase in profitsharing contingent commissions received by florida intracoastal underwriters limited company “fiu” and a 08 million increase in profitsharing contingent commissions received by proctor financial inc “proctor” other income increased by approximately 57 million primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of industry consulting group inc “icg” of 60 million 

income before income taxes for 2014 increased 220 or 129 million over the same period in 2013 to 712 million the increase in income before taxes was due to net new business growth noted above revenues and operating profits derived from wright the gain on the sale of icg and a noncash stockbased compensation decrease of 38 million primarily related to partial sip grant forfeitures associated to arrowhead the 712 million increase was partially offset by an increase in the intercompany interest expense charge related to wright 

the national programs segment’s total revenues in 2013 increased 392 million to 2921 million a 155 increase over 2012 profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2013 increased 06 million over 2012 due primarily to a 37 million increase in profitsharing contingent commissions received by fiu which was partially offset by a decrease of 35 million at proctor the 385 million net increase in core commissions and fees resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 71 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2012 and ii the remaining net increase of 314 million primarily related to net new business therefore the national programs segment’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 135 for 2013 of the 314 million of net new business 277 million related to a net increase in commissions and fees revenue from our arrowhead operations 

income before income taxes for 2013 increased 134 or 69 million over the same period in 2012 to 584 million this net increase was primarily due to the new automobile aftermarket and the nonstandard auto programs at our arrowhead subsidiary even though these programs increased the total operating profit dollars for the segment the increase in the ratios of employee compensation and benefits and other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues over the prior year this was due to the fact that these programs operated at a higher cost factor than the average program operated in 2012

changes in internal controls 

we are in the process of integrating pacific resources benefits advisors llc and the wright insurance group llc into our overall internal control over financial reporting processes 

except as described above there have been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2014 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and by fees paid by customers for certain services commissions are usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases we share commissions with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “profitsharing contingent commission” which is a profitsharing commission based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and catastrophe claims adjusting services 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers and 3 our retail division for fees received in lieu of commissions primarily since our july 1 2013 acquisition of beecher carlson which services many larger feebased accounts the amount of our revenues from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels

 industry overview 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting riskbearing industry has historically been cyclical in nature and has varied widely based on market conditions for example in late 2003 after three years of a “hard” market in which premium rates were stable or increasing the insurance industry experienced the return of a “soft” market characterized by flat or reduced premium rates in many lines and geographic areas in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the southeastern united states experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida and the following year brought this region the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by insurance companies due to these hurricanes property and casualty insurance premium rates increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern united states in 2006 while otherwise generally declining during 2006 and 2007 

to counter the higher property insurance rates in florida the state of florida directed its property “insurer of last resort” “citizens property insurance corporation” “citizens” to significantly reduce its rates beginning in january 2007 and extending through january 1 2010 as a result several of our floridabased operations lost significant amounts of revenue to citizens in this period since that time citizens’ impact on our operations has declined each year as citizens has slowly increased its rates in an effort to reduce its insured exposures our commission revenues from citizens for 2013 2012 and 2011 were approximately 57 million 64 million and 78 million respectively if as expected this trend continues the financial impact of citizens on our business should continue to decrease in 2014 

 

although property and casualty insurance premium rates generally continued to decline from 2008 through 2011 in most lines of coverage the rates of decline were slowing however from the second half of 2008 through 2011 insurable exposure units such as sales and payroll expenditures decreased significantly primarily in the southeastern and western regions of the united states due to the economic recession and this decrease had a greater adverse impact on our commissions and fees revenue than did declining insurance premium rates in this period 

from the first quarter of 2012 through 2013 insurance premium rates gradually increased for most lines of coverage and insurable exposure units began to flatten and in many cases increase as a result in 2012 we achieved positive internal organic core commissions and fees revenue growth for the first time since 2006 in 2013 these rate and exposure unit increases along with strong new business growth generated positive internal organic revenue growth for each of our four reportable business divisions in each quarter with the single exception of the fourth quarter for our services division which experienced a record fourth quarter in 2012 as a result of the significant flood claims activity from superstorm sandy that was not replicated in 2013 

we currently expect that property and casualty insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units will generally continue to increase modestly and gradually during 2014 subject to continued improvement in the economic environment

services division 

at december 31 2013 our services division employed 785 persons and provided a widerange of insurancerelated services 

below are brief descriptions of the programs offered by the services division 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

in 2013 our three largest workers’ compensation contracts represented approximately 60 of our services division’s fees revenues or approximately 08 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue 

employees 

at december 31 2013 we had 6992 fulltime equivalent employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their ability to solicit business from our customers or to hire our employees for a period of time after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us in the southeastern united states particularly outside of florida and elsewhere 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct sales efforts have had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is mostly commercially oriented rather than individually oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors tableend we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

we are primarily engaged in the insurance agency wholesale brokerage and insurance programs business and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

current us economic conditions and the shift away from traditional insurance markets may continue to adversly affect our business 

from late 2007 through 2011 global consumer confidence had eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values volatility in energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit high unemployment and the stability and solvency of financial institutions financial markets businesses and sovereign nations those concerns slowed economic growth and resulted in a recession in the united states economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations during the years 2008 through 2011 due to reduced customer demand in 2012 the economic conditions in the middlemarket economy appeared to stabilize and a gradual improvement continued through 2013 however if these economic conditions worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in values of insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers also if general economic conditions are poor some of our clients may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if these clients are affected by poor economic conditions but yet remain in existence they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties which could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of profitability as traditional insurance markets 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel increase in expenses and working capital requirements which could reduce our return on invested capital entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payables and tax and accounting issues some or 

 

all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows postacquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution andor goodwill impairment charges 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

traditionally we have maintained cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic while we began in the fall of 2008 refocusing our investment and cash management strategy by moving more of our cash into noninterest bearing accounts which were fdicinsured until december 31 2012 and not subject to any limits and money market accounts a portion of which became fdic insured in the fall of 2008 we still maintain cash and investment balances in excess of the current limits insured by fdic as the credit crisis persists the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the further disruption in the usbased credit markets and by further instability of financial systems 

the disruption in the usbased credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets over the past few years have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies these conditions include significant losses greater volatility significantly less liquidity widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets while these conditions have somewhat abated since the fall of 2008 it is difficult to predict when these conditions will completely end and the extent to which our markets products and business will be adversely affected 

the unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and limited access to capital and credit for many companies although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2016 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer our clients we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited 

inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 

given the current macroeconomic environment it is possible that us government actions in the form of a monetary stimulus a fiscal stimulus or both to the us economy could lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base resulting in an increase in our employee compensation and benefits and our other operating expenses this could harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation on our cost base 

 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2013 fiscal year we have 2006173000 of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2013 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see notes 1—“summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3—“goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising brown  brown is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year brown  brown assesses the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities as disclosed in prior years certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the company has not chosen to discontinue receiving profitsharing contingent commissions or override commissions the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while we cannot predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations further if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions it would likely adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question also the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs including punitive damages such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis in addition given the longtail nature of professional liability claims errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2013 no insurance company accounted for more than 80 of our total core commissions for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 50 and 52 of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company respectively should this insurance company seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business and we could likely move our business to one of these other insurance companies although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida georgia indiana kansas massachusetts michigan new jersey new york oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida georgia indiana kansas massachusetts michigan new jersey new york oregon pennsylvania texas virginia and washington for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we derived 11237 million or 829 9767 million or 821 and 8035 million or 799 of our commissions and fees respectively from our operations located in these states we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to customers in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have expanded our operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

in 2008 we expanded our operations to the united kingdom in addition we acquired retail operations based in hamilton bermuda and george town cayman islands in july 2013 as part of the beecher carlson transaction in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to selfinsure because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or customers are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance intermediaries than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders as a result such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs restricting the products or services we may sell the markets we may enter the methods by which we may sell our products and services or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our clients carriers and third parties the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year these commissions generally have accounted for 43 to 44 of our previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to among other things potentially poor macroeconomic conditions the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing 

 

calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that may be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may not be able to develop and implement new technologies as quickly as our competitors 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report results to carriers an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs while we have taken and continue to take actions to protect the security and privacy of our information entirely eliminating all risk of improper access to private information is not possible 

 

we are taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

we are subject to litigation which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are and may be subject to a number of claims regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome of these claims actions and proceedings with certainty 

an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services while our key personnel are prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a period of years following separation from employment with us they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to continue to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current customers merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the overall amount of work that we perform for these customers if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that customer or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

healthcare reform and increased costs of current employees’ medical and other benefits could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

our profitability is affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of economic factors beyond our control although we have actively sought to contain increases in these costs there can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

in addition we believe that increased health care costs resulting from the 2010 health care reform bill could have a material adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events 

our operations may be subject to natural disasters or other business disruptions which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes including in florida where our headquarters are located earthquakes including california where we maintain a relatively large number of offices power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2013 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 183 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his family members which include his sons j powell brown our president and chief executive officer and p barrett brown one of our regional vice presidents beneficially owned approximately 164 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

 

changes in laws and regulations may increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended “sarbanesoxley” and the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 have required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of these acts the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated and will likely continue to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects these developments have increased and may increase in the future our compliance costs may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

from time to time new regulations are enacted or existing requirements are changed and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted legislative developments that could adversely affect us include changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments for example the 2010 health care reform legislation and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or in certain cases property insurance in catastropheprone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace insurance products offered by insurance carriers also as global warming issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on global warming may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 and future yearends as required by section 404 of sarbanesoxley investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of our shares 

as directed by section 404 of sarbanesoxley the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements however if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 

we attempt to foster a strong decentralized sales culture with a goal of consistent sustained growth over the long term 

we increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2013 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues dropped 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 14 billion in 2013 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 142 in the same 20 year period we increased net income from 80 million to 2171 million in 2013 a compound annual growth rate of 179 

the years 2007 through 2011 posed significant challenges for us and for our industry in the form of a prevailing decline in insurance premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” and increased significant governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace which resulted in a substantial loss of revenues for us additionally beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2011 there was a general decline in insurable exposure units as the consequence of the general weakening of the economy in the united states as a result from the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 we experienced negative internal revenue growth each quarter the continued declining exposure units during 2011 and 2010 had a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than declining insurance premium rates 

beginning in the first quarter of 2012 many insurance premium rates began to slightly increase additionally in the second quarter of 2012 the general declines in insurable exposure units started to flatten and these exposures units subsequently began to gradually increase during the year as a result we recorded positive internal revenue growth for each quarter of 2012 for each of our four divisions with two exceptions the first quarter for the retail division and the third quarter for the national programs division in which declines of only 07 and 33 respectively were experienced 

this growth trend has continued into 2013 with our consolidated internal revenue growth rate of 67 additionally each of our four divisions recorded positive internal revenue growth for each quarter in 2013 except for the services division in the fourth quarter the decline in the core organic commissions and fees revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013 for the services division was the result of the significant revenue recorded at our colonial claims operation in the fourth quarter of 2012 attributable to superstorm sandy for which no comparable revenues occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013 in the event that the gradual increases in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units that occurred in 2013 continue into 2014 we expect to see continued positive quarterly internal revenue growth rates on a yearoveryear basis for 2014 excluding the impact relating to our colonial claims operation in the first quarter of 2013 colonial claims earned claims fees of 172 million as a direct result of the continued significant claims activity from superstorm sandy absent another major flooding event we estimate colonial claims revenues for the first quarter of 2014 to be less than 10 million 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 44 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are typically included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in contrast the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the 

 

core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period “core organic commissions and fees” are reported in this manner in order to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates the net changes in each of these three components can be determined for each of our customers however because our agency management accounting systems do not aggregate such data it is not reportable core organic commissions and fees can reflect either “positive” growth with a net increase in revenues or “negative” growth with a net decrease in revenues 

beginning a few years ago five to six national insurance companies replaced their lossratio based profitsharing contingent commission agreements with a new guaranteed fixedbase agreements referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” for 2013 only four national insurance companies still used gscs in lieu of lossratio based profitsharing contingent commissions since gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written as of december 31 2013 we accrued and earned 83 million of gscs during 2013 most of which will be collected in the first quarter of 2014 for the twelvemonth periods ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we earned 83 million 91 million and 121 million respectively of gscs 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and catastrophe claims adjusting services and 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies these services are provided over a period of time typically one year however in conjunction with our july 1 2013 acquisition of beecher carlson which has a primary focus on large retail customers that generally pay us fees directly the fee revenues in our retail division for 2013 have increased by nearly 400 million to 730 million for 2014 we expect the total fees in our retail division to be approximately 1100 million fee revenues on a consolidated basis as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 266 in 2013 217 in 2012 and 164 in 2011 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities as a result of the bank liquidity and solvency issues in the united states in the last quarter of 2008 we moved substantial amounts of our cash into noninterest bearing checking accounts so that they would be fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” or into moneymarket investment funds a portion of which is fdic insured of suntrust and wells fargo two large national banks effective january 1 2013 the fdic ceased providing insurance guarantees on noninterest bearing checking accounts and since that time we have invested in both interest bearing and noninterest bearing checking accounts investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments other income primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets but will also include subrental income legal settlements and other miscellaneous income 

current year company overview 

2013 was a strong year for revenue growth and continued the positive trends that began in 2012 after the fiveyear period extending from 2007 to 2011 in which we experienced negative internal growth in our core organic commissions and fees revenue which we believe was a direct result of the general weakness of the economy we achieved a positive internal revenue growth of 26 in 2012 and 67 in 2013 

the net growth in core organic commissions and fees in 2013 of 756 million is a significant improvement over the comparable growth in 2012 of 249 million and the net lost revenues of 215 million in 2011 of the 756 million growth in the 2013 core organic commissions and fees 381 million was generated by two new programs at our arrowhead operation the automobile aftermarket program and the nonstandard auto program and from our colonial claims operation as a result of the significant claims activity attributable to superstorm sandy the remaining growth in the core organic commissions and fees revenue is principally attributable to rising insurance premium rates and increasing insurance exposure units as a result of a gradually improving u s economy 

we continue to be successful in acquiring insurance operations that we believe are strategic in growing our business divisions in each of the last two years we completed acquisitions with aggregate revenues in excess of 1428 million nine acquisitions in 2013 with estimated revenues of 1428 million and 20 acquisitions in 2012 with estimated revenues of 1496 million for 2014 we are continuing this trend with the announced acquisition of wright insurance group with estimated annualized revenues of 1200 million which is expected to close on or around april 1 2014 

income before income taxes in 2013 increased over 2012 by 173 or 528 million to 3576 million however that net increase of 528 million includes 143 million of income before income taxes related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore income before income taxes from offices that existed in the same time periods of 2013 and 2012 including the 

 

new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 385 million the net increase of 385 million related primarily to 1 net new business 2 a 26 million benefit from a change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and 3 a onetime 68 million bonus earned in 2012 by our retail division commissioned producers as a result of a special program for those whose 2012 production exceeded their 2011 production by at least five percent these net increases were partially offset by a 66 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation primarily due to new grants issued in july 2013 therefore excluding these items income before income taxes from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2013 and 2012 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 377 million 

acquisitions 

approximately 38500 independent insurance agencies are estimated to be operating currently in the united states part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through 2013 we acquired 449 insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts 

a summary of our acquisitions over the last three years is as follows in millions except for number of acquisitions 

 

 on july 1 2013 we completed the acquisition of beecher carlson holdings inc “beecher carlson” an insurance and risk management broker with operations that include retail brokerage program management and captive management the aggregate purchase price for beecher carlson was 4693 million including 3643 million of cash payments and the assumption of 1050 million of liabilities beecher carlson was acquired primarily to expand brown  brown’s retail and national programs businesses and to attract and hire highquality individuals 

on january 9 2012 we completed the acquisition of arrowhead general insurance agency superholding corporation “arrowhead” pursuant to a merger agreement dated december 15 2011 the “merger agreement” under the merger agreement the total cash purchase price of 3950 million was subject to adjustments for options to purchase shares of arrowhead’s common stock working capital sharing of net operating tax losses arrowhead’s preferred stock units transaction expenses and closing debt in addition within 60 days following the third anniversary of the acquisition’s closing date we will pay to certain persons who were arrowhead equityholders as of the closing date additional earnout payments equal collectively to 50 million subject to certain adjustments based on the “cumulative ebitda” of arrowhead and all of its subsidiaries as calculated pursuant to the merger agreement during the final year of the threeyear period following the acquisition’s closing date 

arrowhead is a national insurance program manager and one of the largest managing general agents “mgas” in the property and casualty insurance industry 

on january 15 2014 as previously announced we entered into an agreement to acquire the wright insurance group llc “wright” with estimated annualized revenues of 1200 million this transaction is expected to close on or around april 1 2014 wright’s operations include a national flood insurance program governmentsponsored insurance programs and proprietary national and regional programs the total net consideration to be paid for the ownership interests of wright is 6025 million in addition to contingent consideration of up to 375 million if wright completes certain agreedupon acquisitions prior to closing the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including hartscottrodino approval and other related regulatory approvals 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1—summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later commission revenues related to installment billings at the company’s subsidiary arrowhead are recorded on the later of the effective date of the policy or the first installment billing at those dates the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification from insurance companies concerning matters necessitating such adjustments profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received from insurance companies or when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

acquisition purchase prices are typically based on a multiple of average annual operating profit earned over a oneto threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” or on a discounted cash flow basis 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and assesses the recoverability of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related 

 

assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2013 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options and nonvested stock awards to our employees and the related compensation expense is required to be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

litigation claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs increased 1664 million or 140 in 2013 profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs increased 67 million or 127 in 2013 to 595 million due primarily to 47 million 06 million and 13 million increases in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in our retail national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions respectively core commissions and fees revenue in 2013 increased 1597 million of which approximately 915 million represented core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2012 after taking into account divested business of 74 million the remaining net increase of 756 million representing net new business reflects a 67 internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs increased 1831 million or 182 in 2012 profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs decreased 24 million or 44 in 2012 to 528 million due primarily to 41 million and 12 million reductions in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in our retail and wholesale brokerage divisions respectively but these reductions were partially offset by a 32 million increase in our national programs division core commissions and fees revenue increased 1856 million of which approximately 1714 million represented core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2011 after taking into account divested business of 107 million the remaining net increase of 249 million representing net new business reflects a 26 internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees 

 

investment income 

investment income decreased to 06 million in 2013 compared with 08 million in 2012 mainly due to lower average daily invested balances in 2013 than in 2012 investment income of 08 million in 2012 was down 05 million as compared with 2011 mainly due to lower average daily invested balances in 2012 than in 2011 

other income net 

other income for 2013 reflected income of 71 million compared with 102 million in 2012 and 63 million in 2011 we recognized gains of 31 million 43 million and 23 million from sales of books of business customer accounts in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively although we are not in the business of selling books of business we periodically will sell an office or a book of business because it does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or for other reasons related to the particular assets in question other income also included 16 million 36 million and 13 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively paid to us in connection with settlements of litigation against former employees for violation of restrictive covenants contained in their employment agreements with us additionally we recognized nonrecurring gains rental income and sales of software services of 24 million 23 million and 23 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased approximately 122 or 745 million in 2013 however that net increase included 376 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2013 and 2012 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 369 million the employee compensation and benefit increases from these offices were primarily related to increases in staff and management salaries of 166 million new salaried producers of 47 million profit center and other related bonuses of 34 million compensation to our commissioned producers of 57 million health insurance costs of 18 million payrollrelated taxes of 37 million and other net expenses of 10 million 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased on a net basis approximately 196 or 998 million in 2012 however that net increase included 809 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2012 and 2011 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 189 million the employee compensation and benefit increases from these offices were primarily related to increases in staff and management salaries of 32 million new salaried producers of 13 million profit center bonuses of 14 million health insurance costs of 18 million employee 401kprofitsharing contributions of 07 million and bonus incentives of 81 million primarily due to 68 million earned by our retail division commissioned producers as a result of a special onetime bonus program for those whose 2012 production exceeded their 2011 production by at least 5 

employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased in 2013 to 501 as compared to 507 for 2012 and 502 for 2011 we had 6992 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2013 compared with 6438 at december 31 2012 and 5557 at december 31 2011 of the net increase of 554 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2013 over the prior yearend an increase of 374 was attributable to acquisitions thus reflecting a net increase of 180 employees in the offices existing at both yearends 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we have an employee stock purchase plan and grant stock options and nonvested stock awards to our employees compensation expense for all sharebased awards is recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards for 2013 2012 and 2011 the noncash stockbased compensation expense incorporates the costs related to each of our four stockbased plans as explained in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

noncash stockbased compensation increased 425 or 67 million in 2013 over 2012 primarily as a result of new nonvested stock awards granted on july 1 2013 under our stock incentive plan “sip” most of these sip grants will typically vest in four to seven years subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria by grantees and the achievement of consolidated earnings per share growth at certain levels by us over threeto fiveyear measurement periods some sip grants will vest after five years of service 

noncash stockbased compensation increased 417 or 47 million in 2012 over 2011 as a result of new grants under our stock incentive plan “sip” these sip grants will typically vest in four to ten years subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria by grantees and the achievement of consolidated earnings per share growth at certain levels by us over threeto fiveyear measurement periods 

 

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 144 in 2013 145 in 2012 and 142 in 2011 

other operating expenses in 2013 increased 213 million over 2012 of which 125 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses attributable to offices that existed in the same periods in both 2013 and 2012 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 88 million of the 88 million increase 20 million related to increased data processing and software licensing expense 20 million related to increased inspection and consulting fees 16 million related to increased accounting and advisory fees 09 million related to increased employee sales meeting costs and 29 million related to other various net cost increases these increased costs were partially offset by a decrease of 06 million for legal claims and litigation expenses 

other operating expenses in 2012 increased 303 million over 2011 of which 333 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses attributable to offices that existed in the same periods in both 2012 and 2011 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 30 million of the 30 million decrease 27 million related to reductions in office rents and related expenses 22 million related to a reduction in legal expenses and 20 million related to lower insurance costs these cost savings were partially offset by increases of 13 million in consulting and inspection services 11 million for litigation reserves and 10 million in employee sales meetings 

amortization 

amortization expense increased 44 million or 69 in 2013 and 88 million or 161 in 2012 the increases in 2013 and 2012 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation increased 137 in 2013 and 241 in 2012 the increases in 2013 and 2012 were due primarily to the addition of fixed assets as a result of recent acquisitions 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 03 million or 21 in 2013 and 20 million or 139 in 2012 the 2013 and 2012 increases were due primarily to the additional debt borrowed in connection with our acquisitions of beecher carlson in 2013 and arrowhead in 2012 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805— business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair values of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2013 the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were as follows in thousands 

 

  

the fair values of the estimated earnout payables were increased in 2013 since certain acquisitions performed at higher levels than estimated on our original projections the fair values of the estimated earnout payables were reduced in 2012 and 2011 since certain acquisitions did not perform at the level estimated based on our original projections an acquisition is considered to be performing well if its operating profit exceeds the level needed to reach the minimum purchase price however a reduction in the estimated acquisition earnout payable can occur even though the acquisition is performing well if it is not performing at the level contemplated by our original estimate 

as of december 31 2013 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 43058000 of which 6312000 was recorded as accounts payable and 36746000 was recorded as other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2012 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 52987000 of which 10164000 was recorded as accounts payable and 42823000 was recorded as other noncurrent liability 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 393 in 2013 396 in 2012 and 394 in 2011 the lower effective annual tax rates are primarily the result of lower average effective state income tax rates 

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments or divisions the retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses result from completed acquisitions within a given division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management emphasizes the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in contrast the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period core organic commissions and fees attempts to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates the net changes in each of these three components can be determined for each of our customers however because our agency management accounting systems do not aggregate such data it is not reportable core organic commissions and fees reflect either “positive” growth with a net increase in revenues or “negative” growth with a net decrease in revenues 

the internal growth rates for our core organic commissions and fees for the three years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 by division are as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 is as follows in thousands

 retail division 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 899 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions net of related compensation which we receive will be reflected in our pretax income 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

  

the retail division’s total revenues in 2013 increased 130 or 839 million over the same period in 2012 to 7283 million profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2013 increased 47 million or 236 over 2012 to 244 million primarily due to improved loss ratios resulting in increased profitability for insurance companies in 2013 the 808 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 795 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2012 ii a decrease of 75 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2012 from business divested during 2013 and iii the remaining net increase of 90 million primarily related to net new business the retail division’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 15 for 2013 and was driven by slightly increasing insurable exposure units in most areas of the united states and slight increases in general insurance premium rates 

income before income taxes for 2013 increased 145 or 211 million over the same period in 2012 to 1663 million this increase was primarily due to net new business the increase in profitsharing contingent commissions and continued improved efficiencies relating to compensation and employee benefits and certain other operating expenses but which was partially offset by a 15 million reduction in other income primarily due to gains on the sale of books of businesses in 2012 these increases were also enhanced by changes in estimated acquisition earnout payables of 38 million but partially offset by a net increase in the intercompany interest expense allocation of 78 million the continued improved efficiencies relating to compensation and employee benefits and certain other operating expenses resulted mainly from such costs increasing at a lower rate than our growth in net new business however a portion of the improved ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues was the result of the 68 million of bonus compensation related to a special onetime bonus in 2012 which was not repeated in 2013 

the retail division’s total revenues in 2012 increased 61 or 372 million over the same period in 2011 to 6444 million profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2012 decreased 41 million or 172 from 2011 to 197 million primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance companies in 2011 and to the fact that two national insurance carriers who provided us gsc contracts in 2011 changed to profitsharing contingency contracts in 2012 the 389 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 387 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2011 ii a decrease of 85 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2011 from business divested or transferred to the wholesale brokerage division during 2012 and iii the remaining net increase of 87 million primarily related to net new business the retail division’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 15 for 2012 and resulted primarily from stabilizing insurable exposure units with slightly stronger upward pressure on general insurance premium rates 

income before income taxes for 2012 increased 54 or 74 million over the same period in 2011 to 1452 million included in the 74 million net increase in income before income taxes is another 74 million net expense increase in change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and a 03 million net expense increase from amortization depreciation and intercompany interest changes excluding these items and the 41 million decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs income before income taxes for 2012 increased 192 million over 2011 of which 87 million originated from new acquisitions that were standalone operations and 105 million was generated by offices in existence in both 2011 and 2012 of the 105 million increase from existing offices 87 million 14 million of foldin acquired revenues was attributed to organic growth of core commissions and fees 56 million cost savings from other operating expenses 05 reduction in noncash stockbased compensation but partially offset by 49 million increase in compensation and employee benefits the 49 million net increase in compensation and employee benefits was primarily due to the onetime producer bonuses of 68 million paid to commissioned producers whose 2012 production exceeded their 2011 production by at least five percent which was partially offset by a reduction of approximately 20 million less staff salaries the 56 million reduction in other operating expenses was primarily related to reductions in occupancyoffice rents legal and claims settlements insurance expense and data processing costs

income before income taxes for 2013 increased 134 or 69 million over the same period in 2012 to 584 million this net increase was primarily due to the new automobile aftermarket and the nonstandard auto programs at our arrowhead subsidiary even though these programs increased the total operating profit dollars for the division the ratios of employee compensation and benefits and other operating expenses as a percentage to total revenues increased over the prior year was due to the fact that these programs operated at a higher cost factor than the average program operated in 2012 

 

the national programs division’s total revenues in 2012 increased 885 million to 2529 million a 538 increase over 2011 profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2012 increased 32 million over 2011 due primarily to profitsharing contingent commissions earned at our arrowhead operation of the 844 million net increase in core commissions and fees for national programs i an increase of approximately 833 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2011 and ii a net increase of 11 million was primarily related to net new business therefore the national programs division’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 08 for 2012 of the 11 million of net new business 22 million related to a net increase in commissions and fees revenue at proctor which was partially offset by 17 million of net lost business in our facultative reinsurance facility and the remaining 06 million of net new business was generated by various other programs 

income before income taxes for 2012 decreased 148 or 90 million from the same period in 2011 to 515 million this net decrease was due to i a reduction of 56 million from the offices that existed in both 2012 and 2011 primarily as a result of reduced profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs of 13 million and increased compensation expense mainly related to increased staffing levels at proctor ii loss before income taxes and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables of 48 million related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices primarily the arrowhead acquisition and iii a 14 million income credit generated from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables income before income taxes and intercompany interest expense related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices primarily the arrowhead acquisition that had no comparable earnings in the same period of 2011 was approximately 217 million for 2012 however those earnings were offset by 250 million of intercompany interest expense allocation

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with the suntrust revolver the new master agreement and the wells fargo revolver will be sufficient to satisfy our 

 

normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2014 these liquidity needs include the total net consideration of 6025 million to be paid for the ownership interests of wright in addition contingent consideration of up to 375 million may be payable if wright completes certain agreedupon acquisitions prior to closing we currently anticipate financing this transaction with a combination of cash and proceeds from one or more existing or new credit facilities we may seek to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets to increase our cash and debt capacity additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototalcapitalization ratio we would be able to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets this incurrence of additional debt however could negatively impact our capital structure and liquidity in addition if we are unable to raise as much additional debt as we want or at all we could issue additional equity to finance an acquisition which could have a dilutive effect on our current shareholders

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 management’s report on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 is incorporated herein at item 8 deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 which is incorporated herein at item 8 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

industry overview 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting riskbearing industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the dampening effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 premium rates generally increased beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 

during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by insurance companies from these hurricanes insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states insurance premium rates generally declined during 2006 in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in florida as discussed below insurance premium rates continued to decline from 2007 through 2011 in most of the other us regions 

although insurance premium rates declined from 2008 through 2011 in most lines of coverage the rates of decline appeared to be slowing however during the second half of 2008 through 2011 insurable exposure units such as sales and payroll expenditures declined significantly due to the weakening economy primarily in the southeastern and western parts of the united states from 2008 through 2011 declining exposure units had a greater adverse impact on our commissions and fees revenue than did declining insurance premium rates 

in the first quarter of 2012 insurance premium rates began to gradually increase for most lines of coverage correspondingly insurable exposure units began to flatten and in many cases began to increase as a result of increases in both insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units we achieved positive internal organic revenue growth of our 2012 core commissions and fees for the first time since 2006 general insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units are expected to continue to modestly and gradually increase during 2013

at december 31 2012 we had 6438 fulltime equivalent employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their ability to solicit business from our customers or to hire our employees for a period of time after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

  

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere particularly outside of florida 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct sales efforts have had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially rather than individually oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors tableend we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

we are primarily engaged in the insurance agency wholesale brokerage and insurance programs business and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

current us economic conditions and the shift away from traditional insurance markets may continue to adversly affect our business 

since late 2007 global consumer confidence has eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values volatility in energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit high unemployment and the stability and solvency of financial institutions financial markets businesses and sovereign nations these concerns have slowed economic growth and resulted in a recession in the united states economic conditions have had a negative impact on our results of operations during the years since 2008 due to reduced customer demand if these economic conditions worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including declines in values of insurable exposure units declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of profitability as traditional insurance markets 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payable and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

traditionally we have maintained cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic while we began in the fall of 2008 refocusing our investment and cash management strategy by moving more of our cash into noninterest bearing accounts which were fdicinsured until december 31 2012 and not subject to any limits and money market accounts a portion of which became fdic insured in the fall of 2008 we still maintain cash and investment balances in excess of the current limits insured by fdic as the credit crisis persists the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the further disruption in the usbased credit markets and by further instability of financial systems 

the disruption in the usbased credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets over the past few years have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies these conditions include significant losses greater volatility significantly less liquidity widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets while these conditions have somewhat abated since the fall of 2008 it is difficult to predict when these conditions will completely end and the extent to which our markets products and business will be adversely affected 

the unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and limited access to capital and credit for many companies although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2016 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited 

inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 

given the current macroeconomic environment it is possible that us government actions in the form of a monetary stimulus a fiscal stimulus or both to the us economy could lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base resulting in an increase in our employee compensation and benefits and our other operating expenses this could harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation on our cost base 

  

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2012 fiscal year we have 1711514000 of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2012 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see notes 1 – “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 – “goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

additionally the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising brown  brown is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable accordingly if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year brown  brown assesses the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted however no impairments have been recorded for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities as disclosed in prior years certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the company has not chosen to discontinue receiving profitsharing contingent commissions or override commissions the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while we cannot predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations further if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions it would likely adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

  

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2012 no insurance company accounted for more than 50 of our total core commissions for the year ended december 31 2011 and 2010 approximately 52 and 50 of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company respectively should this insurance company seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida georgia indiana massachusetts michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida georgia indiana massachusetts michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we derived 9332 million or 785 7657 million or 761 and 7390 million or 764 of our commissions and fees respectively from our operations located in these states we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to customers in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have expanded our operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

in 2008 we expanded our operations to the united kingdom this was the first time we have opened an office outside the united states in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or customers are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year these commissions generally have accounted for 43 to 57 of our previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

  

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that may be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report results to carriers an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

we are taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

  

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

we are subject to litigation which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are and may be subject to a number of claims regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome of these claims actions and proceedings with certainty 

an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services as previously disclosed certain of our former executive officers ceased employment with us during the past three years while they are prohibited from soliciting our employees and customers they are not prohibited from competing with us 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current customers merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the overall amount of work that we perform for these customers if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that customer or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

healthcare reform and increased costs of current employees’ medical and other benefits could have a materially adverse affect on our business 

our profitability is affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of economic factors beyond our control although we have actively sought to contain increases in these costs there can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

in addition we believe that increased health care costs resulting from the 2010 health care reform bill could have a material adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events 

our operations may be subject to natural disasters or other business disruptions which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes including in florida where our headquarters are located earthquakes including california where we maintain a relatively large number of offices including those acquired in the arrowhead transaction power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2012 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 184 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his family members which include his son powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 166 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

changes in laws and regulations may increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended “sarbanesoxley” and the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 have required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of these acts the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated and will continue to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs while these costs are no longer increasing they may in fact increase in the future these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage likewise these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

from time to time new regulations are enacted or existing requirements are changed and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted for example as global warming issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on global warming may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

  

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 and future yearends as required by section 404 of sarbanesoxley investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values or sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 

we foster a strong decentralized sales culture with a goal of consistent sustained growth over the long term as of january 2013 our senior leadership group included eight executive officers with regional responsibility for oversight of designated operations within the company and four regional vice presidents in our retail division and one regional vice president in our wholesale brokerage division who report directly to one of our executive officers in october 2012 kathy colangelo was promoted to be regional vice president of our wholesale brokerage division 

we increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2012 with the exception of 2009 when our revenues dropped 10 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 12 billion in 2012 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 142 in the same 19 year period we increased net income from 80 million to 1840 million in 2012 a compound annual growth rate of 179 

the years 2007 through 2011 posed significant challenges for us and for our industry in the form of a prevailing decline in insurance premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” and increased significant governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace which resulted in a substantial loss of revenues for us additionally beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2011 there was a general decline in insurable exposure units as the consequence of the general weakening of the economy in the united states as a result from the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 we experienced negative internal revenue growth each quarter part of the decline in 2007 was the result of the increased governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace as described below in “the florida insurance overview” in 2010 and 2011 continued declining exposure units had a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than declining insurance premium rates 

beginning in the first quarter of 2012 many insurance premium rates began to slightly increase additionally in the second quarter of 2012 the general declines in insurable exposure units started to flatten and these exposures units subsequently began to gradually increase during the year as a result we recorded positive internal revenue growth for each quarter of 2012 for each of our four divisions with two exceptions the first quarter for the retail division and the third quarter for the national programs division in which declines of only 07 and 33 respectively were experienced 

for 2012 our consolidated internal revenue growth rate was 26 in the event that the gradual increases in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units that occurred in 2012 continue in 2013 we should continue to see positive quarterly internal growth rates in 2013 

  

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but which may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 48 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are typically included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in contrast the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period core organic commissions and fees attempts to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes from i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates the net changes in each of these three components can be determined for each of our customers however because our agency management accounting systems do not aggregate such data it is not reportable core organic commissions and fees can reflect either “positive” growth with a net increase in revenues or “negative” growth with a net decrease in revenues 

in recent years five national insurance companies have replaced the lossratio based profitsharing contingent commission calculation with a guaranteed fixedbase methodology referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” since gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written as of december 31 2012 we accrued and earned 91 million from gscs during 2012 most of which will be collected in the first quarter of 2013 for the twelvemonth periods ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we earned 121 million and 134 million respectively from gscs 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and catastrophe claims adjusting services and 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies these services are provided over a period of time typically one year fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 217 in 2012 164 in 2011 and 146 in 2010 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities as a result of the bank liquidity and solvency issues in the united states in the last quarter of 2008 we moved substantial amounts of our cash into noninterest bearing checking accounts so that they would be fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” or into moneymarket investment funds a portion of which is fdic insured of suntrust and wells fargo two large national banks effective january 1 2013 the fdic ceased providing insurance guarantees on noninterest bearing checking accounts investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 

florida insurance overview 

many states have established “residual markets” which are governmental or quasigovernmental insurance facilities that are intended to provide coverage to individuals andor businesses that cannot buy insurance in the private marketplace ie “insurers of last resort” these facilities can be designed to cover any type of risk or exposure however the exposures most commonly subject to such facilities are automobile or highrisk property exposures residual markets can also be referred to as fair plans windstorm pools joint underwriting associations or may even be given names styled after the private sector like “citizens property insurance corporation” in florida 

in august 2002 the florida legislature created “citizens property insurance corporation” “citizens” to be the “insurer of last resort” in florida initially citizens charged insurance rates that were higher than those generally prevailing in the private insurance marketplace in each of 2004 and 2005 four major hurricanes made landfall in florida as a result of the ensuing significant insurance property losses florida property insurance rates increased in 2006 to counter the higher property insurance rates the state of florida instructed citizens to significantly reduce its property insurance rates beginning in january 2007 by state law citizens guaranteed these rates through january 1 2010 as a result citizens became one of the most if not the most competitive riskbearers for a large percentage of florida’s commercial habitational coastal property exposures such as condominiums apartments and certain assisted living facilities additionally citizens became the only insurance market for certain homeowner policies throughout florida today citizens is one of the largest underwriters of coastal property exposures in florida 

  

in 2007 citizens became the principal direct competitor of the insurance companies that underwrite the condominium program administered by one of our indirect subsidiaries florida intracoastal underwriters limited company “fiu” and the excess and surplus lines insurers represented by wholesale brokers such as hull  company inc another of our subsidiaries consequently these operations lost significant amounts of revenue to citizens from 2008 through 2012 citizens’ impact was not as dramatic as it had been in 2007 fiu’s core commissions and fees decreased 197 during this fouryear period citizens continued to be competitive against the excess and surplus lines insurers and therefore citizens negatively affected the revenues of our floridabased wholesale brokerage operations such as hull  company inc from 2007 through 2012 although the impact has been decreasing each year 

citizens’ impact on our florida retail offices was less severe than on our national programs and wholesale brokerage division operations because our retail offices have the ability to place business with citizens although at slightly lower commission rates and with greater difficulty than with other insurance companies 

effective january 1 2010 citizens raised its insurance rates on average 10 for properties with values of less than 10 million and more than 10 for properties with values in excess of 10 million citizens raised its insurance rates again in 2011 and 2012 and is expected to continue to increase its insurance rates in 2013 our commission revenues from citizens for 2012 2011 and 2010 were approximately 64 million 78 million and 83 million respectively if as expected citizens continues to attempt to reduce its insured exposures the financial impact of citizens on our business should continue to be reduced in 2013 

current year company overview 

2012 was an important transition year after five years of experiencing negative internal growth in our core organic commissions and fees revenue as a direct result of the general weakness of the economy we achieved a 26 positive internal revenue growth in 2012 which reflects a net growth of 249 million in core organic commissions and fees the net growth in core organic commissions and fees of 249 million is a significant improvement from the comparable net lost revenues of 215 million and 401 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively this improvement is principally attributable to rising insurance premium rates and increasing insurance exposure units as a result of a gradually improving u s economy 

we have also succeeded in acquiring insurance operations that we believe may be of incrementally higher quality in each of the last three years we completed 20 acquisitions in 2012 compared with the 38 and 33 acquisitions made in 2011 and 2010 respectively however the estimated annualized revenues from the 2012 acquisitions excluding acquired books of business customer accounts were 1496 million an increase over the 887 million and 706 million that we acquired in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

income before income taxes in 2012 increased over 2011 by 127 or 343 million to 3048 million however that net increase of 343 million includes 442 million of income before income taxes related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore income before income taxes from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2012 and 2011 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 100 million the net decrease of 100 million related primarily to 1 54 million from a change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 2 19 million of increased interest expense related to the arrowhead acquisition 3 17 million in increased noncash stockbased compensation primarily due to new grants issued and 4 68 million earned by our retail division commissioned producers as a result of a special onetime bonus program for those whose 2012 production exceeded their 2011 production by at least 5 therefore excluding these items income before income taxes from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2012 and 2011 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by only 58 million 

acquisitions 

approximately 37500 independent insurance agencies are estimated to be operating currently in the united states part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through 2012 we acquired 440 insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts 

  

a summary of our acquisitions over the last three years is as follows in millions except for number of acquisitions 

 

 on january 9 2012 we completed the acquisition of arrowhead pursuant to a merger agreement dated december 15 2011 the “merger agreement” under the merger agreement the total cash purchase price of 3950 million is subject to adjustments for options to purchase shares of arrowhead’s common stock working capital sharing of net operating tax losses arrowhead’s preferred stock units transaction expenses and closing debt in addition within 60 days following the third anniversary of the acquisition’s closing date we will pay to certain persons who were arrowhead equityholders as of the closing date additional earnout payments equal collectively to 50 million subject to certain adjustments based on the “cumulative ebitda” of arrowhead and all of its subsidiaries as calculated pursuant to the merger agreement during the final year of the threeyear period following the acquisition’s closing date 

arrowhead is a national insurance program manager and one of the largest managing general agents “mgas” in the property and casualty insurance industry 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1—summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later commission revenues related to installment billings at the company’s subsidiary arrowhead are recorded on the later of the effective date of the policy or the first installment billing at those dates the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification from insurance companies concerning matters necessitating such adjustments from insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received from insurance companies or when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

  

acquisition purchase prices are typically based on a multiple of average annual operating profit earned over a oneto threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables “ebitdac” 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and assesses the recoverability of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2012 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets additionally there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options and nonvested stock awards to our employees and the related compensation expense is required to be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

litigation claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

 commissions and fees 

commissions and fees including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs increased 1831 million or 182 in 2012 profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs decreased 24 million or 44 in 2012 to 528 million due primarily to 41 million and 12 million reductions in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in our retail and wholesale brokerage divisions respectively but these reductions were partially offset by a 32 million increase in our national programs division core commissions and fees revenue increased 1856 million on a net basis of which approximately 1714 million represented core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2011 after taking into account divested business of 107 million the remaining net increase of 249 million representing net new business reflects a 26 internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees 

commissions and fees revenue including profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs increased 40 in 2011 profitsharing contingent commissions decreased 115 million to 432 million in 2011 with the decrease primarily due to reductions in amounts paid to offices in our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions core organic commissions and fees revenue decreased 24 in 2011 the 2011 decrease of 24 represents 215 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 212 million was attributable to our retail division the remaining 03 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue related to a 45 million reduction in our national programs division which was partially offset by a 36 million increase in our wholesale brokerage division and a 06 million increase in our services division the declines in profitsharing contingent commissions and core organic commissions and fees during 2011 were more than offset by the addition of 776 million of core commissions and fees revenue from acquired operations 

  

investment income 

investment income decreased to 08 million in 2012 compared with 13 million in 2011 mainly due to lower average daily invested balances in 2012 than in 2011 investment income of 13 million in 2011 was effectively flat as compared with 2010 even though the average daily invested balance in 2011 was higher in 2010 the lower income yields negated any income growth 

other income net 

other income for 2012 reflected income of 102 million compared with 63 million in 2011 and 52 million in 2010 we recognized gains of 43 million 23 million and 12 million from sales of books of business customer accounts in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively although we are not in the business of selling books of business we periodically will sell an office or a book of business because it does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or for other reasons related to the particular assets in question other income also included 36 million 13 million and 23 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively paid to us in connection with settlements of litigation against former employees for violation of restrictive covenants contained in their employment agreements with us additionally we recognized nonrecurring gains rental income and sales of software services of 23 million 23 million and 09 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased on a net basis approximately 196 or 998 million in 2012 however that net increase included 809 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2012 and 2011 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 189 million the employee compensation and benefit increases from these offices were primarily related to increases in staff and management salaries of 32 million new salaried producers of 13 million profit center bonuses of 14 million health insurance costs of 18 million employee 401kprofitsharing contributions of 07 million and bonus incentives of 81 million primarily due to 68 million earned by our retail division commissioned producers as a result of a special onetime bonus program for those whose 2012 production exceeded their 2011 production by at least 5 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased on a net basis approximately 43 or 209 million in 2011 however that net increase included 278 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2011 and 2010 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 69 million the employee compensation and benefit reductions from these offices were primarily related to reductions in staff and management salaries of 68 million and reductions in commissions paid to producers of 28 million the aggregate of which was partially offset by an increase in bonuses of 27 million 

employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues increased in 2012 to 507 as compared to 502 for 2011 and 501 for 2010 we had 6438 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2012 compared with 5557 at december 31 2011 and 5286 at december 31 2010 of the net increase of 881 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2012 over the prior yearend an increase of 759 was attributable to acquisitions thus reflecting a net increase of 122 employees in the offices existing at both yearends 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we have an employee stock purchase plan and grant stock options and nonvested stock awards to our employees compensation expense for all sharebased awards is recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards for 2012 2011 and 2010 the noncash stockbased compensation expense incorporates the costs related to each of our four stockbased plans as explained in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

noncash stockbased compensation increased 417 or 47 million in 2012 as a result of new grants under our stock incentive plan “sip” that will vest in four to ten years subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria by grantees and the achievement of consolidated earnings per share growth at certain levels by us over threeto fiveyear measurement periods 

noncash stockbased compensation increased 635 or 43 million in 2011 as a result of new grants under our sip that will vest in six to ten years subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria by grantees and the achievement of consolidated eps growth at certain levels by us over a fiveyear measurement period ending december 31 2015 

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 145 in 2012 142 in 2011 and 140 in 2010 other operating expenses in 2012 increased 303 million over 2011 of which 333 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses attributable to offices that existed in the same periods in both 2012 and 2011 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 30 million of the 30 million decrease 27 million 

  

related to reductions in office rents and related expenses 22 million related to a reduction in legal expenses and 20 million related to lower insurance costs these cost savings were partially offset by increases of 13 million in consulting and inspection services 11 million for litigation reserves and 10 million in employee sales meetings 

other operating expenses in 2011 increased 82 million over 2010 of which 100 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses attributable to offices that existed in the same periods in both 2011 and 2010 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 18 million of the 18 million decrease 24 million related to reductions in office rents and related expenses and 19 million related to lower insurance costs these cost savings were partially offset by a 26 million increase in legal costs which was primarily related to the enforcement of restrictive covenants contained in our employment agreements with former employees 

amortization 

amortization expense increased 88 million or 161 in 2012 and 33 million or 64 in 2011 the increases in 2012 and 2011 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation increased 241 in 2012 and decreased 20 in 2011 the increase in 2012 was due primarily to the addition of fixed assets as a result of recent acquisitions the decrease in 2011 was the result of certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 20 million or 139 in 2012 and decreased 03 million or 23 in 2011 the 2012 increase was due primarily to the additional debt borrowed in connection with our acquisition of arrowhead and the 2011 decrease was due primarily to loan principal reductions 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805— business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair values of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years 

the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2012 the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows in thousands 

 

 the fair values of the estimated earnout payables were reduced in 2012 2011 and 2010 since certain acquisitions did not perform at the level estimated based on our original projections an acquisition is considered to be performing well if its operating profit exceeds the level needed to reach the minimum purchase price however a reduction in the estimated acquisition earnout payable can occur even though the acquisition is performing well if it is not performing at the level contemplated by our original estimate 

as of december 31 2012 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 52987000 of which 10164000 was recorded as accounts payable and 42823000 was recorded as other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2011 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 47715000 of which 3654000 was recorded as accounts payable and 44061000 was recorded as other noncurrent liability 

  

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 396 in 2012 394 in 2011 and 392 in 2010 the higher effective annual tax rates are primarily the result of higher average effective state income tax rates 

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments or divisions the retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses result from completed acquisitions within a given division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management emphasizes the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in contrast the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newlyacquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period core organic commissions and fees attempts to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates the net changes in each of these three components can be determined for each of our customers however because our agency management accounting systems do not aggregate such data it is not reportable core organic commissions and fees reflect either “positive” growth with a net increase in revenues or “negative” growth with a net decrease in revenues 

the internal growth rates for our core organic commissions and fees for the three years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 by division are as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 is as follows in thousands

retail division 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 957 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions net of related compensation which we receive will be reflected in our pretax income

 the retail division’s total revenues in 2012 increased 61 or 372 million over the same period in 2011 to 6444 million profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2012 decreased 41 million or 172 from 2011 to 197 million primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance companies in 2011 and to the fact that two national insurance carriers who provided us gsc contracts in 2011 changed to profitsharing contingency contracts in 2012 the 389 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 387 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2011 ii a decrease of 85 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2011 from business divested or transferred to the wholesale brokerage division during 2012 and iii the remaining net increase of 87 million primarily related to net new business the retail division’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 15 for 2012 and resulted primarily from stabilizing insurable exposure units with slightly stronger upward pressure on general insurance premium rates 

income before income taxes for 2012 increased 54 or 74 million over the same period in 2011 to 1452 million included in the 74 million net increase in income before income taxes is another 74 million net expense increase in change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and a 03 million net expense increase from amortization depreciation and intercompany interest changes excluding these items and the 41 million decrease in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs income before income taxes for 2012 increased 192 million over 2011 of which 87 million originated from new acquisitions that were standalone operations and 105 million was generated by offices in existence in both 2011 and 2012 of the 105 million increase from existing offices 87 million 14 million of foldin acquired revenues was attributed to organic growth of core commissions and fees 56 million cost savings from other operating expenses 05 reduction in noncash stockbased compensation but illegible offset by 49 million increase in compensation and employee benefits the 49 million net increase in compensation and employee benefits was primarily due to the onetime producer bonuses of 68 million paid to commissioned producers whose 2012 production exceeded their 2011 production by at least five percent which was partially offset by a reduction of approximately 20 million less staff salaries the 56 million reduction in other operating expenses was primarily related to reductions in occupancyoffice rents legal and claims settlements insurance expense and data processing costs 

  

the retail division’s total revenues in 2011 increased 56 or 321 million over the same period in 2010 to 6072 million profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2011 decreased 21 million or 80 from 2010 primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance companies in 2010 and less premiums written as a result of the slowing us economy the 332 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 575 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2010 ii a decrease of 37 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2010 from business divested during 2011 iii a decrease of 04 million for business transferred to our wholesale brokerage division and iv a net decrease of 212 million primarily attributable to net lost business the retail division’s negative growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 39 for 2011 and resulted primarily from lower property insurance rates and reduced insurable exposure units in most areas of the united states however as of the end of 2011 there were indications that exposure units’ rates of decline were slowing and some property insurance rates were beginning to increase slightly 

income before income taxes for 2011 increased 76 or 98 million over the same period in 2010 to 1378 million the increase was mainly due to the profitability of our new acquisitions and general cost savings that partially offset the decline in core organic commissions and fees of the 98 million net increase in income before income taxes 37 million resulted from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables partially offsetting the 212 million reduction in core organic commissions and fees were reductions of approximately 99 million in compensation expense and 63 million in other operating expenses led by lower rent and insurance costs 

national programs division 

the national programs division provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups public and quasipublic entities and market niches like the retail division and the wholesale brokerage division the national programs division’s revenues are primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

   

the national programs division’s total revenues in 2012 increased 885 million to 2529 million a 538 increase over 2011 profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2012 increased 32 million over 2011 due primarily to profitsharing contingent commissions earned at our arrowhead operation of the 844 million net increase in core commissions and fees for national programs i an increase of approximately 833 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2011 and ii a net increase of 11 million was primarily related to net new business therefore the national programs division’s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 08 for 2012 of the 11 million of net new business 22 million related to a net increase in commissions and fees revenue at proctor financial inc “proctor” which was partially offset by 17 million of net lost business in our facultative reinsurance facility and the remaining 06 million of net new business was generated by various other programs 

income before income taxes for 2012 decreased 148 or 90 million from the same period in 2011 to 515 million this net decrease was due to i a reduction of 56 million from the offices that existed in both 2012 and 2011 primarily as a result of reduced profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs of 13 million and increased compensation expense mainly related to increased staffing levels at proctor ii loss before income taxes and change in estimated acquisition earnout payables of 48 million related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices primarily the arrowhead acquisition and iii a 14 million income credit generated from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables income before income taxes and intercompany interest expense related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices primarily the arrowhead acquisition that had no comparable earnings in the same period of 2011 was approximately 217 million for 2012 however those earnings were offset by 250 million of intercompany interest expense allocation 

the national programs division’s total revenues in 2011 decreased 116 million or 66 to 1644 million from 2010 profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2011 decreased 80 million from 2010 of which 29 million related to our condominium program at florida intracoastal underwriters limited company “fiu” and 44 million related to proctor the decrease in fiu’s profitsharing contingent commissions in 2011 was principally attributable to fact that in 2010 fiu received a higher amount of profitsharing contingent commissions because they included a delayed 2009 payment proctor’s decreased profitsharing contingent commissions were the direct result of the lower premiums generated by proctor in 2010 of the 34 million net decrease in core commissions and fees for national programs i an increase of approximately 11 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2010 and ii a net decrease of 45 million was primarily related to net lost business therefore the national programs division’s negative growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 30 for 2011 of the 45 million of net lost business 44 million related to proctor and was primarily the result of its loss of a large customer 15 million related to our calsurance ® operations and 11 million related to fiu all of which was partially offset by a 13 million increase related to our public entity business and a 12 million net aggregate increase attributable to the other programs in the division 

income before income taxes for 2011 decreased 139 or 98 million from the same period in 2010 to 605 million this decrease was primarily driven by the reductions in profitsharing contingent commissions noncash stock grant compensation increased 06 million due to new sip grants made in the first quarter of 2011 and other operating expenses increased 01 million additionally interest expense of this division relating to prior acquisitions decreased by 13 million primarily due to the 10 annual reduction in the cost of capital interest rate charged against the total purchase price of each of the division’s prior acquisitions

income before income taxes for 2012 increased 187 or 68 million over the same period in 2011 to 434 million primarily due to a net reduction in the intercompany interest expense allocation of 35 million additionally while total revenues increased by 94 million employee compensation and benefits cost increased 43 million and other operating expenses increased by 21 million employee compensation and benefit expense increased primarily due to higher bonus expense as a result of the division’s increased profitability and 12 million in new producer salaries other operating expenses increased as a result of higher costs for data processing telephone and intercompany overhead charges 

the wholesale brokerage division’s total revenues in 2011 increased 23 million over 2010 of which 53 million resulting from an increase in core commissions and fees revenue was partially offset by a 29 million reduction in profitsharing contingent commissions and gscs of the 53 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue i an increase of approximately 12 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2010 ii a decrease of 04 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2010 for business divested during 2011 and iii the remaining net increase of 37 million primarily related to net new business as such the wholesale brokerage division’s 

  

core organic commissions and fees revenue for 2011 was 24 the positive internal growth rate in 2011 compared with the negative growth rate in 2010 reflected the gradual stabilization of coastal property insurance rates and the fact that excess and surplus lines insurance products continued to be competitive with the products of admitted carriers including the citizens property insurance corporation in florida

on january 9 2012 we entered into 1 an amended and restated revolving and term loan credit agreement the “suntrust agreement” with suntrust bank “suntrust” that provides for a a 1000 million term loan the “suntrust term loan” and b a 500 million revolving line of credit the “suntrust revolver” and 2 a 500 million promissory note the “jpm note” in favor of jpmorgan chase bank na “jpmorgan” pursuant to a letter agreement executed by jp morgan together with the jpm note the “jpm agreement” that provides for a 500 million uncommitted line of credit bridge facility the “jpm bridge facility” the suntrust term loan the suntrust revolver and the jpm bridge facility were each funded on january 9 2012 and provided the financing for the arrowhead acquisition the suntrust agreement amended and restated the prior loan agreement 

the maturity date for the suntrust term loan and the suntrust revolver is december 31 2016 at which time all outstanding principal and unpaid interest will be due both the suntrust term loan and the suntrust revolver may be increased by up to 500 million bringing the total available to 1500 million for the suntrust term loan and 1000 million for the suntrust revolver the calculation of interest and fees for the suntrust agreement is generally based on our funded debttoebitda ratio interest is charged at a rate equal to 100 to 140 above libor or 100 below the base rate each as more fully described in the suntrust agreement fees include an upfront fee an availability fee of 0175 to 025 and a letter of credit margin fee of 100 to 140 the obligations under the suntrust term loan and suntrust revolver are unsecured and the suntrust agreement includes various covenants limitations and events of default that are customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers and that are substantially similar to those contained in the prior loan agreement   

the maturity date for the jpm bridge facility was february 3 2012 at which time all outstanding principal and unpaid interest would have been due on january 26 2012 we entered into a term loan agreement the “jpm agreement” with jpmorgan that provided for a 1000 million term loan the “jpm term loan” the jpm term loan was fully funded on january 26 2012 and provided the financing to fully repay 1 the jpm bridge facility and 2 the suntrust revolver as a result of the january 26 2012 financing and repayments the jpm bridge facility was terminated and the suntrust revolver’s amount outstanding was reduced to zero

the 30day libor and adjusted libor rate as of december 31 2012 were 023 and 025 respectively 

the notes the master agreement the suntrust agreement and the jpm agreement all require that we maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2012 and 2011 

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our master agreement and the suntrust agreement and the jpm agreement described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2013 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototalcapitalization ratio we would be able to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line and term loan agreements 

our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments availableforsale equity securities equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments and certificates of deposit at december 31 2012 and 2011 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2012 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 management’s report on internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 is incorporated herein at item 8 deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 which is incorporated herein at item 8 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and by fees paid by customers for certain services commissions are usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases we share commissions with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “profitsharing contingent commission” which is a profitsharing commission based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services and social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers the amount of our revenues from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels

 arrowhead acquisition 

on january 9 2012 we completed the acquisition of arrowhead general insurance agency inc “arrowhead” a national insurance program manager and one of the largest managing general agents “mga” in the property and casualty insurance industry pursuant to a merger agreement dated december 15 2011 the “merger agreement” under the merger agreement the total cash purchase price of 3950 million is subject to adjustments for options to purchase shares of arrowhead’s common stock working capital sharing of net operating tax losses arrowhead’s preferred stock units transaction expenses and closing debt in addition within 60 days following the third anniversary of the acquisition’s closing date we will pay to certain persons who were arrowhead equityholders as of the closing date additional earnout payments equal collectively to 50 million subject to certain adjustments based on the” cumulative ebitda” of arrowhead and all of its subsidiaries as calculated under the merger agreement during the final year of the threeyear period following the acquisition’s closing date 

industry overview 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting riskbearing industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the 

  

dampening effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 premium rates generally increased beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 

during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by insurance companies from these hurricanes insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states insurance premium rates generally declined during 2006 

in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in florida as discussed below insurance premium rates continued to decline from 2007 through 2011 in most of the other us regions during 2007 and 2008 the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent in nevada arizona and florida was hit especially hard we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment the revenues from this operation were significantly and negatively impacted during 2007 through 2009 by these national economic trends and by 2010 these revenues were insignificant 

although insurance premium rates declined from 2008 through 2011 in most lines of coverage the rates of decline appeared to be slowing however during the second half of 2008 and all of 2009 insurable exposure units such as sales and payroll expenditures declined significantly due to the weakening economy primarily in the southeastern and western parts of the united states since 2008 declining exposure units continued to have a greater adverse impact on our commissions and fees revenue than did declining insurance premium rates general insurance premium rates are expected to modestly and gradually increase during 2012 even though exposure units do not seem to be declining at the same pace as they were in the beginning of 2011 we do not expect any significant growth in exposure units in 2012 

segment information 

our business is divided into four reportable operating segments 1 the retail division 2 the national programs division 3 the wholesale brokerage division and 4 the services division the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public entity professional and individual customers the national programs division contains two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals and special programs which markets targeted products and services to specific industries trade groups public entities and market niches the wholesale brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal insurance and reinsurance primarily through independent agents and brokers the services division provides customers with thirdparty claims administration consulting for the workers’ compensation insurance market comprehensive medical utilization management services in both workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services and social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services 

the following table summarizes 1 the commissions and fees revenue generated by each of our reportable operating segments for 2011 2010 and 2009 and 2 the percentage of our total commissions and fees revenue represented by each segment for each such period 

 

 we conduct all of our operations within the united states of america except for one wholesale brokerage operation based in london england that commenced business in march 2008 this operation earned 91 million 99 million and 66 million of revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we do not have any material foreign longlived assets 

see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional segment financial data relating to our business 

  

retail division

in connection with the selling and marketing of insurance coverages we provide a broad range of related services to our customers such as risk management and loss control surveys and analysis consultation in connection with placing insurance coverages and claims processing we believe these services are important factors in securing and retaining customers 

national programs division 

as of december 31 2011 our national programs division employed 860 persons our national programs division consists of two units professional programs and special programs 

professional programs professional programs provides professional liability and related package insurance products for certain professionals professional programs tailors insurance products to the needs of a particular professional group negotiates policy forms coverages and commission rates with an insurance company and in certain cases secures the formal or informal endorsement of the product by a professional association or sponsoring company professional groups that professional programs service include dentists lawyers accountants optometrists opticians insurance agents financial service representatives benefit administrators real estate brokers real estate title agents and escrow agents the professional protector plan ® for dentists and the lawyer’s protector plan ® are marketed and sold primarily through a national network of independent agencies including certain of our retail offices however certain professional liability programs calsurance ® and titlepac ®  are principally marketed and sold directly to our insured customers under our agency agreements with the insurance companies that underwrite these programs we often have authority to bind coverages subject to established guidelines to bill and collect premiums and in some cases to adjust claims for the programs that we market through independent agencies we receive a wholesale commission or “override” which is then shared with these independent agencies 

below are brief descriptions of the programs offered to professional groups by the professional programs unit of the national programs division 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 special programs  special programs markets targeted products and services to specific industries trade groups public and quasipublic entities and market niches most of these products and services are marketed and sold primarily through independent agents 

  

including certain of our retail offices however a number of these products and services are also marketed and sold directly to insured customers under agency agreements with the insurance companies that underwrite these programs we often have authority to bind coverages subject to established guidelines to bill and collect premiums and in some cases to adjust claims

 all of arrowhead’s operations except for the claims operations will report under national programs 

wholesale brokerage division 

at december 31 2011 our wholesale brokerage division employed 832 persons our wholesale brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance products and services to retail insurance agencies including our retail offices and reinsurance products and services to insurance companies throughout the united states the wholesale brokerage division offices represent various us and uk surplus lines insurance companies additionally certain offices are also lloyd’s of london correspondents the wholesale brokerage division also represents admitted insurance companies for purposes of affording access to such companies for smaller agencies that otherwise do not have access to large insurance company representation excess and surplus insurance products encompass many insurance coverages including personal lines homeowners yachts jewelry commercial property and casualty commercial automobile garage restaurant builder’s risk and inland marine lines difficulttoinsure general 

  

liability and products liability coverages are a specialty as is excess workers’ compensation coverage wholesale brokers solicit business through mailings and direct contact with retail agency representatives during 2011 commissions and fees from our largest wholesale brokerage division customer represented approximately 11 of the wholesale brokerage division’s total commissions and fees revenue 

services division 

at december 31 2011 our services division employed 465 persons and provided a widerange of insurancerelated services 

below are brief descriptions of the programs offered by the services division 

 

  

  

  

  

 in 2011 our three largest workers’ compensation contracts represented approximately 158 of our services division’s fees revenues or approximately 10 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue 

employees 

at december 31 2011 we had 5557 fulltime equivalent employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their ability to solicit business from our customers or to hire our employees for a period of time after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere particularly outside of florida 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct sales efforts have had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially rather than individually oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

  

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors tableend we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

we are primarily engaged in the insurance agency wholesale brokerage and insurance programs business and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

  

current us economic conditions and the shift away from traditional insurance markets may continue to adversly affect our business 

since late 2007 global consumer confidence has eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values potential inflation volatility in energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit high unemployment and the stability and solvency of financial institutions financial markets businesses and sovereign nations these concerns have slowed economic growth and resulted in a recession in the united states economic conditions have had a negative impact on our results of operations during the years since 2008 due to reduced customer demand if these economic conditions continue or worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including further declines in values of insurable exposure units further declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of profitability as traditional insurance markets 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payable and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows given its large size relative to our prior acquisitions our recently completed arrowhead acquisition involve many of the risks identified above such as achieving anticipated levels of profitability the integration of arrowhead’s operations into ours the retention of arrowhead’s personnel the diversion of our management’s attention and unanticipated problems or legal difficulties 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

traditionally we have maintained cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic while we began in the fall of 2008 refocusing our investment and cash management strategy by moving more of our cash into noninterest bearing accounts which are fdicinsured until december 31 2012 but not subject to any limits and money market accounts a portion of which became fdic insured in the fall of 2008 we still maintain cash and investment balances in excess of the limits insured by fdic as the credit crisis persists the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the further disruption in the usbased credit markets and by further instability of financial systems 

the disruption in the usbased credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets over the past few years have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies these conditions include significant losses greater volatility significantly less liquidity widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets while these conditions have somewhat abated since the fall of 2008 it is difficult to predict when these conditions will completely end and the extent to which our markets products and business will be adversely affected 

the unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and limited access to capital and credit for many companies although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2016 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 

  

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited 

inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 

given the current macroeconomic environment it is possible that us government actions in the form of a monetary stimulus a fiscal stimulus or both to the us economy could lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base resulting in an increase in our employee compensation and benefits and our other operating expenses this could harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation on our cost base 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2011 fiscal year we have 1323469000 of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2011 and determined that the fair value of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets substantially exceed the carrying value of such assets a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see notes 1 – “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 – “goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities as disclosed in prior years certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the company has not chosen to discontinue receiving profitsharing contingent commissions or override commissions the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while we cannot predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations further if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions it would likely adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 52 of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 50 of our total commissions and fees revenue was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 50 and 50 respectively of our total commissions were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies should either of these insurance companies seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result no other insurance company accounts for 50 or more of our total commissions and fees 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida georgia indiana massachusetts michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida georgia indiana massachusetts michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we derived 7657 million or 761 7390 million or 764 and 7393 million or 766 of our commissions and fees respectively from our operations located in these states we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to customers in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have expanded our operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

in 2008 we expanded our operations to the united kingdom this was the first time we have opened an office outside the united states in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or customers are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

  

profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year these commissions generally have accounted for 44 to 57 of our previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that may be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report results to carriers an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology 

  

telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

we are taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

we are subject to litigation which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are and may be subject to a number of claims regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome of these claims actions and proceedings with certainty 

an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services as previously disclosed j powell brown our president and chief executive officer took a temporary leave of absence for health reasons effective january 29 2012 and certain of 

  

our former executive officers ceased employment with us during the past two years while they are prohibited from soliciting our employees and customers they are not prohibited from competing with us on march 1 2011 a press release was issued by a private equity firm announcing that it had entered into a partnership with two of our former executive officers jim w henderson former vice chairman and chief operating officer who retired from the company in august 2010 and thomas e riley former regional president and chief acquisitions officer whose employment with the company ceased in january 2011 to form a company that would focus on building a middle market insurance brokerage firm and that it planned to invest up to 250 million of equity capital to support the company’s strategy through acquisitions and organic growth 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current customers merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the overall amount of work that we perform for these customers if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that customer or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

healthcare reform and increased costs of current employees’ medical and other benefits could have a materially adverse affect on our business 

our profitability is affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of economic factors beyond our control although we have actively sought to contain increases in these costs there can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

in addition we believe that increased health care costs resulting from the 2010 health care reform bill could have a material adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events 

our operations may be subject to natural disasters or other business disruptions which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes including in florida where our headquarters are located earthquakes including california where we maintain a relatively large number of offices including those acquired in the arrowhead transaction power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2011 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 187 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his family members which include his son powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 169 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

changes in laws and regulations may increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended “sarbanesoxley” and the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 have required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of these acts the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated and will continue to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs while these costs are no longer increasing they may in fact increase in the future these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage likewise these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

  

from time to time new regulations are enacted or existing requirements are changed and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted for example as global warming issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on global warming may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 and future yearends as required by section 404 of sarbanesoxley investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 

as directed by section 404 of sarbanesoxley the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements however if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenues are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a continuing general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 

we foster a strong decentralized sales culture with a goal of consistent sustained growth over the long term as of january 2012 our senior leadership group included eight executive officers with regional responsibility for oversight of designated operations within the company and four regional vice presidents in our retail division that report directly to one of our executive officers in february 2011 anthony m grippa thomas keith huval and richard a knudson jr were promoted to be regional vice presidents in april 2011 nick dereszynski was also promoted to be a regional vice president additionally in january 2012 anthony strianese was promoted to be a regional president and chris l walker was promoted to be a regional executive vice president 

we increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2008 in 2009 our revenues dropped to 9679 million then increased 06 to 9735 million and 41 to 1014 billion in 2010 and 2011 respectively our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 1014 billion in 2011 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 140 in the same period we increased net income from 80 million to 1640 million in 2011 a compound annual growth rate of 183 

the past five years have posed significant challenges for us and for our industry in the form of a prevailing decline in insurance premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” increased significant governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace since 2007 resulting in a substantial loss of revenues for us and beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2011 increased pressure on the values of insurable exposure units as the consequence of the general weakening of the economy in the united states 

from the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 we experienced negative internal revenue growth each quarter this was due primarily to the “soft market” and beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2011 the decline in insurable exposure units which further reduced our commissions and fees revenue part of the decline in 2007 was the result of the increased governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace as described below in “the florida insurance overview” one industry segment that was hit especially hard during these years was the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent in nevada arizona and florida we had a wholesale brokerage operation that focused on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment the revenues from this operation were significantly adversely impacted during 2007 through 2009 by these national economic trends and by 2010 these revenues were insignificant 

while insurance premium rates continued to decline for most lines of coverage during 2011 the rate of decline slowed and in some cases increased for certain lines of coverages such as coastal property for the first time in the last five years we are observing some upward pressure on general insurance premium rates for 2012 we believe that there may be a modest and gradual increase in many insurance premium rates 

in 2010 and 2011 continued declining exposure units had a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than declining insurance premium rates although we do not anticipate any significant increases in exposure units during 2012 we believe that the 2012 decline will be less than recent years and this lack of decline may enable us to begin to experience positive internal growth of our commissions and fees revenue at some point in 2012 even though our negative internal growth of our commissions and fees revenue improved over each sequential quarter for the third and fourth quarters of 2011 we do not believe that trend will necessarily continue in the first half of 2012 due to persisting inconsistencies in the insurance premium rate environment 

  

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 50 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are typically included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in contrast the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by a newly acquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period core organic commissions and fees attempts to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes from i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates the net changes in each of these three components can be determined for each of our customers however because our agency management accounting systems do not aggregate such data it is not reportable core organic commissions and fees can reflect either “positive” growth with a net increase in revenues or “negative” with a net decrease in revenues 

in recent years five national insurance companies have replaced the lossratio based profitsharing contingent commission calculation with a guaranteed fixedbase methodology referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” since these gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written as of december 31 2011 we accrued and earned 121 million from gscs during 2011 most of which will be collected in the first quarter of 2012 for the twelvemonth periods ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we earned 134 million and 159 million respectively from gscs 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services and social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies these services are provided over a period of time typically one year fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 164 in 2011 146 in 2010 and 133 in 2009 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities as a result of the bank liquidity and solvency issues in the united states in the last quarter of 2008 we moved substantial amounts of our cash into noninterest bearing checking accounts so that they would be fully insured by the federal depository insurance corporation “fdic” or into moneymarket investment funds a portion of which is fdic insured of suntrust and wells fargo two large national banks investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 

florida insurance overview 

many states have established “residual markets” which are governmental or quasigovernmental insurance facilities that provide coverage to individuals andor businesses that cannot buy insurance in the private marketplace ie “insurers of last resort” these facilities can be designed to cover any type of risk or exposure however the exposures most commonly subject to such facilities are automobile or highrisk property exposures residual markets can also be referred to as fair plans windstorm pools joint underwriting associations or may even be given names styled after the private sector like “citizens property insurance corporation” in florida 

in august 2002 the florida legislature created “citizens property insurance corporation” “citizens” to be the “insurer of last resort” in florida initially citizens charged insurance rates that were higher than those generally prevailing in the private insurance marketplace in each of 2004 and 2005 four major hurricanes made landfall in florida as a result of the ensuing significant insurance property losses florida property insurance rates increased in 2006 to counter the higher property insurance rates the state of florida instructed citizens to significantly reduce its property insurance rates beginning in january 2007 by state law citizens guaranteed these rates through january 1 2010 as a result citizens became one of the most if not the most competitive riskbearers for a large percentage of florida’s commercial habitational coastal property exposures such as condominiums apartments and certain assisted living facilities additionally citizens became the only insurance market for certain homeowner policies throughout florida today citizens is one of the largest underwriters of coastal property exposures in florida 

  

in 2007 citizens became the principal direct competitor of the insurance companies that underwrite the condominium program administered by one of our indirect subsidiaries florida intracoastal underwriters limited company “fiu” and the excess and surplus lines insurers represented by wholesale brokers such as hull  company inc another of our subsidiaries consequently these operations lost significant amounts of revenues to citizens from 2008 through 2011 citizens’ impact was not as dramatic as it had been in 2007 fiu’s core commissions and fees decreased 168 during this 2008 to 2011 period citizens continued to be competitive against the excess and surplus lines insurers and therefore citizens negatively affected the revenues of our floridabased wholesale brokerage operations such as hull  company inc from 2007 through 2011 although the impact has been decreasing each year 

citizens’ impact on our florida retail division was less severe than on our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions because our retail offices have the ability to place business with citizens although at slightly lower commission rates and with greater difficulty than is the case with other insurance companies 

effective january 1 2010 citizens raised its insurance rates on average 10 for properties with values of less than 10 million and more than 10 for properties with values in excess of 10 million citizens raised its insurance rates again in 2011 and is expected to continue to increase its insurance rates in 2012 our commission revenues from citizens for 2011 2010 and 2009 were approximately 78 million 83 million and 87 million respectively if as expected citizens continues to attempt to reduce its insured exposures the financial impact of citizens on our business should continue to be reduced in 2012 

current year company overview 

for the fifth consecutive year we experienced negative internal growth of our commissions and fees revenue as a direct result of the general weakness of the economy since the second half of 2008 and the continuing “soft market” our core organic commissions and fees revenue which excludes the effect of recent acquisitions profitsharing contingencies and sales of books of business over the last twelve months reflects a negative internal growth rate of 26 or 233 million of net lost revenues the net lost revenues of 233 million is a significant improvement from the comparable net lost revenues of 427 million and 465 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively this improvement is principally attributable to the slowing of the rates of decline in both exposure units and insurance premium rates 

even though we continue to experience negative growth in our core organic commissions and fees we have succeeded in acquiring insurance operations that we believe are incrementally higher quality in each of the last three years we completed 38 acquisitions in 2011 which represents an increase over the 33 and 11 acquisitions made in 2010 and 2009 respectively the estimated annualized revenues from the 2011 acquisitions were 887 million which is up from the 706 million and 265 million that we acquired in 2010 and 2009 respectively in fact total revenues in 2011 increased 41 over 2010 due to the revenues from new acquisitions and the increase in other income the trend of increased acquisitions over the last three years continues into 2012 with our acquisition of arrowhead which is a national insurance program manager and one of the largest managing general agents “mga” in the property and casualty insurance industry with estimated 2011 revenues of approximately 1075 million 

income before income taxes in 2011 increased over 2010 by 17 or 44 million to 2705 million however that net increase of 44 million includes 144 million of income before income taxes related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore income before income taxes from those offices that existed in same time periods of 2011 and 2010 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by only 99 million this net decrease of 99 million reflects 168 million of reduced total revenues but offset by 69 million of continued cost savings and broadbased operational efficiencies additionally 42 million of the net 99 million decrease in income before income taxes from those offices that existed in same periods of 2011 and 2010 was due to the increased noncash stockbased compensation which related to new grants under our stock incentive plan “sip” that will vest in six to ten years subject to grantees achievement of certain performance criteria and the achievement of consolidated eps growth at certain levels by us over a fiveyear measurement period ending december 31 2015 

acquisitions 

approximately 37500 independent insurance agencies are estimated to be operating currently in the united states part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through 2011 we acquired 420 insurance intermediary operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts acquisition activity slowed in 2009 in part because potential sellers were unhappy with reduced agency valuations that were the consequence of lower revenues and operating profits due to the continuing “soft market” and decreasing exposure units and therefore opted to defer the sales of their insurance agencies the economic outlook in 2011 and 2010 improved slightly over 2009 and as a result certain sellers viewed 2011 and 2010 as a better time in which to join our organization and consequently we were able to close a greater number of acquisitions 

  

a summary of our acquisitions over the last three years is as follows in millions except for number of acquisitions 

 

 on january 9 2012 we completed the acquisition of arrowhead pursuant to a merger agreement dated december 15 2011 the “merger agreement” under the merger agreement the total cash purchase price of 3950 million is subject to adjustments for options to purchase shares of arrowhead’s common stock working capital sharing of net operating tax losses arrowhead’s preferred stock units transaction expenses and closing debt in addition within 60 days following the third anniversary of the acquisition’s closing date we will pay to certain persons who were arrowhead equityholders as of the closing date additional earnout payments equal collectively to 50 million subject to certain adjustments based on the “cumulative ebitda” of arrowhead and all of its subsidiaries as calculated under the merger agreement during the final year of the threeyear period following the acquisition’s closing date 

arrowhead is a national insurance program manager and one of the largest managing general agents “mgas” in the property and casualty insurance industry 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1—summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later at that date the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification concerning matters necessitating such adjustments from insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received from insurance companies or when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized 

  

acquisition purchase prices are typically based on a multiple of average annual operating profit earned over a one to threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase price for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these estimates are then discounted to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and assesses the recoverability of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2011 and determined that the fair value of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets substantially exceeds the carrying value of such assets 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we grant stock options and nonvested stock awards to our employees and the related compensation expense is required to be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

litigation claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 commissions and fees 

commissions and fees revenue including profitsharing contingent commissions increased 40 in 2011 and 02 in 2010 but decreased 01 in 2009 profitsharing contingent commissions decreased 115 million to 432 million in 2011 with the decrease primarily due to reductions in amounts paid to offices in our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions core organic commissions and fees revenue decreased 26 in 2011 47 in 2010 and 51 in 2009 the 2011 decrease of 26 represents 233 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 230 million was attributable to our retail division the remaining 03 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue related to 27 million reduction in our national programs division which was partially offset by 19 million growth in our wholesale brokerage division and 06 million growth in our services division the declines in profitsharing contingent commissions and core organic commissions and fees during 2011 were more than offset by the addition of 782 million of core commission and fee revenues from acquired operations 

in 2010 commissions and fees revenue including profitsharing contingent commissions increased 02 or 21 million over 2009 profitsharing contingent commissions increased 71 million to 547 million in 2010 with the increase primarily due to the performance of our national programs division the 2010 decrease of 47 in core organic commissions and fees revenue represents 427 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 76 million was attributable to retail wholesale brokerage and services operations based in florida while 218 million related to nonflorida retail wholesale brokerage and services operations the remaining 133 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue related to our national programs division of which 107 million represented net lost business at proctor financial inc our subsidiary which provides lenderplaced insurance “proctor” the declines in core organic commissions and fees during 2010 were nearly offset by the addition of 392 million of core commission and fee revenues from acquired operations 

investment income 

investment income of 13 million in 2011 was effectively flat as compared with 2010 even though the average daily invested balance in 2011 was higher than 2010 the lower income yields negated any income growth investment income increased slightly to 13 million in 2010 compared with 12 million in 2009 mainly due to a higher average daily invested balance in 2010 than in 2009 

  

other income net 

other income for 2011 reflected income of 63 million compared with 52 million in 2010 and 19 million in 2009 we recognized gains of 23 million 12 million and 02 million from sales of books of business customer accounts in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively although we are not in the business of selling books of business we periodically will sell an office or a book of business because it does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or for other reasons related to the particular assets in question other income also included 13 million 23 million and 03 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively paid to us in connection with settlements of litigation against former employees for violation of restrictive covenants contained in their employment agreements with us additionally we recognized nonrecurring gains settlements and sales of software services of 23 million 09 million and 05 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased on a net basis approximately 43 or 209 million in 2011 however that net increase included 278 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2011 and 2010 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 69 million the employee compensation and benefit reductions from these offices were primarily related to reductions in staff and management salaries of 68 million and commissions paid to producers of 28 million the aggregate of which was partially offset by an increase in bonuses of 27 million 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased on a net basis approximately 06 or 31 million in 2010 however that net increase included 106 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in same time periods of 2010 and 2009 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 74 million the employee compensation and benefit reductions from these offices were primarily related to reductions in staff and management salaries and bonuses of 126 million offset by an increase in compensation of new producers of 32 million for new salaried producers and 08 million for new commissioned producers and an increase of 11 million in group health insurance costs 

employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly in 2011 to 502 as compared to 501 for both 2010 and 2009 we had 5557 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2011 compared with 5286 at december 31 2010 and 5206 at december 31 2009 of the net increase of 271 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2011 over the prior yearend an increase of 443 was attributable to acquisitions thus reflecting a net reduction of 172 employees in the offices existing at both yearends 

noncash stockbased compensation 

we have an employee stock purchase plan and grant stock options and nonvested stock awards to our employees compensation expense for all sharebased awards is recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards for 2011 2010 and 2009 the noncash stockbased compensation expense incorporates the costs related to each of our four stockbased plans as explained in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

noncash stockbased compensation increased 635 or 43 million in 2011 as a result of new grants under our stock incentive plan “sip” that will vest in six to ten years subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria by grantees and the achievement of consolidated eps growth at certain levels by us over a fiveyear measurement period ending december 31 2015 

noncash stockbased compensation decreased 70 or 05 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of headcount reductions 

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 142 in 2011 140 in 2010 and 148 in 2009 other operating expenses in 2011 increased 82 million from 2010 of which 100 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses attributable to offices that existed in the same periods in both 2011 and 2010 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 18 million of the 18 million decrease 24 million related to reductions in office rents and related expenses and 19 million related to lower insurance costs these cost savings were partially offset by a 26 million increase in legal costs primarily related to the enforcement of restrictive covenants contained in our employment agreements with former employees 

other operating expenses in 2010 decreased 75 million from 2009 of which 24 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses from those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2010 and 2009 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 99 million of the 99 million decrease 32 million related to reduced net legal fees 25 million related to reductions in office rent expense and the remaining 42 million related to broadbased reductions in to travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expenses supplies and postage and delivery expenses of the 32 million reduction in net legal fees 38 million related to a reimbursement by an insurance carrier of previously incurred legal costs 

  

amortization 

amortization expense increased 33 million or 64 in 2011 and 16 million or 32 in 2010 the increases in 2011 and 2010 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation decreased 20 in 2011 and 45 in 2010 the decreases in 2011 and 2010 were due primarily to certain fixed assets reaching their fully depreciated levels in those years 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 03 million or 23 in 2011 and 01 million or 09 in 2010 primarily as a result of principal reductions during those years 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805—business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair values of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities with only limited exceptions upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity additionally the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earnout purchase arrangements at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration as a result the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in these earnout obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred estimations of potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired entities usually for periods ranging from one to three years 

the net charge or credit to the condensed consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earnout payables balance and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earnout payables 

as of december 31 2011 the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs level 3 the resulting net changes as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earnout payables for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows in thousands 

 

 the fair values of the estimated acquisition earnout payables were reduced in 2011 and 2010 since certain acquisitions did not perform at the level that we had estimated based on our original projections an acquisition is considered to be performing well if its operating profit exceeds the level needed to reach the minimum purchase price however a reduction in the estimated acquisition earnout payable can occur even though the acquisition is performing well if it is not performing at the level contemplated by our original estimate 

as of december 31 2011 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 47715000 of which 3654000 was recorded as accounts payable and 44061000 was recorded as other noncurrent liability as of december 31 2010 the estimated acquisition earnout payables equaled 29609000 of which 7651000 was recorded as accounts payable and 21958000 was recorded as other noncurrent liability 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 394 in 2011 392 in 2010 and 398 in 2009 the lower effective annual tax rate in 2011 and 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily the result of lower average effective state income tax rates as a result of our stock acquisition of arrowhead in january 2012 as explained in note 16 – subsequent events and the reduced amount of taxdeductible amortization expense we believe that after giving effect to other expected 2012 changes and holding other potential variables constant our effective tax rate for the year ending december 31 2012 will approximate 410 

  

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments or divisions the retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses result from completed acquisitions within a given division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management emphasizes the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in contrast the term “core organic commissions and fees” is our core commissions and fees less i the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newly acquired operations and ii divested business core commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period core organic commissions and fees attempts to express the current year’s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year’s core commissions and fees the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to i net new and lost accounts ii net changes in our clients’ exposure units and iii net changes in insurance premium rates the net changes in each of these three components can be determined for each of our customers however because our agency management accounting systems do not aggregate such data it is not reportable core organic commissions and fees reflect either “positive” growth with a net increase in revenues or “negative” with a net decrease in revenues 

the internal growth rates for our core organic commissions and fees for the three years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 by division are as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 is as follows in thousands

 the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 is as follows in thousands 

 

  

   

retail division 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 961 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions net of related compensation which we receive will be reflected in our pretax income 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the retail division’s total revenues in 2011 increased 56 or 321 million over the same period in 2010 to 6072 million profitsharing contingent commissions in 2011 decreased 05 million or 35 from 2010 primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance companies in 2010 the 317 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 581 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2010 ii a decrease of 38 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2010 from business divested during 2011 iii a decrease of 04 million for business transferred to our wholesale brokerage division and iv net decrease of 230 million primarily attributable to net lost business the retail division’s negative growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 42 for 2011 and resulted primarily from lower property insurance rates and reduced insurable exposure units in most areas of the united states however as of the end of 2011 there were indications that exposure units’ rates of decline were slowing and some property insurance rates were beginning to increase slightly 

income before income taxes for 2011 increased 76 or 98 million over the same period in 2010 to 1378 million the increase was mainly due to the profitability of our new acquisitions and general cost savings that partially offset the decline in core organic commissions and fees of the 98 million net increase in income before income taxes 37 million resulted from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables partially offsetting the 230 million reduction in core organic commissions and fees were reductions of approximately 99 million in compensation expense and 63 million in other operating expenses led by lower rent and insurance costs 

the retail division’s total revenues in 2010 decreased 14 or 83 million from the same period in 2009 to 5751 million profitsharing contingent commissions in 2010 decreased 46 million or 231 from 2009 primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance companies in 2009 the 41 million net decrease in core commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 236 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue 

  

from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2009 ii a decrease of 15 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2009 from business divested during 2010 and iii net decrease of 269 million primarily attributable to net lost business the retail division’s negative growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 48 for 2010 and resulted primarily from lower property insurance rates and reduced insurable exposure units in most areas of the united states 

income before income taxes for 2010 increased 51 or 63 million over the same period in 2009 to 1280 million even though total revenues were down 83 million total expenses were reduced by 146 million employee compensation and benefits expense was reduced by 27 million primarily due to lower salaries and bonuses noncash stockbased compensation was reduced by 12 million as a result of lower participation in the employee stock purchase plan and certain forfeitures of performance stock plan shares other operating expenses were reduced by 45 million due to broadbased expense reductions a lower intercompany interest allocation of 45 million resulting from reduced acquisition activity and a 17 million credit resulted from changes in the estimated acquisition earnout payables additionally interest expenses of this division related to prior acquisitions decreased by 46 million primarily due to the 10 annual reduction in the cost of capital interest rate charged against the total purchase price of each of the division’s prior acquisitions 

national programs division 

the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and special programs which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups public and quasipublic entities and market niches like the retail division and the wholesale brokerage division the national programs division’s revenues are primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

 the national programs division’s total revenues in 2011 decreased 79 million to 1813 million a 42 decrease from 2010 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2011 decreased 73 million from 2010 of which 29 million related to our condominium program at fiu and 44 million related to proctor fiu’s profitsharing contingent commissions in 2011 was principally attributable to fact that in 2010 fiu received profitsharing contingent commissions representing a delayed 2009 payment proctor’s decreased 

  

profitsharing contingent commissions were the direct result of the lower premiums generated by proctor in 2010 of the 05 million net decrease in core commissions and fees for national programs i an increase of approximately 23 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2010 ii a decrease of 01 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2010 from business divested during 2011 and iii net decrease of 27 million was primarily related to net lost business therefore the national programs division’s negative growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 16 for 2011 of the 27 million of net lost business 44 million related to proctor and was primarily the result of its loss of a large customer 15 million related to our calsurance ® operations and 11 million related to fiu all of which was partially offset by 33 million increase related to our public entity business and a 10 million net aggregate increase attributable to the other programs in the division 

income before income taxes for 2011 decreased 98 or 74 million from the same period in 2010 to 676 million this decrease was primarily driven by the reductions in profitsharing contingent commissions employee compensation and benefits increased 13 million primarily due to higher salaries and producer commission expense noncash stock grant compensation increased 07 million due to the new sip grants made in the first quarter of 2011 and other operating expenses increased slightly by less than 01 million additionally interest expense of this division relating to prior acquisitions decreased by 14 million primarily due to the 10 annual reduction in the cost of capital interest rate charged against the total purchase price of each of the division’s prior acquisitions 

the national programs division’s total revenues in 2010 decreased 14 million to 1892 million a 07 decrease from 2009 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2010 increased 110 million over 2009 of which 58 million related to our condominium program at fiu and 38 million related to proctor fiu’s increased profitsharing contingent commissions were principally attributable to the lack of hurricane activity in florida during 2010 and 2009 proctor’s increased profitsharing contingent commissions were the direct result of the substantial premium growth generated by proctor in 2009 of the 126 million net decrease in core commissions and fees for national programs i an increase of approximately 07 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2009 and ii net decrease of 133 million primarily related to net lost business therefore the national programs division’s negative growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 74 for 2010 of the 133 million of net lost business 107 million related to proctor and was primarily the result of its loss of two large customers 19 million related to the lawyer’s protector plan ® and 09 million related to fiu 

income before income taxes for 2010 increased 64 or 45 million over the same period in 2009 to 749 million even though total revenues decreased 14 million total expenses were reduced by 59 million employee compensation and benefits expense was reduced 06 million primarily due to lower salaries and producer commission expense other operating expenses were reduced by 34 million due to broadbased expense reductions and intercompany interest allocation was reduced by 21 million as a result of reduced acquisition activity additionally interest expense of this division related to prior acquisitions decreased by 21 million primarily due to the 10 annual reduction in the cost of capital interest rate charged against the total purchase price of each of the division’s prior acquisitions 

  

wholesale brokerage division

in accordance with asc topic 470 – debt we classified the related principal balance of the series a senior notes as longterm debt as of december 31 2010 as we had both the intent and ability to refinance the obligation on a longterm basis as evidenced by the confirmation 

on june 12 2008 we entered into an amended and restated revolving loan agreement dated as of june 3 2008 the “prior loan agreement” with a national banking institution amending and restating the existing revolving loan agreement dated september 29 2003 as amended the “revolving agreement” to increase the lending commitment to 500 million subject to potential increases up to 1000 million and to extend the maturity date from december 20 2011 to june 3 2013 the revolving agreement initially provided for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of 750 million after a series of amendments that provided covenant exceptions for the notes issued or to be issued under the master agreement and relaxed or deleted certain mother covenants the maximum principal amount was reduced to 200 million during the three months ended december 31 2011 there were no borrowing against this facility 

on january 9 2012 we entered into 1 an amended and restated revolving and term loan credit agreement the “suntrust agreement” with suntrust bank “suntrust” that provides for a a 1000 million term loan the “suntrust term loan” and b a 500 million revolving line of credit the “suntrust revolver” and 2 a 500 million promissory note the “jpm note” in favor of jpmorgan chase bank na “jpmorgan” pursuant to a letter agreement executed by jp morgan together with the jpm note the “jpm agreement” that provides for a 500 million uncommitted line of credit bridge facility the “jpm bridge facility” the suntrust term loan the suntrust revolver and the jpm bridge facility were each funded on january 9 2012 and provided the financing for the arrowhead acquisition the suntrust agreement amended and restated the prior loan agreement 

the maturity date for the suntrust term loan and the suntrust revolver is december 31 2016 at which time all outstanding principal and unpaid interest will be due both the suntrust term loan and the suntrust revolver may be increased by up to 500 million bringing the total available for each to 1500 million for the suntrust term loan and 1000 million for the suntrust revolver respectively the calculation of interest and fees for the suntrust agreement is generally based on our funded debttoebitda ratio interest is charged at a rate equal to 100 to 140 above libor or 100 below the base rate each as more fully described in the suntrust agreement fees include an upfront fee an availability fee of 0175 to 025 and a letter of credit margin fee of 100 to 140 initially until our march 31 2012 quarter end the applicable margin for libor advances is 100 the availability fee is 0175 and the letter of credit margin fee is 100 the obligations under the suntrust term loan and suntrust revolver are unsecured and the suntrust agreement includes various covenants limitations and events of default that are customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers and that are substantially similar to those contained in the prior loan agreement   

the maturity date for the jpm bridge facility was february 3 2012 at which time all outstanding principal and unpaid interest would have been due on january 26 2012 we entered into a term loan agreement the “jpm agreement” with jpmorgan that provided for a 1000 million term loan the “jpm term loan” the jpm term loan was fully funded on january 26 2012 and provided the financing to fully repay 1 the “jpm bridge facility and 2 the suntrust revolver as a result of the january 26 2012 financing and repayments the jpm bridge facility was terminated and the suntrust revolver’s amount outstanding was brought to zero prior to making subsequent advances thereunder 

the maturity date for the jpm term loan is december 31 2016 at which time all outstanding principal and unpaid interest will be due interest is charged at a rate equal to the alternative base rate or 100 above the adjusted libor rate each as more fully described in the jpm agreement fees include an upfront fee the obligations under the jpm term loan are unsecured and the jpm agreement includes various covenants limitations and events of default that are customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers

the master agreement the prior loan agreement the suntrust agreement and the jpm agreement all require that we maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2011 and 2010 

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our master agreement and the suntrust agreement and the jpm agreement described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2012 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototalcapitalization ratio we would be able to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 

for further discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

in addition we currently have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future from time to time to augment our liquidity and capital resources this self registration statement will expire however on march 4 2012 we intend to file a new shelf registration statement at some point after such expiration

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act the “evaluation” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” as of december 31 2011 based on the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our senior management including our ceo and cfo to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

in conducting brown  brown’s evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting brown  brown has excluded the following acquisitions completed by brown  brown during 2011 balcos insurance inc united benefit services insurance agency llc et al fitzharris agency inc et al public employee benefits solution llc sitzmann morris  lavis insurance agency inc et al snapper shuler kenner inc et al industry consulting group inc and colonial claims corporation et al collectively the “2011 excluded acquisitions” which were acquired during 2011 and whose financial statements constitute 67 and 55 of net and total assets respectively 18 of revenues and 27 of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on brown  brown’s consolidated financial statements 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2011 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and service organization with origins dating from 1939 headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida we market and sell to our customers insurance products and services primarily in the property casualty and employee benefits areas as an agent and broker we do not assume underwriting risks instead we provide our customers with quality noninvestment insurance contracts as well as other targeted customized risk management products and services 

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and by fees paid by customers for certain services commissions are usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases we share commissions with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “profitsharing contingent commission” which is a profitsharing commission based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services and social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers the amount of our revenue from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels 

as of december 31 2010 our activities were conducted in 205 locations in 37 states as follows and one office in london england 

 

 industry overview 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting riskbearing industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the dampening effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 premium rates generally increased beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 

during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by insurance companies from these hurricanes insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states insurance premium rates generally declined during 2006 

  

in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in florida as discussed below insurance premium rates continued to decline from 2007 through 2010 in most of the other us regions during 2007 and 2008 the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent in nevada arizona and florida was hit especially hard we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment the revenues from this operation were significantly and negatively impacted during 2007 through 2009 by these national economic trends and by 2010 these revenues were insignificant 

although insurance premium rates declined from 2008 through 2010 in most lines of coverage the rates of decline appeared to be slowing however during the second half of 2008 and all of 2009 insurable exposure units such as sales and payroll expenditures declined significantly due to the weakening economy primarily in the southeastern and western parts of the united states during 2010 declining exposure units continued to have a greater adverse impact on our commissions and fees revenue than did declining insurance premium rates for 2011 insurance premium rates are expected to remain soft with the exception of some workers’ compensation rates in some states such as florida however exposure units do not seem to be declining at the same pace as they were in the beginning of 2010 as a result it is not unreasonable to believe that insurable exposure units in 2011 could be relatively flat as compared with 2010

for 2011 the advocator group’s revenues are expected to exceed 274 million and could represent as much as 417 of the services division’s total revenues 

employees 

at december 31 2010 we had 5286 fulltime equivalent employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their ability to solicit business from our customers or to hire our employees for a period of time after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere particularly outside of florida 

a number of insurance companies directly sell insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct sales efforts have had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially rather than individually oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers intermediaries or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors tableend we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

we are primarily engaged in the insurance agency wholesale brokerage and insurance programs business and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to further reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

current us economic conditions and the shift away from traditional insurance markets may continue to adversly affect our business 

since late 2007 global consumer confidence has eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values potential inflation volatility in energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit high unemployment and the stability and solvency of financial institutions financial markets businesses and sovereign nations these concerns have slowed economic growth and resulted in a recession in the united states economic conditions have had a negative impact on our results of operations during the years since 2008 due to reduced customer demand if these economic conditions continue or worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including further declines in values of insurable exposure units further declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers any of these effects could decrease our net revenue and profitability 

in addition there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets such as selfinsurance captives risk retention groups and noninsurance capital markets while we compete in these segments on a feeforservice basis we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of profitability as traditional insurance markets 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

traditionally we have maintained cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the limits insured by the fdic while we began in the fall of 2008 refocusing our investment and cash management strategy by moving more of our cash into noninterest bearing accounts which are fdicinsured until december 31 2012 but not subject to any limits and money market accounts a portion of which became fdic insured in the fall of 2008 we still maintain cash and investment balances in excess of the limits insured by fdic as the credit crisis persists the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

  

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the further disruption in the usbased credit markets and by further instability of financial systems 

the disruption in the usbased credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets over the past few years have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies these conditions include significant losses greater volatility significantly less liquidity widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets while these conditions have somewhat abated since the fall of 2008 it is difficult to predict when these conditions will completely end and the extent to which our markets products and business will be adversely affected 

the unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and limited access to capital and credit for many companies although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2013 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited 

inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 

given the current macroeconomic environment it is possible that us government actions in the form of a monetary stimulus a fiscal stimulus or both to the us economy could lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base resulting in an increase in our employee compensation and benefits and our other operating expenses this could harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation on our cost base 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2010 fiscal year we have 1194827000 of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2010 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation a further significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see notes 1 – “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 – “goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

  

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities as disclosed in prior years certain of our offices are parties to profitsharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies including agreements providing for potential payment of revenuesharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies andor additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies additionally to a lesser extent some of our offices are parties to override commission agreements with certain insurance companies which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business such as group health business and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies the company has not chosen to discontinue receiving profitsharing contingent commissions or override commissions the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while we cannot predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations further if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions it would likely adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance andor the provision of services in the ordinary course of business because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of customers provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

  

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 50 of our total commissions and fees revenue was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 50 and 50 respectively of our total commissions and fees were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies for the year ended december 31 2008 52 of our total commissions and fees were derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company should either of these insurance companies seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result no other insurance company accounts for 50 or more of our total commissions and fees 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida indiana michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida indiana michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we derived 7094 million or 734 7166 million or 743 and 7211 million or 746 of our commissions and fees respectively from our operations located in these states we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to customers in these states we believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is primarily a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in the states identified above we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and improve our operations and our financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenue profitability or productivity comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities estimation of the acquisition earnout payable and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

we have expanded our operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve or maintain profitability 

in 2008 we expanded our operations to the united kingdom this was the first time we have opened an office outside the united states in the future we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or customers are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year these commissions generally have accounted for 49 to 59 of our previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that will be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variations specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report results to carriers an interruption of our access to or an inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

we are taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could experience operational disruptions regulatory or other legal problems increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a costeffective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

we are subject to litigation which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are and may be subject to a number of claims regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome of these claims actions and proceedings with certainty 

an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier customer or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

  

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further discussion 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees as well as the loss of any of our executive officers could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services as previously disclosed certain of our former executive officers ceased employment with us during the past year while they are prohibited from soliciting our employees and customers they are not prohibited from competing with us on march 1 2011 a press release was issued by a private equity firm announcing that it had entered into a partnership with two of our former executive officers jim w henderson former vice chairman and chief operating officer who retired from the company in august 2010 and thomas e riley former regional president and chief acquisitions officer whose employment with the company ceased in january 2011 to form a company that would focus on building a middle market insurance brokerage firm and that it planned to invest up to 250 million of equity capital to support the company’s strategy through acquisitions and organic growth 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current customers merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the overall amount of work that we perform for these customers if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that customer or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

healthcare reform and increased costs of current employees’ medical and other benefits could have a materially adverse affect on our business 

our profitability is affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of economic factors beyond our control although we have actively sought to contain increases in these costs there can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

in addition we believe that increased health care costs resulting from the 2010 health care reform bill could have a material adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events 

our operations may be subject to natural disasters or other business disruptions which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes including in florida where our headquarters are located earthquakes power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

  

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at december 31 2010 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 187 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his family members which include his son powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 169 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

changes in laws and regulations may increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended “sarbanesoxley” and the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 have required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of these acts the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated and will continue to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs while these costs are no longer increasing they may in fact increase in the future these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage likewise these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

from time to time new regulations are enacted or existing requirements are changed and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted for example as global warming issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on global warming may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

  

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 and future yearends as required by section 404 of sarbanesoxley investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 

as directed by section 404 of sarbanesoxley the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements however if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

the volume of business from new and existing customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a continuing general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 

we foster a strong decentralized sales culture with a goal of consistent sustained growth over the long term as of january 2011 our senior leadership group included eight executive officers with regional responsibility for oversight of designated operations within the company in july 2010 j scott penny was promoted to the position of regional president and in january 2011 he was named chief acquisitions officer also in january 2011 linda s downs and charles h lydecker were promoted to be regional presidents as previously announced jim w henderson vice chairman and chief operating officer retired from the company in august 2010 and kenneth d kirk regional president and thomas e riley regional president and chief acquisitions officer ceased employment with the company in january 2011 

we increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2008 in 2009 our revenue dropped to 9679 million then increased 06 to 9735 million in 2010 our revenues grew from 956 million in 1993 to 9735 million in 2010 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 146 in the same period we increased net income from 80 million to 1618 million in 2010 a compound annual growth rate of 193 

the past four years have posed significant challenges for us and for our industry in the form of a prevailing decline in insurance premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” increased significant governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace since 2007 resulting in a substantial loss of revenue for us and beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2010 increased pressure on the values of insurable exposure units as the consequence of the general weakening of the economy in the united states 

beginning in the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2010 we experienced negative internal revenue growth each quarter this was due primarily to the “soft market” and beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2010 the decline in insurable exposure units which further reduced our commissions and fees revenue part of the decline in 2007 was the result of the increased governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace as described below in “the florida insurance overview” one industry segment that was hit especially hard during these years was the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent in nevada arizona and florida we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment the revenues from this operation were significantly adversely impacted during 2007 through 2009 by these national economic trends and by 2010 these revenues were insignificant 

while insurance premium rates continued to decline for most lines of coverage during 2010 the rate of decline appeared to be slowing in 2009 and 2010 continued declining exposure units had a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenue than declining insurance premium rates although we do not anticipate any significant changes to the insurance premium rates during 2011 there appears to be a very gradual improvement in the rate of decline of exposure units which we expect will continue into 2011 

  

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 56 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are typically included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in recent years five national insurance companies have replaced the lossratio based profitsharing contingent commission calculation with a guaranteed fixedbase methodology referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gscs” since these gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written as of december 31 2010 we earned 134 million from gscs during 2010 most of this total will not be collected until the first quarter of 2011 for the twelvemonth periods ended december 31 2009 and 2008 we earned 159 million and 134 million respectively from gscs 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services and social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services and 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies these services are provided over a period of time typically one year fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 146 in 2010 133 in 2009 and 137 in 2008 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities as a result of the bank liquidity and solvency issues in the united states in the last quarter of 2008 we moved substantial amounts of our cash into noninterest bearing checking accounts so that they would be fully insured by the federal depository insurance corporation “fdic” or into moneymarket investment funds a portion of which is fdic insured of suntrust and wells fargo two large national banks investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 

florida insurance overview 

many states have established “residual markets” which are governmental or quasigovernmental insurance facilities that provide coverage to individuals andor businesses that cannot buy insurance in the private marketplace ie “insurers of last resort” these facilities can be designed to cover any type of risk or exposure however the exposures most commonly subject to such facilities are automobile or highrisk property exposures residual markets can also be referred to as fair plans windstorm pools joint underwriting associations or may even be given names styled after the private sector like “citizens property insurance corporation” in florida 

in august 2002 the florida legislature created “citizens property insurance corporation” “citizens” to be the “insurer of last resort” in florida initially citizens charged insurance rates that were higher than those generally prevailing in the private insurance marketplace in each of 2004 and 2005 four major hurricanes made landfall in florida as a result of the ensuing significant insurance property losses florida property insurance rates increased in 2006 to counter the higher property insurance rates the state of florida instructed citizens to significantly reduce its property insurance rates beginning in january 2007 by state law citizens guaranteed these rates through january 1 2010 as a result citizens became one of the most if not the most competitive riskbearers for a large percentage of florida’s commercial habitational coastal property exposures such as condominiums apartments and certain assisted living facilities additionally citizens became the only insurance market for certain homeowner policies throughout florida today citizens is one of the largest underwriters of coastal property exposures in florida effective january 1 2010 citizens raised its insurance rates on average 10 for properties with values of less than 10 million and more than 10 for properties with values in excess of 10 million it is expected that citizens will continue to increase its insurance rates during 2011 and as a result the impact of citizens should continue to lessen in 2011 

in 2007 citizens became the principal direct competitor of the insurance companies that underwrite the condominium program administered by one of our indirect subsidiaries florida intracoastal underwriters limited company “fiu” and the excess and surplus lines insurers represented by our wholesale brokers such as hull  company inc another of our subsidiaries consequently these operations lost significant amounts of revenue to citizens from 2008 through 2010 citizens’ impact was not as dramatic as it had been in 2007 fiu’s core revenues decreased 92 in this period citizens continued to be competitive against the excess and surplus lines insurers and therefore citizens negatively affected the revenues of our floridabased wholesale brokerage operations such as hull  company inc from 2007 through 2010 although the impact is decreasing from year to year 

  

citizens’ impact on our florida retail division was less severe than on our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions because our retail offices have the ability to place business with citizens although at slightly lower commission rates and with greater difficulty than is the case with other insurance companies 

current year company overview 

for the fourth consecutive year we experienced negative internal growth of our commissions and fees revenue as a direct result of the general weakness of the economy since the second half of 2008 and the continuing “soft market” our total commissions and fees revenue excluding the effect of recent acquisitions profitsharing contingencies and sales of books of business over the last twelve months reflected a negative internal growth rate of 47 however including the revenues from new acquisitions increased profitsharing contingencies and the increase in other income total revenues in 2010 increased 06 over 2009 

income before income taxes in 2010 increased over 2009 by 45 or 113 million to 2661 million of the 113 million increase 56 million related to increased revenues with the remaining increase attributable to improved cost efficiencies primarily in the area of rent expense and legal costs 

acquisitions 

approximately 37500 independent insurance agencies are estimated to be operating currently in the united states part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance intermediaries to join our operations from 1993 through 2010 we acquired 367 insurance intermediary operations including acquired books of business customer accounts acquisition activity slowed in 2009 in part because potential sellers were unhappy with reduced agency valuations that were the consequence of lower revenues and operating profits due to the continuing “soft market” and decreasing exposure units and therefore opted to defer the sales of their insurance agencies the economic outlook in 2010 improved slightly over 2009 and as a result certain sellers viewed 2010 as a better time in which to join our organization and consequently we were able to close a greater number of acquisitions 

a summary of our acquisitions over the last three years is as follows in millions except for number of acquisitions 

 

   

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 commissions and fees 

commissions and fees revenue including profitsharing contingent commissions increased 02 in 2010 but decreased 01 in 2009 after a 56 increase in 2008 profitsharing contingent commissions increased 71 million to 547 million in 2010 with the increase primarily due to the performance of our national programs division profitsharing contingent commissions decreased 88 million to 476 million in 2009 primarily due to higher loss ratios and therefore lower profitability for insurance carriers core commissions and fees are our commissions and fees less i profitsharing contingent commissions and ii divested business commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold or terminated core commissions and fees revenue decreased 47 in 2010 51 in 2009 and 55 in 2008 the 2010 decrease of 47 represents 427 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 76 million was attributable to our retail wholesale brokerage and services operations based in florida while 218 million related to our nonflorida retail wholesale brokerage and services operations the remaining 133 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue related to our national programs division of which 107 million represented net lost business at proctor financial inc our subsidiary which provides lenderplaced insurance “proctor” 

the 2009 decrease of 51 represented 465 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 224 million was attributable to our retail wholesale brokerage and services operations based in florida the decrease in our nonflorida retail and wholesale brokerage operations in 2009 was 351 million but that was substantially offset by proctor’s strong revenue growth of 134 million 

investment income 

investment income increased slightly to 13 million in 2010 compared with 12 million in 2009 and 61 million in 2008 the 49 million decrease in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to substantially lower investment yields in 2009 even though the average daily invested balance was higher in 2009 than in 2008 

  

other income net 

other income for 2010 reflected income of 52 million compared with 19 million in 2009 and 55 million in 2008 other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets however for 2010 other income also included 15 million paid to us in accordance with judgments rendered in our favor in litigation against former employees for violation of restrictive covenants contained in their employment agreements with us also in 2010 we recognized gains of 12 million from sales of books of business customer accounts although we are not in the business of selling books of business we periodically will sell an office or a book of business because it does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth or for other reasons related to the particular assets in question 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits expense increased on a net basis approximately 06 or 31 million in 2010 however that net increase included 106 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in same time periods of 2010 and 2009 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 74 million the employee compensation and benefit reductions from these offices were primarily related to reductions in staff and management salaries and bonuses of 126 million offset by an increase in compensation of new producers of 32 million for new salaried producers and 08 million for new commissioned producers and an increase of 11 million in group health insurance costs 

employee compensation and benefits decreased on a net basis approximately 02 or 11 million in 2009 however that net decrease included 173 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in same time periods of 2009 and 2008 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 184 million the employee compensation and benefit reductions from these offices were primarily related to reductions in producer commissions staff salaries and bonuses of 159 million offset by an increase in compensation of new salaried producers of 11 million 

employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues remained flat at 501 for both 2010 and 2009 but was 497 in 2008 the increase in the percentage in 2009 from 2008 was the result of the continued reduction of compensation expense due to headcount reductions we had 5286 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2010 compared with 5206 at december 31 2009 and 5398 at december 31 2008 of the net increase of 80 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2010 over the prior yearend an increase of 226 was attributable to acquisitions that continued as standalone offices thus reflecting a net reduction of 146 employees in the offices existing at both yearends 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company has an employee stock purchase plan and grants stock options and nonvested stock awards to its employees compensation expense for all sharebased awards is recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

for 2010 2009 and 2008 the noncash stockbased compensation expense incorporates the costs related to each of our four stockbased plans as explained in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

noncash stockbased compensation decreased 70 or 05 million in 2010 as a result of headcount reductions effective january 2011 we issued new grants under our stock incentive plan sip that will vest in six to ten years subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria by grantees and the achievement of consolidated eps growth at certain levels by the company over a fiveyear measurement period ending december 31 2015 we estimate that the incremental cost of these new sip grants in 2011 will be approximately 51 million 

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 140 in 2010 148 in 2009 and 141 in 2008 other operating expenses in 2010 decreased 75 million from 2009 of which 24 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses from those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2010 and 2009 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices decreased by 99 million of the 99 million decrease 32 million related to reduced net legal fees 25 million related to reductions in office rent expense and the remaining 42 million related to broadbased reductions relating to travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expenses supplies and postage and delivery expenses of the 32 million reduction in net legal fees 38 million related to a reimbursement by an insurance carrier of previously incurred legal costs 

other operating expenses in 2009 increased 60 million over 2008 of which 46 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices therefore other operating expenses from those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2009 and 2008 including the new acquisitions that “folded in” to those offices increased by 14 million of the 14 million increase 30 million resulted from additional legal fees but those costs were partially offset by broadbased reductions relating to travel and entertainment expenses supplies and postage and delivery expenses 

  

amortization 

amortization expense increased 16 million or 32 in 2010 32 million or 69 in 2009 and 62 million or 153 in 2008 the increases in 2010 and 2009 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation decreased 45 in 2010 and 03 in 2009 but increased 41 in 2008 the decreases in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to reduced acquisition activity the increase in 2008 was primarily due to the purchase of new computers related equipment and software corporate aircraft and the depreciation of fixed assets associated with acquisitions completed that year 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 01 million or 09 in 2010 and 01 million or 06 in 2009 primarily as a result of principal payments during those years interest expense increased 09 million or 64 in 2008 over 2007 primarily as a result of the additional 250 million that was borrowed in february 2008 

change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 

for acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 323 million was initially recorded as estimated acquisition earnout payables during 2010 the fair value of the estimated acquisition earnout payables was reevaluated on a quarterly basis and reduced in aggregate by 17 million which resulted in a credit to the consolidated statement of income additionally the interest expense accretion to the consolidated statement of income for 2010 and 2009 was 09 million and 01 million respectively 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 392 in 2010 398 in 2009 and 390 in 2008 the lower effective annual tax rate in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily the result of lower average effective state income tax rates the higher effective annual tax rate in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily the result of reduced benefits from taxexempt interest income and increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates 

  

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments or divisions the retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses result from completed acquisitions within a given division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management emphasizes the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

total core commissions and fees are our total commissions and fees less i profitsharing contingent commissions revenue derived from special revenuesharing commissions from insurance companies based upon the volume and the growth andor profitability of the business placed with such companies during the prior year and ii divested business commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold by the company or terminated

retail division 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 962 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions net of related compensation which we receive will be reflected in our pretax income 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the retail division’s total revenues in 2010 decreased 14 or 83 million from the same period in 2009 to 5751 million profitsharing contingent commissions in 2010 decreased 46 million or 231 from 2009 primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance companies in 2009 the 41 million net decrease in commissions and fees revenue resulted from the following factors i an increase of approximately 236 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2009 ii a decrease of 15 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2009 from business divested during 2010 and iii the remaining net decrease of 269 million was primarily attributable to net lost business the retail division’s negative internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 48 for 2010 and was driven by lower property insurance rates and reduced insurable exposure units in most areas of the united states 

income before income taxes for 2010 increased 51 or 63 million over the same period in 2009 to 1280 million even though total revenues were down 83 million total expenses were reduced by 146 million employee compensation and benefits expense was reduced 27 million primarily due to lower salaries and bonuses noncash stockbased compensation was reduced by 12 million as a result of lower participation in the employee stock purchase plan and certain forfeitures of performance stock plan shares other operating expenses were reduced by 45 million due to broadbased expense reductions a lower intercompany interest allocation of 45 million resulting from reduced acquisition activity and a 17 million credit resulted from changes in the estimated acquisition earnout payables additionally interest expenses of this division for prior acquisitions decreased by 46 million primarily due to the 10 annual reduction in the cost of capital interest rate charged against the total purchase price of the division’s prior acquisitions 

  

the retail division’s total revenues in 2009 decreased 69 million to 5834 million a 12 decrease from 2008 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2009 decreased 60 million from 2008 primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance companies in 2008 approximately 23 million of the change in the retail division’s total revenues was due to net growth in core commissions and fees however 552 million was from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2008 therefore excluding revenues from acquisitions 485 million was lost on a “samestore sales” basis resulting in a negative internal growth rate of 87 most of the negative internal growth resulted from continued reductions in insurable exposure units caused by the significant slowdown in the middlemarket economy during 2009 additionally insurance pricing continued to be competitive primarily in florida and in the western united states 

income before income taxes in 2009 decreased 168 million from 2008 of which 60 million was due to reduced profit sharing contingent commissions and 31 million was due to reduced investment and other income the remaining decrease of 77 million was due to reduced earnings from core commissions and fees offset by earnings from acquisitions 

  

national programs division 

the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and special programs which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups public and quasipublic entities and market niches like the retail division and the wholesale brokerage division the national programs division’s revenues are primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

   

the national programs division’s total revenues in 2010 decreased 14 million to 1892 million a 07 decrease from 2009 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2010 increased 110 million over 2009 of which 58 million of that increase related to our condominium program at fiu and 38 million related to proctor financial inc our subsidiary that provides lenderplaced insurance “proctor” fiu’s increased profitsharing contingent commissions were principally attributable to the lack of hurricane activity in florida during 2010 and 2009 proctor’s increased profitsharing contingent commissions were the direct result of the substantial premium growth generated by proctor in 2009 of the 126 million net decrease in commissions and fees for national programs i an increase of approximately 07 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2009 and ii the remaining net decrease of 133 million was primarily related to net lost business therefore the national programs division’s negative internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 74 for 2010 of the 133 million of net lost business 107 million related to proctor and was primarily the result of its loss of two large customers 19 million related to the lawyer’s protector plan ® and 09 million related to fiu 

income before income taxes for 2010 increased 64 or 45 million over the same period in 2009 to 749 million even though total revenues decreased 14 million total expenses were reduced by 59 million employee compensation and benefits expense was reduced 06 million primarily due to lower salaries and producer commission expense other operating expenses were reduced by 34 million due to broadbased expense reductions and intercompany interest allocation was reduced by 21 million as a result of reduced acquisition activity additionally interest expenses to this division for prior acquisitions decreased by 21 million primarily due to the 10 annual reduction in the cost of capital interest rate charged against the total purchase price of the division’s prior acquisitions 

the national programs division’s total revenues in 2009 increased 123 million to 1906 million a 69 increase over 2008 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2009 increased 02 million over 2008 primarily due to the improved profitability of the insurance carriers during calendar year 2008 of the 124 million increase in core commissions and fees revenues only approximately 17 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2008 the national programs division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 66 excluding core commissions and fees revenues recognized in 2009 from new acquisitions the majority of the internally generated growth in core commissions and fees revenues was primarily related to 134 million of net new business written by proctor additionally our professional liability programs generated net new business of approximately 09 million our condominium program at fiu was down slightly by 03 million and our public entity business lost approximately 09 million of core commissions and fees revenue mainly due to premium rate reductions 

income before income taxes in 2009 increased 71 million to 704 million an 113 increase over 2008 most of this increase resulted from net new business generated by proctor

 the wholesale brokerage division’s total revenues in 2010 increased 04 million over 2009 of which 07 million was attributable to higher profitsharing contingent commissions and 10 million was attributable to an increase in other income and this increase was partially offset by a 13 million reduction in core commissions and fees revenue of the 13 million net decrease in commissions and fees revenue i an increase of approximately 11 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2009 and ii the remaining net decrease of 24 million was primarily due to net lost business as such the wholesale brokerage division’s negative internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue for 2010 was 17 even though the internal growth rate in 2010 remained negative the substantial reduction in the negative growth rates as compared to 2009 and 2008 reflects gradual continuation of the stabilization of coastal property insurance rates and the fact that excess and surplus lines insurance products continue to be more competitive against the standard lines carriers including especially citizens property insurance corporation in florida

the wholesale brokerage division’s total revenues in 2009 decreased 123 million from 2008 of which 80 million was attributable to the reduction in core commissions and fees revenue 30 million was the result of lower profitsharing contingent commissions and 14 million was due to a reduction in investment income of the 80 million net decrease in core commissions and fees only 16 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2008 the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue in 2009 was 63 or 94 million less in revenues than in 2008 excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in 2009 from new acquisitions the 2009 internal growth rate of 63 was an improvement over the 2008 internal growth rate of 146 and represented 135 million less of lost revenues this improvement was reflective of the stabilization of coastal property insurance rates and the fact that excess and surplus lines insurance products have become more competitive against the standard lines carriers including especially citizens 

income before income taxes in 2009 decreased by only 06 million to 170 million a 32 decrease from 2008 even though total revenues decreased 123 million from 2008 this improvement in pretax margin was primarily the result of specific headcount reductions at several of our wholesale brokerage operations which also resulted in a 67 million reduction in employee compensation and benefits additionally we reduced other operating expenses by 15 million primarily in the areas of travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expense and occupancy costs interest expenses for this division for prior acquisitions decreased by 37 million primarily due to the 10 annual reduction in the cost of capital interest rate charged against the total purchase price of the division’s prior acquisitions

financial information relating to our services division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

  

   

the services division’s total revenues in 2010 increased 137 million over 2009 almost exclusively due to acquired revenues attributable to our medicare secondary payer statute “msp” compliancerelated services and our new social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services 

income before income taxes in 2010 increased 07 million over 2009 due to the operations acquired in 2010 additionally interest expenses for this division for the current year acquisitions increased by 19 million primarily due to the interest rate charged against the total purchase price of the division’s acquisitions 

the services division’s total revenues in 2009 increased 06 million from 2008 primarily due to net new business growth generated by our msp compliancerelated services and our workers’ compensation claims business this net new business growth was offset by a 09 million reduction in commissions and fees at our public entity claims services due to the continued drop in the florida workers’ compensation rates 

income before income taxes in 2009 decreased 02 million from 2008 even though total revenues increased slightly in 2009 employee compensation and benefits increased 08 million due to increased staffing associated with our msp compliancerelated services and our workers’ compensation claims business

contractual cash obligations 

as of december 31 2010 our contractual cash obligations were as follows 

 

   

debt 

in july 2004 we completed a private placement of 2000 million of unsecured senior notes the “notes” the 2000 million is divided into two series series a for 1000 million due in 2011 and bearing interest at 557 per year and series b for 1000 million due in 2014 and bearing interest at 608 per year the closing on the series b notes occurred on july 15 2004 the closing on the series a notes occurred on september 15 2004 we have used the proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and repayment of existing debt as of december 31 2010 and 2009 there was an outstanding balance of 2000 million on the notes 

on december 22 2006 we entered into a master shelf and note purchase agreement the “master agreement” with a national insurance company the “purchaser” the purchaser also purchased notes issued by us in 2004 the master agreement provides for a 2000 million private uncommitted “shelf” facility for the issuance of senior unsecured notes over a threeyear period with interest rates that may be fixed or floating and with such maturity dates not to exceed ten years as the parties may determine the master agreement includes various covenants limitations and events of default similar to the notes issued in 2004 the initial issuance of notes under the master agreement occurred on december 22 2006 through the issuance of 250 million in series c senior notes due december 22 2016 with a fixed interest rate of 566 per annum on february 1 2008 250 million in series d senior notes due january 15 2015 with a fixed interest rate of 537 per annum were issued as of december 31 2010 and 2009 there was an outstanding balance of 500 million under the master agreement 

on january 21 2011 we entered into a confirmation of acceptance the “confirmation” in connection with the master agreement in which we agreed to issue to the purchaser and certain of the purchaser’s affiliates an aggregate of 1000 million principal amount of unsecured series e senior notes due september 15 2018 with a fixed interest rate of 45 per year the closing and funding date for the unsecured series e senior notes is identified as september 15 2011 in order to correspond with maturity date of the series a notes in accordance with asc topic 470 – debt the company has classified the related principal balance as longterm debt as of december 31 2010 as the company has both the intent and ability to refinance the obligation on a longterm basis as evidenced by the confirmation 

on june 12 2008 we entered into an amended and restated revolving loan agreement the “loan agreement” dated as of june 3 2008 with a national banking institution amending and restating the existing revolving loan agreement dated september 29 2003 as amended the “revolving agreement” in order to increase the lending commitment to 500 million subject to potential increases up to 1000 million and to extend the maturity date from december 20 2011 to june 3 2013 the revolving agreement initially provided for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of 750 million after a series of amendments that provided covenant exceptions for the notes issued or to be issued under the master agreement and relaxed or deleted certain other covenants the maximum principal amount was reduced to 200 million the calculation of interest and fees is generally based on our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stockbased compensation interest is charged at a rate equal to 050 to 100 above the london interbank offering rate “libor” or 100 below the base rate each as more fully defined in the loan agreement fees include an upfront fee an availability fee of 010 to 020 and a letter of credit usage fee of 050 to 100 the loan agreement contains various covenants limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers the 90day libor was 0300 and 0251 as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively there were no borrowings against this facility at december 31 2010 or 2009 

all three of these credit agreements require that we maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2010 and 2009 

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our master agreement and the loan agreement described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2011 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototalcapitalization ratio we would be able to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 

for further discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

  

in addition we currently have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future from time to time to augment our liquidity and capital resources 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1—summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later at that date the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification concerning matters necessitating such adjustments from the insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received from insurance companies or when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized 

acquisition purchase prices are typically based on a multiple of average annual operating profit earned over a one to threeyear period within a minimum and maximum price range the recorded purchase price for all acquisitions consummated after january 1 2009 included an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earnout provisions subsequent changes in the fair value of earnout obligations will be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred 

the fair value of earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements in determining fair value the acquired business’s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth andor profitability the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections these payments are then discounted to present value using a riskadjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earnout payments will be made 

  

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and assesses the recoverability of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2010 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards to its employees which requires that the related compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

litigation claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line and term loan agreements 

our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments and certificates of deposit at december 31 2010 and 2009 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date

in conducting brown  brown’s evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting brown  brown has excluded the following acquisitions completed by brown  brown during 2010 medical settlement protocols dimartino associates inc crowe paradis holding company etal thomas r jones inc and martin benefits consulting llc collectively the “2010 excluded acquisitions” which were acquired during 2010 and whose financial statements constitute 73  and 55 of net and total assets respectively 20 of revenues and 21 of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on brown  brown’s consolidated financial statements 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2010 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting riskbearing industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 premium rates generally increased beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance the premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 

during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance companies from these hurricanes the insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states the insurance premium rates in general declined during 2006 

in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in florida as discussed below insurance premium rates continued to decline during the 2007 to 2009 period in most of the other us regions during 2007 and 2008 the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent nevada arizona and florida was especially hit hard we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents these operations’ revenues were significantly impacted during 2007 through 2009 by these national economic trends 

although premium insurance rates declined during 2008 and 2009 in most lines of coverages the rate of declines appeared to be slowing however during the second half of 2008 and all of 2009 insurable exposure units such as sales and payroll expenditures declined significantly due to the weakening economy primarily in the southeast and western parts of the united states for 2010 declining exposure units will most likely continue to have a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than will declining insurance premium rates 

segment information 

our business is divided into four reportable operating segments 1 the retail division 2 the national programs division 3 the wholesale brokerage division and 4 the services division the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public entity professional and individual customers 

  

  

the national programs division contains two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals and special programs which markets targeted products and services to specific industries trade groups public entities and market niches the wholesale brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal insurance and reinsurance primarily through independent agents and brokers the services division provides clients with thirdparty claims administration consulting for the workers’ compensation insurance market comprehensive medical utilization management services in both workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas and medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services 

the following table sets forth a summary of 1 the commissions and fees revenue generated by each of our reportable operating segments for 2009 2008 and 2007 and 2 the percentage of our total commissions and fees revenue represented by each segment for each such period 

 

 we conduct all of our operations within the united states of america except for one wholesale brokerage operation based in london england that commenced business in march 2008 this operation earned 66 million and 26 million of revenue for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively we do not have any material foreign longlived assets see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional segment financial data relating to our business

employees 

at december 31 2009 we had 5206 fulltime equivalent employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our insured customers and employees after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our insured customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere particularly outside of florida 

a number of insurance companies engage in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct sales efforts have had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially rather than individually oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors tableend we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

we are primarily engaged in the insurance agency wholesale brokerage and insurance programs business and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

the current economic conditions in the u s economy continue to affect our business 

since late 2007 global consumer confidence has recently eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values potential inflation volatility in energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit high unemployment and the stability and solvency of financial institutions financial markets businesses and sovereign nations these concerns have slowed economic growth and resulted in a recession in the united states recent economic conditions have had a negative impact on our results of operations during the year ended december 31 2009 due to reduced customer demand which is expected to continue for the next several fiscal quarters if these economic conditions continue or worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including further declines in values of insurable exposure units further declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers any of these effects could decrease our net revenue and profitability 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

traditionally we have maintained cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the fdic insurance limits while we began in the fall of 2008 refocusing our investment and cash management strategy by moving more of our cash into noninterest bearing accounts which are fdic insured until june 30 2010 but not subject to any limits and money market accounts a portion of which became fdic insured in the fall of 2008 we still maintain cash and investment balances in excess of the fdic insurance limits as the credit crisis persists the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue if one or more of the depository institutions with which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the further disruption in the usbased credit markets and by further instability of financial systems 

the recent disruption in the usbased credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies these conditions include significant losses greater volatility significantly less liquidity widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets while these conditions have somewhat abated since the fall of 2008 it is difficult to predict when these conditions will completely end and the extent to which our markets products and business will be adversely affected 

  

these unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and limited access to capital and credit for many companies although we are not currently experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2013 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations are depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance we have no control over these matters to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive or limited 

inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 

given the current macroeconomic environment it is possible that us government actions in the form of a monetary stimulus a fiscal stimulus or both to the us economy could lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base particularly resulting in an increase in our employee compensation benefits and our other operating expenses this may harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation in our cost base 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2009 fiscal year we have 1074397 of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2009 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation a further significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis prior to the next annual goodwill impairment test if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would then record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see notes 1 – “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 – “goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while we cannot predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations further if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions it would likely adversely effect our results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims clients may assert errors and omissions claims against us alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

  

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us subject to our selfinsured deductibles have been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 50 and 50 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies for the year ended december 31 2008 52 of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 53 and 53 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies should either of these insurance companies seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result no other insurance company accounts for 5 or more of our total revenues 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida indiana michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida indiana michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and december 31 2007 we derived 7166 million or 743 7211 million or 746 and 6739 million or 737 of our commissions and fees respectively from our operations located in these states we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to clients in these states we believe the regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states currently is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in a few states we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of insurance agencies brokers and other intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets requires us to implement and improve our operations financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenue profitability or productivity comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows 

we recently expanded our operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve profitability 

in 2008 we expanded our operations to the united kingdom this was the first time we have opened an office outside the united states in addition we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediaries business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for clients and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several state legislatures among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

  

profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year these commissions generally have accounted for 49 to 66 of our previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions materially affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that will be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production we do not control the factors that cause these variation specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in one of our quarters or years until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may adversely effect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings changes in securities analysts’ predictions regarding the shortterm and longterm future of our industry and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the loss of any member of our senior management team could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results 

we believe that our future success partly depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including senior management brokers and other key personnel although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our ability to conduct business would be negatively impacted in the event of an interruption in information technology andor data security andor outsourcing relationships 

our business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our customers process claims and timely and accurately report results to carriers an interruption of or inability to access our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 

computer viruses hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security could expose us to data loss monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 

we are taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities maintaining protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

our technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 

improper disclosure of confidential information could negatively impact our business 

we are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees we have put in place policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information however we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further privacy laws and regulations are continuously changing and often are inconsistent among the states in which we operate our failure to adhere to or successfully implement procedures to respond to these requirements could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation 

  

we are subject to litigation which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are and may be subject to a number of claims regulatory actions and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we cannot and likely will not be able to predict the outcome of these claims actions and proceedings with certainty 

an adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period in addition regardless of monetary costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier client or employee relationships or divert personnel and management resources 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further discussion 

our inability to retain or hire qualified employees could negatively impact our ability to retain existing business and generate new business 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel there is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees especially in key positions if we are not able to successfully attract retain and motivate our employees our business financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

losing employees who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements which would adversely affect our results of operations also if any of our key professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 

in addition we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our of our key executives while we have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with certain key executives these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the overall amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

  

healthcare reform and increased costs of current employees’ medical and other benefits could have a materially adverse affect on our business 

our profitability is affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits in recent years we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of economic factors beyond our control although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs there can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting future cost increases and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability 

in addition the us house of representatives and the us senate passed separate health care reform bills late in 2009 both chambers are seeking to reconcile their bills and therefore we do not currently know the ultimate outcome of the reconciliation process or the legislation depending on the provisions contained in the final law this legislation could have a material adverse impact on our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events 

our operations may be subject to natural disasters or other business disruptions which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes including in florida where our headquarters are located earthquakes power shortages telecommunications failures water shortages floods fire extreme weather conditions geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or manmade disasters our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

  

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at february 23 2010 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 207 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and his family members which include his son powell brown our president and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 161 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 our affairs and policies 

changes in the laws and regulations may increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 has required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of that act the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs while these costs are no longer increasing they may in fact increase in the future these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage likewise these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

from time to time new regulations are enacted or existing requirements are changed and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations and changes will be implemented and enforced we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted for example as global warming issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues this increasing governmental focus on global warming may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us and our customers this could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 and future yearends as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 

as directed by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements however if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

  

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels to determine what premium to charge the insured insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies none of which we control 

the volume of business from new and existing insured customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a continuing general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have typically grown as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 

we foster a strong decentralized sales culture with a goal of consistent sustained growth over the long term in 2009 our senior leadership group included 12 executive officers with regional responsibility for oversight of designated operations within the company in july 2009 j powell brown who serves as president of brown  brown inc succeeded his father j hyatt brown as chief executive officer mr hyatt brown continues to serve as chairman of the board and remains actively involved with acquisitions and recruitment as previously announced jim w henderson vice chairman and chief operating officer will retire from the company in august 2010 

we increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2008 however in 2009 our revenues declined from the prior year to 9679 million our revenue growth from 1993 to 2009 reflects a compound annual growth rate of 156 in the same period we increased net income from 80 million to 1533 million in 2009 a compound annual growth rate of 203 

the past three years have posed significant challenges for us and for our industry in the form of a prevailing decline in insurance premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” increased significant governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace since 2007 resulting in a substantial loss of revenues for us and beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009 increased pressure on the values of insurable exposure units as the consequence of the general weakening of the economy in the united states 

beginning in the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009 we experienced negative internal revenue growth each quarter this was due primarily to the “soft market” and beginning in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009 the decline in insurable exposure units which further reduced our commissions and fees revenues part of the decline in 2007 was the result of the increased governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace as described below in “the florida insurance overview” one industry segment that was hit especially hard during these years was the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent in nevada arizona and florida we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents these operations’ revenues were negatively affected by these national economic trends primarily in 2007 and 2008 but continuing into 2009 

while insurance premium rates continued to decline for most lines of coverage during 2009 the rate of decline appears to have been less than in 2008 in 2009 continued declining exposure units had a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than declining insurance premium rates even though we do not anticipate significant additional declines in exposure units or pricing in 2010 we currently do not see any indications of improvement in these areas 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 59 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are typically included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered in recent years five national insurance companies have replaced the lossratio based profitsharing contingent commission calculation with a guaranteed fixedbased methodology referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gsc” since these gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written as of december 31 2009 we earned 159 million from gscs during 2009 most of this total will not be collected until the first quarter of 2010 for the twelvemonth periods ended december 31 2008 and 2007 we earned 134 million and 66 million respectively from gscs 

fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions which are recognized as services are rendered fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services and 2 our national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies these services are provided over a period of time typically one year fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 133 in 2009 137 in 2008 and 143 in 2007 

historically investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities as a result of the bank liquidity and solvency issues in the united states in the last quarter of 2008 we moved substantial amounts of our cash into noninterest bearing checking accounts so that they would be fully insured by the federal depository insurance corporation “fdic” or into moneymarket investment funds a portion of which recently became fdic insured of suntrust and wells fargo two large national banks investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments in 2007 we sold our investment in rocktenn company for a net gain of 187 million 

  

florida insurance overview 

many states have established “residual markets” which are governmental or quasigovernmental insurance facilities that provide coverage to individuals andor businesses that cannot buy insurance in the private marketplace ie “insurers of last resort” these facilities can be designed to cover any type of risk or exposure however the exposures most commonly subject to such facilities are automobile or highrisk property exposures residual markets can also be referred to as fair plans windstorm pools joint underwriting associations or may even be given names styled after the private sector like “citizens property insurance corporation” in florida 

in august 2002 the florida legislature created “citizens property insurance corporation” “citizens” to be the “insurer of last resort” in florida initially citizens charged insurance rates that were higher than those generally prevailing in the private insurance marketplace in each of 2004 and 2005 four major hurricanes made landfall in florida as a result of the ensuing significant insurance property losses florida property insurance rates increased in 2006 to counter the increased property insurance rates the state of florida instructed citizens to essentially reduce its property insurance rates by half beginning in january 2007 by state law citizens guaranteed these rates through january 1 2010 as a result citizens became one of the most if not the most competitive riskbearers for a large percentage of florida’s commercial habitational coastal property exposures such as condominiums apartments and certain assisted living facilities additionally citizens became the only insurance market for certain homeowner policies throughout florida today citizens is one of the largest underwriters of coastal property exposures in florida effective january 1 2010 citizens’ raised its insurance rates on average 10 for properties with values of less than 10 million and more than 10 for properties with values in excess of 10 million as a result the impact of citizens’ should continue to decline in 2010 

in 2007 citizens became the principal direct competitor of the insurance companies that underwrite the condominium program administered by one of our indirect subsidiaries florida intracoastal underwriters limited company “fiu” and the excess and surplus lines insurers represented by our wholesale brokers such as hull  company inc another of our subsidiaries consequently these operations lost significant amounts of revenue to citizens during 2008 and 2009 fiu’s revenues were relatively flat and therefore citizens’ impact was not as dramatic as in 2007 citizens continued to be competitive with the excess and surplus lines insurers however and therefore negatively affected the revenues of our floridabased wholesale brokerage operations such as hull  company inc from 2007 through 2009 

citizens’ impact on our florida retail division was less severe than on our national program and wholesale brokerage divisions because our retail offices have the ability to place business with citizens although at slightly lower commission rates and with greater difficulty in placing coverage 

  

current year company overview 

for the third consecutive year we recorded negative internal revenue growth of our commissions and fees revenues as a direct result of the general weakness of the economy since the second half of 2008 and the continuing “soft market” our total commissions and fees revenues excluding the effect of recent acquisitions profitsharing contingencies and sales of books of business over the last twelve months had a negative internal growth rate of 51 

during 2009 investment income and other income were substantially less than in 2008 and 2007 due principally to the fact that investment yields dropped significantly in each of the last two years and to the fact that we had more infrequent gain transactions in 2008 and 2007 

acquisitions 

approximately 18000 independent insurance agencies are estimated to currently be operating in the united states part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance agencies to join our operations from 1993 through 2009 we acquired 334 insurance intermediary operations including acquired books of business customer accounts that had aggregate estimated annual revenues of 8890 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition acquisition activity slowed in 2009 in part because potential sellers were unhappy with reduced agency valuations that were the consequences of lower revenues and operating profits due to the continuing “soft market” and decreasing exposure units and therefore opted to defer the sales of their insurance agencies 

a summary of our acquisitions over the last three years is as follows in millions except for number of acquisitions 

 

 results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

   

commissions and fees 

commissions and fees revenue including profitsharing contingent commissions decreased 01 in 2009 but increased 56 in 2008 and 58 in 2007 profitsharing contingent commissions decreased 88 million to 476 million in 2009 and 12 million to 564 million in 2008 primarily due to higher loss ratios and therefore lower profitability for insurance carriers core commissions and fees revenue decreased 51 in 2009 55 in 2008 and 34 in 2007 when excluding commissions and fees revenue generated from acquired and divested operations the 2009 decrease of 51 represents 465 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 224 million is related to our retail wholesale and services operations based in florida the decrease in our nonflorida retail and wholesale brokerage operations in 2009 was 351 million but that was substantially offset by another year of strong revenue growth of 134 million in proctor financial inc a subsidiary that provides lenderplaced insurance coverage the 2008 decrease of 55 represents 467 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 310 million was related to our retail wholesale and services operations based in florida the decrease in our nonflorida retail and wholesale brokerage operations in 2008 was 323 million which was substantially offset by strong revenue growth of 148 million in proctor financial 

investment income 

investment income decreased to 12 million in 2009 compared with 61 million in 2008 and 305 million in 2007 the 49 million decrease in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to substantially lower investment yields in 2009 even though the average daily invested balance was higher in 2009 than in 2008 the 244 million decrease in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to the sale of our investment in rocktenn company in 2007 for a net gain of 187 million the remaining 57 million decrease in investment income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields 

other income net 

other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets in 2009 gains of 02 million were recognized from sales of books of business customer accounts as compared with 10 million and 137 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively although we are not in the business of selling books of business we periodically will sell an office or a book of business that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits decreased on a net basis approximately 02 or 11 million in 2009 however within that net decrease was 173 million of new compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were standalone offices and therefore employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in same time periods of 2009 and 2008 including the new acquisitions that folded into those offices decreased by 184 million the employee compensation and benefit reductions from these offices were primarily related to producer commissions staff salaries and bonuses of 159 million offset by an increase in compensation of new salaried producers of 11 million employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 94 or 417 million in 2008 of which an increase of 468 million was related to acquisitions that were standalone offices of the remaining net 51 million decrease from the offices in existence in both 2008 and 2007 including the new acquisitions that folded into those offices the major decreases were primarily related to producer commissions and bonuses of 107 million offset by an increase in compensation of new salaried producers of 49 million 

employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues increased in each of the last two years representing 501 in 2009 497 in 2008 and 463 in 2007 and is the result of the significant loss of revenues although minimized by the continued reduction of compensation expense by headcount reductions we had 5206 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2009 compared with 5398 at december 31 2008 and 5047 at december 31 2007 of the 192 net decrease in fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2009 over the prior yearend an increase of 86 was from the acquisitions that continued as standalone offices thus reflecting a net reduction of 278 employees in the offices existing at both yearends 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards to its employees compensation expense for all sharebased awards is recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

for 2009 2008 and 2007 the noncash stockbased compensation expense incorporates the costs related to each of our three stockbased plans as explained in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

noncash stockbased compensation increased 06 or less than 01 million in 2009 as a result of a full year of expense from the performance stock plan “psp” shares and incentive stock options “iso” granted primarily in february 2008 prior to the february 2008 grants the last major grant of psp and iso shares occurred in january 2003 

  

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 148 in 2009 141 in 2008 and 137 in 2007 other operating expenses in 2009 increased 60 million over 2008 of which 46 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices the remaining net 14 million increase from the offices in existence in both 2009 and 2008 including the new acquisitions that “folded into” those existing offices were broadbased reductions relating to travel and entertainment expenses supplies and postage and delivery expenses however such cost savings were offset by 30 million of additional legal fees other operating expenses in 2008 increased 60 million over 2007 of which 122 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices the remaining net 62 million decrease from the offices in existence in both 2008 and 2007 including the new acquisitions that “folded into” those offices were broadbased reductions relating to supplies telephone insurance legal and claims expenses 

amortization 

amortization expense increased 32 million or 69 in 2009 62 million or 153 in 2008 and 39 million or 108 in 2007 the increases in 2009 and 2008 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation decreased 03 in 2009 but increased 41 in 2008 and 129 in 2007 the slight decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower acquisition activity the increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to the purchase of new computers related equipment and software corporate aircraft and the depreciation of fixed assets associated with acquisitions completed in those years 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 01 million or 06 in 2009 over 2008 primarily as a result of principal payments during 2009 interest expense increased 09 million or 64 in 2008 over 2007 primarily as a result of the additional 250 million that was borrowed in february 2008 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 398 in 2009 390 in 2008 and 387 in 2007 the successive higher effective annual tax rate from 2007 to 2009 was primarily the result of continued reduced benefits from taxexempt interest income and increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates during 2007 the irs concluded its audit of our 20042006 tax years in which it disputed our method of recognizing profitsharing contingent commissions for tax purposes we recognize profitsharing contingent commissions when determinable which is when such commissions are received however the irs believes that we should estimate those amounts as of each december 31 we agreed to resolve this dispute for a 11 million payment of interest and our agreement to accrue at each december 31 for tax purposes only a known amount of profitsharing contingent commissions represented by the actual amount of profitsharing contingent commissions received in the first quarter of the related year with a trueup adjustment to the actual amount received by the following march 31 because this method now required for tax purposes differs from the method used for book purposes it will result in a current deferred tax asset as of december 31 each year which will be reversed by the following march 31 when the related profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized for financial accounting purposes 

  

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments or divisions the retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses result from completed acquisitions within a given division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management places emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

total core commissions and fees are our total commissions and fees less i profitsharing contingent commissions revenue derived from special revenuesharing commissions from insurance companies based upon the volume and the growth andor profitability of the business placed with such companies during the prior year and ii divested business commissions and fees generated from offices books of business or niches sold by the company or terminated

retail division 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 962 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions net of related compensation that we receive will be reflected in our pretax income 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the retail division’s total revenues in 2009 decreased 69 million to 5834 million a 12 decrease from 2008 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2009 decreased 60 million from 2008 primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance companies in 2008 approximately 23 million of the change in the retail division’s total revenues was due to net growth in core commissions and fees however 552 million was from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2008 therefore excluding revenues from acquisitions 485 million was lost on a “samestore sales” basis resulting in a negative internal growth rate of 87 most of the negative internal growth resulted from continued reductions in insurable exposure units caused by the significant slow down in the middlemarket economy during 2009 additionally insurance pricing continues to be competitive primarily in florida and in the western united states 

income before income taxes in 2009 decreased 168 million from 2008 of which 60 million was due to reduced profit sharing contingent commissions and 31 million was due to reduced investment and other income the remaining decrease of 77 million was due to reduced earnings from core commissions and fees offset by earnings from acquisitions 

the retail division’s total revenues in 2008 increased 278 million to 5902 million a 49 increase over 2007 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2008 decreased 75 million from 2007 primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance carriers in 2007 approximately 457 million of the change in the retail division’s total revenues was due to net growth in core commissions and fees however 921 million was from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2007 therefore after removing the revenue from acquisitions from the calculation 347 million was lost on a “samestore sales” basis resulting in a negative internal growth rate of 69 most of the negative internal growth resulted from continued competitive insurance pricing primarily in florida additionally even though there are signs that declines in insurance rates are slowing the second half of 2008 was marked by indications of additional slowing of the economy which resulted in a reduction in insurable exposure units for 2009 the slowing economy will most likely have a greater impact on the premium volume of our customers than will the insurance premium rates 

income before income taxes in 2008 decreased 207 million from 2007 of which 111 million was primarily attributable to a historically high amount of gains from the sales of books of business customer accounts in 2007 the remaining decrease of 96 million was due to reduced profitsharing contingent commissions and to reduced earnings from core commissions and fees offset by earnings from acquisitions

financial information relating to our wholesale brokerage division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the wholesale brokerage division’s total revenues in 2009 decreased 123 million from 2008 of which 80 million was attributable to the reduction in core commissions and fees revenues 30 million was the result of lower profitsharing contingent commissions and 14 million was due to a reduction in investment income of the 80 million net decrease in core commissions and fees only 16 million related to core commissions and fees revenues from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2008 the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenues in 2009 was 63 or 94 million less in revenues than in 2008 excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in 2009 from new acquisitions the 2009 internal growth rate of 63 is an improvement over the 2008 internal growth rate of 146 and represents 135 million of less revenues lost this improvement is reflective of stabilizing coastal property insurance rates and the fact that excess and surplus lines carriers products have become more competitive against the standard lines carriers especially as it relates to citizens property insurance corporation in florida 

income before income taxes in 2009 decreased by only 06 million to 170 million a 32 decrease from 2008 even though total revenues decreased 123 million from 2008 this improvement in pretax margin was primarily the result of specific headcount reductions at several of our wholesale operations which was also the main reason for a 67 million reduction in employee compensation and benefits additionally we reduced other operating expenses by 15 million primarily in the areas of travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expense and occupancy costs interest expenses to this division for prior acquisitions decreased by 37 million primarily due to the 10 annual reduction in the cost of capital interest rate charged against the total purchase price of the division’s prior acquisitions

income before income taxes in 2008 decreased 104 million to 176 million a 371 decrease from 2007 this decrease is due primarily to net lost business lower investment income and an increase in other operating expenses primarily from data processing bad debts rent and telephone expenses 

  

services division

financial information relating to our services division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the services division’s total revenues in 2009 increased 06 million from 2008 primarily due to net new business growth generated by our medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services and our workers’ compensation claims business this net new business growth was offset by a 09 million reduction in commissions and fees at our public entity claims services due to the continued drop in the florida workers’ compensation rates 

income before income taxes in 2009 decreased 02 million from 2008 even though total revenues increased slightly in 2009 employee compensation and benefits increased 08 million due to increased staffing at our medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services and our workers’ compensation claims business

income before income taxes in 2008 decreased 15 million from 2007 primarily due to the loss of 42 million of workers’ compensation claims business which was partially offset by the transfer of approximately 23 million of the related ongoing annual claimspaying costs

contractual cash obligations 

as of december 31 2009 our contractual cash obligations were as follows 

 

 debt 

in july 2004 the company completed a private placement of 2000 million of unsecured senior notes the “notes” the 2000 million is divided into two series series a for 1000 million due in 2011 and bearing interest at 557 per year and series b for 1000 million due in 2014 and bearing interest at 608 per year the closing on the series b notes occurred on july 15 2004 the closing on the series a notes occurred on september 15 2004 brown  brown has used the proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and repayment of existing debt as of december 31 2009 and 2008 there was an outstanding balance of 2000 million on the notes 

on december 22 2006 the company entered into a master shelf and note purchase agreement the “master agreement” with a national insurance company the “purchaser” the purchaser also purchased notes issued by the company in 2004 the master agreement provides for a 2000 million private uncommitted “shelf” facility for the issuance of senior unsecured notes over a threeyear period with interest rates that may be fixed or floating and with such maturity dates not to exceed ten 10 years as the parties may determine the master agreement includes various covenants limitations and events of default similar to the notes issued in 2004 the initial issuance of notes under the master agreement occurred on december 22 2006 through the issuance of 250 million in series c senior notes due december 22 2016 with a fixed interest rate of 566 per annum on february 1 2008 250 million in series d senior notes due january 15 2015 with a fixed interest rate of 537 per annum were issued as of december 31 2009 there was an outstanding balance of 500 million under the master agreement 

  

on june 12 2008 the company entered into an amended and restated revolving loan agreement the “loan agreement” with a national banking institution that was dated as of june 3 2008 amending and restating the existing revolving loan agreement dated september 29 2003 as amended the “revolving agreement” in order to increase the lending commitment to 500 million subject to potential increases up to 1000 million and to extend the maturity date from december 20 2011 to june 3 2013 the revolving agreement initially provided for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of 750 million after a series of amendments that provided covenant exceptions for the notes issued or to be issued under the master agreement and relaxed or deleted certain other covenants the maximum principal amount was reduced to 200 million the calculation of interest and fees is generally based on the company’s quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stockbased compensation interest is charged at a rate equal to 050 to 100 above the london interbank offering rate “libor” or 100 below the base rate each as more fully defined in the loan agreement fees include an upfront fee an availability fee of 010 to 020 and a letter of credit usage fee of 050 to 100 the loan agreement contains various covenants limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers the 90day libor was 0251 and 1425 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively there were no borrowings against this facility at december 31 2009 or 2008 

in january 2001 brown  brown entered into a 900 million unsecured sevenyear term agreement with a national banking institution the “term agreement” bearing an interest rate based upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus 050 to 100 depending upon brown  brown’s quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stockbased compensation the 90day libor was 470 as of december 31 2007 this loan was fully funded on january 3 2001 and was to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of 32 million through december 2007 as of december 31 2007 the outstanding balance had been paid in full 

all four of these credit agreements require or required brown  brown to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants brown  brown was in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2009 and 2008 

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our master agreement and the loan agreement described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2010 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototalcapitalization ratio we would have the ability to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1—summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later at that date the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification concerning matters necessitating such adjustments from the insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received from insurance companies or when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

  

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized 

intangible assets impairment 

goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and assesses the recoverability of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2009 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards to its employees which requires that the related compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

litigation claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income 

  

derivative instruments 

in 2002 we entered into one derivative financial instrument—an interest rate exchange agreement or “swap”—to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our 900 million variable rate debt as of december 31 2006 we maintained this swap agreement whereby we paid a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank paid us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base libor we assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in the fair market value of the swap were reflected in other comprehensive income the fair market value of this instrument was determined by quotes obtained from the related counterparties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows the valuation of this derivative instrument was a significant estimate that was largely affected by changes in interest rates as of december 31 2007 this interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with the final payment on the related 900 million variable rate debt

we carried out an evaluation required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act the “evaluation” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” as of december 31 2009 based on the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our senior management including our ceo and cfo to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

in conducting brown  brown’s evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting brown  brown has excluded the following acquisitions completed by brown  brown during 2009 conner strong companies inc small business unit one source insurance inc irving weber associates inc and camford national insurance brokers llc collectively the “2009 excluded acquisitions” which were acquired during 2009 and whose financial statements constitute 21  and 15 of net and total assets respectively 12 of revenues and 11 of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on brown  brown’s consolidated financial statements 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2009 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

ceo and cfo certifications 

exhibits 311 and 312 are the certifications of the ceo and the cfo respectively the certifications are required in accordance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “section 302 certifications” this item of this report which you are currently reading is the information concerning the evaluation referred to in the section 302 certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting riskbearing industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance the premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance companies from these hurricanes the insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states the insurance premium rates in general declined during 2006 in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in the state of florida as discussed below the insurance premium rates continued to decline during 2007 and 2008 in most of the other regions of the united states one industry segment that was especially hit hard during 2007 and 2008 was the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent nevada arizona and florida we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents both of these operations’ revenues were significantly impacted in 2007 and 2008 by these national economic trends although premium insurance rates declined during most of 2008 in most lines of coverages the rate of declines appeared to slow in the second half of the year however during the second half of 2008 there were more indications that insurable exposure units such as sales and payroll expenditures were declining for 2009 declining exposure units will most likely have a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than will declining insurance premium rates

 services division 

at december 31 2008 our services division employed 275 persons and provided the following services 1 insurancerelated services including comprehensive risk management and thirdparty administration “tpa” services for insurance entities and selffunded or fullyinsured workers’ compensation and liability plans 2 comprehensive medical utilization management services for both workers’ compensation and alllines liability insurance plans and 3 medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services 

the services division’s workers’ compensation and liability plan tpa services include claims administration access to major reinsurance markets cost containment consulting services for secondary disability and subrogation recoveries and risk management services such as loss control in 2008 our three largest workers’ compensation contracts represented approximately 257 of our services division’s fees revenue or approximately 08 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in addition the services division provides managed care services including medical networks case management and utilization review services certified by the american accreditation health care commission 

  

employees 

at december 31 2008 we had 5398 fulltime equivalent employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our insured customers and employees after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our insured customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price there are a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence that compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere this situation is particularly pronounced outside of florida 

a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct sales efforts have had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially rather than individually oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which in turn has resulted and could continue to result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors tableend we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

we are primarily engaged in insurance agency wholesale brokerage and insurance programs business and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

the gross domestic product in the us has declined indicating that the us economy is in a recession 

global consumer confidence has recently eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values potential inflation volatility in energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit rising unemployment and the stability and solvency of financial institutions financial markets businesses and sovereign nations these concerns have slowed economic growth and resulted in a recession in the united states recent economic conditions have had a negative impact on our results of operations during the year ended december 31 2008 due to reduced customer demand which is expected to continue for the next several fiscal quarters if these economic conditions continue or worsen a number of negative effects on our business could result including further declines in values of insurable exposure units further declines in insurance premium rates and the financial insolvency or reduced ability to pay of certain of our customers any of these effects could decrease our net revenue and profitability 

we could incur substantial losses from our cash and investment accounts if one of the financial institutions that we use fails or is taken over by the us federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” 

traditionally we have maintained cash and investment balances including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts at various depository institutions in amounts that are significantly in excess of the fdic insurance limits while we have recently refocused our investment and cash management strategy by moving more of our cash into noninterest bearing accounts which are fdic insured but not subject to any limits and money market accounts a portion of which recently became fdic insured we still maintain cash and investment balances in excess of the fdic insurance limits as the credit crisis persists the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue if one or more of the depository institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited and we could face material liquidity problems and potential material financial losses 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the current disruption in the usbased credit markets and by the instability of financial systems 

the current disruption in the usbased credit markets the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies these conditions include significant losses greater volatility significantly less liquidity widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets most recently such volatility has reached unprecedented levels and credit markets have been illiquid these conditions have resulted in the failure of a number of financial institutions and unprecedented action by governmental authorities and central banks around the world including investing in or lending money to financial institutions and insurance companies that are perceived to need additional capital it is difficult to predict how long these conditions will persist and the extent to which our markets products and business will be adversely affected 

these unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies although we are not currently 

  

experiencing any limitation of access to our revolving credit facility which matures in 2013 and are not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of our lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend us credit the failure of a lender could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings 

we also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance if those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our business and therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by economic conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity 

our results of operations are dependent upon the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage which depends in turn on insurance carriers’ ability to procure reinsurance a matter over which we have no control to the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage desired by our customers and the coverage we are able to procure may be more expensive 

inflation may adversely affect our business operations in the future 

given the current macroeconomic environment it is possible that us government actions in the form of a monetary stimulus a fiscal stimulus or both to the us economy may lead to inflationary conditions that would adversely affect our cost base particularly resulting in an increase in our employee compensation benefits and our other operating expenses this may harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or cut costs enough to offset the effects of inflation in our cost base 

we are exposed to intangible asset risk specifically our goodwill may become impaired in the future 

as of the date of the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the 2008 fiscal year we have 1023372 of goodwill recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” we perform a goodwill impairment test at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2008 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation a further significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis under sfas 142 in future periods if we were to conclude that a future write down of our goodwill is necessary then we would record the appropriate charge which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position see notes 1 – “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 3 – “goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements and “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations and if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions it would be likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we are subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure 

  

coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have subject to our selfinsured deductibles been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 52 of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 53 and 53 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies respectively for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 53 and 49 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by the same two separate insurance companies should either of these insurance companies seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result no other insurance company accounts for 5 or more of our total revenues 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and december 31 2006 we derived 6973 million or 722 6530 million or 714 and 6074 million or 702 of our commissions and fees respectively from our operations located in these states we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to clients in these states we believe the regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states currently is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in a few states we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of insurance agencies brokers and other intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets will require us to continue to implement and improve our operations financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenue profitability or productivity comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations our financial condition and cash flows 

we recently expanded our operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve profitability 

in 2008 we expanded our operations to the united kingdom this was the first time we have opened an office outside the united states in addition we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediaries business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for clients and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several states legislatures among the provisions considered for inclusion in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could result in a reduction in the demand for liability insurance policies or a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

  

profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year the aggregate of these commissions generally have accounted for 52 to 66 of the previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that will be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are all influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production the factors that cause these variations are not within our control specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in one of our quarters or years until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is initiated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the loss of any member of our senior management team particularly our chairman and chief executive officer j hyatt brown could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results 

we believe that our future success partly depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including senior management brokers and other key personnel the loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of the services of j hyatt brown our chairman and chief executive officer who beneficially owned approximately 152 of our outstanding common stock as of february 23 2008 and is key to the development and implementation of our business strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results we maintain a 5 million “key man” life insurance policy with respect to mr brown we also maintain a 20 million insurance policy on the lives of mr brown and his wife under the terms of an agreement with mr and mrs brown at the option of the brown estate we will purchase upon the death of the later to die of mr brown or his wife shares of our common stock owned by mr and mrs brown up to the maximum number that would exhaust the proceeds of the policy 

  

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at february 23 2009 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 212 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and chief executive officer and his family members which include his sons powell brown our president and barrett brown also an employee of the company beneficially owned approximately 164 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 the affairs and policies of brown  brown 

changes in the securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 has required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of that act the sec and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs and we expect these increased costs to continue for the foreseeable future these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage likewise these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 and future yearends as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 

as directed by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting while we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the sec are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap involves making estimates 

  

judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida as an insurance intermediary our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and to a lesser extent fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels in order to determine what premium to charge the insured these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by insurance carriers none of which we control 

the volume of business from new and existing insured customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues for example level rates of inflation or a continuing general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage historically our revenues have continued to grow as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 

our culture is a strong decentralized sales culture with a focus on consistent sustained growth over the long term our senior leadership group includes 12 executive officers with regional responsibility for oversight of designated operations within the company our publicly announced succession plan calls for j powell brown who currently serves as president of brown  brown inc to succeed his father j hyatt brown when he steps down from the position of chief executive officer in july 2009 the plan also envisions that mr hyatt brown will continue to serve as chairman of the board and will continue to be actively involved with acquisitions and recruitment we have increased revenues from 956 million in 1993 as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 9776 million in 2008 a compound annual growth rate of 168 in the same period we increased net income from 80 million as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 1661 million in 2008 a compound annual growth rate of 224 from 1993 through 2006 excluding the historical impact of poolings our pretax margins income before income taxes and minority interest divided by total revenues improved in all but one year and in that year the pretax margin was essentially flat these improvements resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business revenues generated by acquisitions and continued operating efficiencies 

the past two years have posed significant challenges for us and for our industry in the form of a prevailing decline in insurance premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” increased significant governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace resulting in a substantial loss of revenues for us and in the second half of 2008 increased pressure on the values of insurable exposure units as the consequence of the general weakening of the economy in the united states while insurance premium rates declined during most of 2008 in most lines of coverage the rate of the decline seemed to slow in the second half of the year there were however indications during this same period that insurable exposure units such as sales and payroll expenditures were also declining in 2009 continued declining exposure units are likely to have a greater negative impact on our commissions and fees revenues than will any declining insurance premium rates 

beginning in the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2008 we experienced negative internal revenue growth each quarter due primarily to the “soft market” and in the second half of 2008 due to the decline in insurable exposure units which further reduced our commissions and fees revenues part of the decline in 2007 was the result of the increased governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace as described below in “the florida insurance overview” one industry segment that was hit especially hard during these years was the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent nevada arizona and florida we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents both of these operations’ revenues were negatively affected by these national economic trends throughout 2008 during 2008 the “soft market” conditions continued in most parts of the united states but were more prevalent in the southeast and southwest regions of the country 

we experienced increased overall revenue growth in these years which was primarily attributable to our acquisition in 2008 of 45 agency entities and several books of business customer accounts that generated total annualized revenues of approximately 1202 million and our acquisition in 2007 of 41 agency entities and several books of businesses that generated total annualized revenues of approximately 1083 million additionally in 2007 we sold our investment in rocktenn company which had been held for more than 25 years at a gain of 187 million 

  

in 2006 the insurance premium rates increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states as a result of the significant losses incurred by insurance carriers in the aftermath of the third quarter of 2005 in which the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded in the other regions of the united states the insurance premium rates in general declined during 2006 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on underwriting results and other aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 61 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are typically included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered recently six national insurance companies announced the replacement of the current lossratio based profitsharing contingent commission calculation with a more guaranteed fixedbased methodology referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gsc” since these new gsc are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written as of december 31 2008 134 million was earned from gsc during 2008 most of this total will not be collected until the first quarter of 2009 as of december 31 2007 66 million was earned from gsc during 2007 

fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services and 2 our wholesale brokerage and national program divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees represented 137 in 2008 143 in 2007 and 141 in 2006 

investment income historically consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities as a result of the bank liquidity and solvency issues in the united states in the last quarter of 2008 we moved substantial amounts of our cash into noninterest bearing checking accounts so that they would be fully insured by the federal depository insurance corporation “fdic” or into moneymarket investment funds a portion of which recently became fdic insured of suntrust and wells fargo two large national banks investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments in 2007 we sold our investment in rocktenn company for a net gain of 187 million 

florida insurance overview 

many states have established “residual markets” which are governmental or quasigovernmental insurance facilities that provide coverage to individuals andor businesses that cannot buy insurance in the private marketplace ie “insurers of last resort” these facilities can be for any type of risk or exposure however the most common are usually automobile or highrisk property coverage residual markets can also be referred to as fair plans windstorm pools joint underwriting associations or may even be given names styled after the private sector like “citizens property insurance corporation” 

in august 2002 the florida legislature created “citizens property insurance corporation” “citizens” to be the “insurer of last resort” in florida and citizens therefore charged insurance rates that were higher than those prevailing in the general private insurance marketplace in each of 2004 and 2005 four major hurricanes made landfall in florida and as a result of the significant insurance property losses the insurance rates increased in 2006 to counter the increased property insurance rates the state of florida instructed citizens to essentially cut its property insurance rates in half beginning in january 2007 by state law citizens has guaranteed these rates through january 1 2010 therefore citizens became one of the most if not the most competitive riskbearers for a large percentage of the commercial habitational coastal property exposures such as condominiums apartments and certain assisted living facilities additionally citizens became the only insurance market for certain homeowner policies throughout florida by the end of 2007 and throughout 2008 citizens was one of the largest underwriters of coastal property exposures in florida 

since citizens became the principal direct competitor of the insurance carriers that underwrite the condominium program administered by florida intracoastal underwriters “fiu” one of our indirect subsidiaries and the excess and surplus lines insurers represented by our wholesale brokers such as hull  company another of our subsidiaries these operations suffered the largest amount of revenue loss to citizens during 2007 during 2008 fiu’s revenues were relatively flat and therefore citizens’ impact was not as dramatic as in 2007 however citizens continued to be very competitive against the excess and surplus lines insurers and therefore significantly negatively affected the revenues of our floridabased wholesale brokerage operations 

citizens’ impact on our florida retail division was less severe than on our national program and wholesale brokerage divisions because to our retail offices citizens represents another riskbearer with which to write business although at slightly lower commission rates and greater difficulty in placing coverage citizens’ rates for 2009 will remain relatively unchanged however it is expected that citizens’ rates will increase by approximately 10 effective january 1 2010 

  

current year company overview 

for the second consecutive year we recorded negative internal revenue growth of our commissions and fees revenues as a direct result of the continuing “soft market” the competitiveness of citizens and the general weakness of the economy in the second half of 2008 our total commissions and fees revenues excluding the effect of recent acquisitions profitsharing contingencies and sales of books of businesses over the last twelve months had a negative internal growth rate of 55 offsetting the negative internal growth rate was our best year of acquisitions in terms of number of transactions during 2008 we completed 62 transactions with estimated annual revenues of 1202 million 

during 2008 investment income and other income were substantially less than in 2007 mainly due to the fact that we had more infrequent gain transactions in 2007 

during 2007 in addition to the 187 million gain on the sale of our investment in rocktenn company we recognized 135 million in gains on the sales of various books of business customer accounts additionally we settled an ongoing internal revenue service “irs” examination of our tax years 20042006 for 11 million in interest payments 

acquisitions 

approximately 15000 independent insurance agencies are estimated to currently exist in the united states part of our continuing business strategy is to attract highquality insurance agencies to join our operations from 1993 through 2008 we acquired 323 insurance intermediary operations including acquired books of business customer accounts that had aggregate estimated annual revenues of 8625 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition a summary of our acquisitions over the last three years is as follows 

 

 results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

   

commissions and fees 

commissions and fees revenue including profitsharing contingent commissions increased 56 in 2008 58 in 2007 and 115 in 2006 profitsharing contingent commissions decreased 12 million to 564 million in 2008 primarily due to higher loss ratios and therefore lower profitability for insurance carriers profitsharing contingent commissions increased 166 million to 576 million in 2007 primarily as a result of a betterthanaverage year for insurance companies’ loss ratios core commissions and fees revenue decreased 55 in 2008 and 34 in 2007 and increased 40 in 2006 when excluding commissions and fees revenue generated from acquired operations and also from divested operations the 2008 decrease of 55 represents 467 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 310 million is related to our retail wholesale and services operations based in florida the remaining decrease in our nonflorida retail and wholesale brokerage operations in 2008 was 323 million but that was substantially offset by strong revenue growth of 148 million in proctor financial a subsidiary that provides lenderplaced insurance coverage the 2007 decrease of 34 represents 279 million of net lost core commissions and fees revenue of which 230 million is related to our operations affected by the florida insurance marketplace and 62 million is related to our subsidiary that serves the homebuilding industry in southern california 

investment income 

investment income decreased to 61 million in 2008 compared with 305 million in 2007 and 115 million in 2006 the decrease in 2008 from 2007 of 244 million was primarily due to the sale of our investment in rocktenn company which had been held for more than 25 years for a net gain of 187 million the remaining 57 million decrease in investment income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields 

other income net 

other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets in 2008 gains of 10 million were recognized from sales of books of business customer accounts as compared with 137 million and 11 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively although we are not in the business of selling books of business we periodically will sell an office or a book of business that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 94 or 417 million in 2008 of which 468 million was related to acquisitions that were standalone offices of the remaining net 51 million decrease from the offices in existence in both 2008 and 2007 including the new acquisitions that folded into those offices the major decreases were primarily related to producer commissions and bonuses of 107 million offset by an increase in compensation of new salaried producers of 49 million employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 97 in 2007 and 80 in 2006 primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid on net new business employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues represented 463 in 2007 and 461 in 2006 reflecting a slight increase due to acquisitions we had 5398 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2008 compared with 5047 at december 31 2007 and 4733 at december 31 2006 of the 351 net increase in fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2008 over the prior yearend 489 were from the acquisitions that continued as standalone offices thus reflecting a net reduction of 138 employees in the offices existing at both yearends 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards to its employees effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” for its stockbased compensation plans among other things sfas 123r requires that compensation expense for all sharebased awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

for 2008 2007 and 2006 the noncash stockbased compensation under sfas 123r incorporates costs related to each of our three stockbased plans as explained in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

noncash stockbased compensation increased 291 or 16 million in 2008 as a result of new performance stock plan “psp” shares and incentive stock options “iso” granted primarily in february 2008 prior to the february 2008 grants the last major grant of psp and iso shares occurred in january 2003 we do not expect another major grant of psp or iso shares until the later of the date that the company’s stock price approaches 3700 per share or five years from february 2008 however we will continue to grant additional psp shares to producers who increase their existing books of business key personnel who are new to the company and key employees who take on additional responsibilities within the company 

  

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses represented 141 in 2008 137 in 2007 and 144 in 2006 other operating expenses in 2008 increased 60 million over 2007 of which 122 million was related to acquisitions that joined as standalone offices the remaining net 62 million decrease from the offices in existence in both 2008 and 2007 including the new acquisitions that “folded into” those offices were broadbased reductions relating to supplies telephone insurance legal and claims expenses other operating expenses in 2007 increased 49 million over the 2006 amount which included a onetime 58 million payment to the state of florida described below an effective increase in cost of 107 million the intermediaries acquired in 2007 that were not combined with existing company offices and remained as standalone offices accounted for 111 million of the 107 million net increase thus excluding the effects of acquisitions the 2007 other operating expenses were slightly lower in 2007 than 2006 

in 2006 legal and professional fee expenses increased 17 million over the amount expended in 2005 this increase was primarily due to the costs associated with investigations and litigation relating to agent and broker compensation including profitsharing contingent commissions by state regulators and to a lesser extent the costs of compliance with certain requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 additionally in 2006 a total of 58 million was paid to state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties which concluded the state of florida’s investigation of compensation paid to us 

amortization 

amortization expense increased 62 million or 153 in 2008 39 million or 108 in 2007 and 33 million or 98 in 2006 the increases in 2008 and 2007 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation increased 41 in 2008 129 in 2007 and 124 in 2006 these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computers related equipment and software corporate aircraft and the depreciation of fixed assets associated with acquisitions completed in those years 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 09 million or 64 in 2008 over 2007 primarily as a result of the additional 250 million that was borrowed in february 2008 interest expense increased 04 million or 33 in 2007 over 2006 as a result of the additional 250 million that was borrowed in december 2006 but which was partially offset by the 129 million reduction in the term loan balance due to the normal quarterly principal payments 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 390 in 2008 387 in 2007 and 385 in 2006 the higher effective tax rate in 2008 and 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily the result of reduced benefits from taxexempt interest income increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates and a 11 million settlement payment to the us internal revenue service “irs” in 2007 during 2007 the irs concluded its audit of our 20042006 tax years in which it disputed our method of recognizing profitsharing contingent commissions for tax purposes we recognize profitsharing contingent commissions when determinable which is when such commissions are received however the irs believes that we should estimate those amounts as of each december 31 we agreed to resolve this dispute for a 11 million payment of interest and our agreement to accrue at each december 31 for tax purposes only a known amount of profitsharing contingent commissions represented by the actual amount of profitsharing contingent commissions received in the first quarter of the related year with a trueup adjustment to the actual amount received by the following march 31 because this method now required for tax purposes differs from the method used for book purposes it will result in a current deferred tax asset as of december 31 each year which will be reversed by the following march 31 when the related profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized for financial accounting purposes 

  

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate four reportable segments or divisions the retail wholesale brokerage national programs and services divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses are the result of acquisitions within a given division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management places emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues

retail division 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers approximately 960 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue is commissionbased because most of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions net of related compensation that we receive will be reflected in our pretax income 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the retail division’s total revenues in 2008 increased 278 million to 5902 million a 49 increase over 2007 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2008 decreased 75 million from 2007 primarily due to increased loss ratios resulting in lower profitability for insurance carriers in 2007 approximately 457 million of the change in the retail division’s total revenues was due to net growth in core commissions and fees however 921 million was from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2007 therefore after removing the revenue from acquisitions from the calculation 347 million was lost on a “samestore sales” basis resulting in a negative internal growth rate of 69 most of the negative internal growth resulted from continued competitive insurance pricing primarily in florida additionally even though there are signs that declines in insurance rates are slowing the second half of 2008 was marked by indications of additional slowing of the economy which resulted in a reduction in insurable exposure units for 2009 the slowing economy will most likely have a greater impact on the premium volume of our customers than will the insurance premium rates 

income before income taxes in 2008 decreased 207 million from 2007 of which 111 million was primarily attributable to a historically high amount of gains from the sales of books of business customer accounts in 2007 the remaining decrease of 96 million was due to reduced profit sharing contingent commissions and to reduced earnings from core commissions and fees offset by earnings from acquisitions 

the retail division’s total revenues in 2007 increased 444 million to 5624 million an 86 increase over 2006 of this increase approximately 341 million was attributable to the net growth in core commissions and fees however 444 million was from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2006 and therefore 103 million was lost on a “samestore sales” basis resulting in a negative internal growth rate of 21 most of the negative internal growth resulted from continued competitive insurance pricing in the western united states however some of the most competitive pricing in the second half of 2007 year occurred in florida 

  

income before income taxes in 2007 increased 136 million from 2006 of which 137 million was from a historically high amount of gains from sales of books of business customer accounts even though the sales of customer accounts were higher than normal during 2007 we do not believe that this is indicative of a future trend the remaining decrease was due to the reduced earnings from core commissions and fees which were partially offset by earnings from acquisitions 

wholesale brokerage division 

the wholesale brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance and reinsurance primarily through independent agents and brokers like the retail and national programs divisions the wholesale brokerage division’s revenues are primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our wholesale brokerage division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the wholesale brokerage division’s total revenues in 2008 decreased 83 million from 2007 of which 69 million was attributable to the reduction in core commissions and fees revenues and 15 million was attributable to the reduction in investment income of the net decrease in core commissions and fees of 69 million approximately 162 million related to core commissions and fees revenues from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2007 the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenues in 2008 was 146 or 229 million less in revenues than in 2007 excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in 2008 from new acquisitions the negative internal growth rate for the division was the result of lost revenues from nearly every one of our wholesale brokerage operations including our reinsurance intermediary axiom re in the competitive soft market of 2008 not only did insurance premium rates continue to drop but standard admitted insurance carriers continued to pursue accounts in classes of business that would have been forced to go to excess and surplus lines market via wholesale brokers because coverage would not have been available in the standard admitted markets additionally our floridabased wholesale brokerage operations lost 33 million of revenue in 2008 as a result of the continued competitive rate environment created primarily by citizens in 2009 if the standard insurance carriers begin to restrict their appetite for the more nonstandard type of insurance risk some of that business may begin to flow back into the excess and surplus lines marketplace via our wholesale brokers if this were to happen it would probably not occur before the second half of 2009 

income before income taxes in 2008 decreased 104 million to 176 million a 371 decrease from 2007 this decrease is due primarily to net lost business lower investment income and an increase in other operating expenses primarily from data processing bad debts rent and telephone expenses 

  

total revenues in 2007 increased 156 million over 2006 of which 103 million was from increased profitsharing contingent commissions and 57 million from core commissions and fees profitsharing contingent commissions increased as a result of higher insurance company profitability resulting from increased premium rates during 2006 as well as new profitsharing contingent commissions received by operations acquired in 2006 of the net increase in core commissions and fees of 57 million approximately 152 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenue in 2006 the wholesale brokerage division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue in 2007 was 63 or 95 million less in revenue than in 2006 excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in 2007 from new acquisitions the negative internal growth rate for the wholesale brokerage division was primarily the result of the continuation of lost revenues from the same wholesale operations that had the most significant loss of revenues in 2006 one of those operations which focuses on homebuilding construction accounts in the western united states lost 62 million as a result of the continued slowdown in economic activity in that region during the year in combination with lower insurance premium rates the other significantly affected operation was our floridabased wholesale brokerage subsidiary of hull  company which lost 58 million of revenue in 2007 as a result of the competitive rate environment created by citizens conversely the revenues generated by our binding authority operations and our reinsurance intermediary axiom re increased in 2007 

income before income taxes in 2007 increased 11 million to 280 million a 42 increase over 2006 this increase is attributable in part to the fact that the 2007 loss from our reinsurance intermediary was 21 million less than in 2006 and to higher earnings generated by our binding authority operations mainly in the form of higher profitsharing contingent commissions offsetting these increases our operation that focuses on homebuilding construction accounts in the western region of the united states earned 29 million less income before income taxes than it earned in 2006 due principally to the reduction in revenues mentioned above 

  

national programs division 

the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and special programs which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups public and quasipublic entities and market niches like the retail division and the wholesale brokerage division the national programs division’s revenues are primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the national programs division’s total revenues in 2008 increased 207 million to 1783 million a 132 increase over 2007 profitsharing contingent commissions in 2008 increased 61 million from 2007 primarily due to the improved profitability of the insurance carriers during calendar year 2007 of the 148 million increase in core commissions and fees revenues only approximately 07 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2007 the national programs division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 95 excluding core commissions and fees revenues recognized in 2008 from new acquisitions the majority of the internally generated growth in the 2008 core commissions and fees revenues was primarily related to 148 million of net new business written in our proctor financial subsidiary that provides lenderplaced insurance additionally our professional liability programs generated net new business of approximately 16 million our condominium program at florida intracoastal underwriters “fiu” was flat and our public entity business lost approximately 16 million of core commissions and fees revenues mainly due to premium rate reductions 

income before income taxes in 2008 increased 162 million to 633 million a 343 increase over 2007 most of this increase is attributable to increased profitsharing contingent commissions and the net new business generated by our subsidiary that specializes in lenderplaced insurance 

total revenues in 2007 were essentially flat compared with 2006 due to the netting of different programs some of which had very good growth and another of which lost nearly half of its revenues in 2007 approximately 58 million related to core commissions and fees revenues from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2006 the national programs division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenues was 56 representing 87 million of lost revenues excluding core commissions and fees revenues recognized in 2007 and attributable to new acquisitions as previously discussed when citizens began to compete aggressively in florida on january 1 2007 it had a significant impact on the condominium 

  

program administered by our fiu subsidiary in 2007 fiu lost 134 million of the 272 million of total core commissions and fees that it had earned in 2006 most of our other programs including our lawyers and dental professional liability programs our public entity business our sports and entertainment programs and our operation that provides lenderplaced insurance had positive internal growth 

income before income taxes in 2007 decreased only 14 million from 2006 however excluding the 30 million portion of the 58 million paid to the state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties in 2006 that was allocated to national programs the net decrease was 44 million of that decrease 107 million was attributable to fiu this amount was somewhat offset by increased earnings from 2007 acquisitions and from the programs that experienced positive internal growth in 2007 

  

services division 

the services division provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration “tpa” and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services unlike our other segments approximately 989 of the services division’s 2008 commissions and fees revenue is generated from fees which are not significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums 

financial information relating to our services division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 the services division’s total revenues in 2008 decreased 32 million from 2007 of this decrease 42 million related to a loss of business beginning in september 2007 when one of our largest clients transferred the bulk of its claimspaying services inhouse which resulted in a revenue reduction of approximately 400000 per month through august 2008 partially offsetting this decrease in revenues was 10 million of net new business growth generated by our medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services 

income before income taxes in 2008 decreased 15 million from 2007 primarily due to the loss of 42 million of workers’ compensation claims business which was partially offset by the transfer of approximately 23 million of the related ongoing annual claimspaying costs 

total revenues in 2007 increased 28 million over 2006 of which approximately 23 million related to core commissions and fees revenues from an acquisition for which there were no comparable revenues in 2006 the services division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenues was 19 in 2007 excluding the 2006 core commissions and fees revenues from acquisitions and divested business the positive net internal growth rates from core commissions and fees revenues primarily reflect the net new business growth from our subsidiary that specializes in medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services the commissions and fees generated by our workers’ compensation and public and quasipublic entity tpa business were essentially flat in 2007 compared with 2006 

income before income taxes in 2007 increased 07 million over 2006 primarily due to strong net new business growth in our subsidiary that specializes in medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services

as discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the “other” column in the segment information table includes any income and expenses not allocated to reportable segments and corporaterelated items including the intercompany interest expense charges to reporting segments during 2007 we sold all of our shares of rocktenn company and recorded a total gain of 187 million

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities the “current ratio” was 100 and 106 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

contractual cash obligations 

as of december 31 2008 our contractual cash obligations were as follows 

 

 debt 

in july 2004 the company completed a private placement of 2000 million of unsecured senior notes the “notes” the 2000 million is divided into two series series a for 1000 million due in 2011 and bearing interest at 557 per year and series b for 1000 million due in 2014 and bearing interest at 608 per year the closing on the series b notes occurred on july 15 2004 the closing on the series a notes occurred on september 15 2004 brown  brown has used the proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and repayment of existing debt as of december 31 2008 and 2007 there was an outstanding balance of 2000 million on the notes 

on december 22 2006 the company entered into a master shelf and note purchase agreement the “master agreement” with a national insurance company the “purchaser” the purchaser also purchased notes issued by the company in 2004 the master agreement provides for a 2000 million private uncommitted “shelf” facility for the issuance of senior unsecured notes over a threeyear period with interest rates that may be fixed or floating and with such maturity dates not to exceed ten 10 years as the parties may determine the master agreement includes various covenants limitations and events of default similar to the notes issued in 2004 the initial issuance of notes under the master agreement occurred on december 22 2006 through the issuance of 250 million in series c senior notes due december 22 2016 with a fixed interest rate of 566 per annum on february 1 2008 250 million in series d senior notes due january 15 2015 with a fixed interest rate of 537 per annum were issued as of december 31 2008 there was an outstanding balance of 500 million under the master agreement 

  

on june 12 2008 the company entered into an amended and restated revolving loan agreement the “loan agreement” with a national banking institution that was dated as of june 3 2008 amending and restating the existing revolving loan agreement dated september 29 2003 as amended the “revolving agreement” in order to increase the lending commitment to 500 million subject to potential increases up to 1000 million and to extend the maturity date from december 20 2011 to june 3 2013 the revolving agreement initially provided for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of 750 million after a series of amendments that provided covenant exceptions for the notes issued or to be issued under the master agreement and relaxed or deleted certain other covenants the maximum principal amount was reduced to 200 million the calculation of interest and fees is generally based on the company’s quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stockbased compensation interest is charged at a rate equal to 050 to 100 above the london interbank offering rate “libor” or 100 below the base rate each as more fully defined in the loan agreement fees include an upfront fee an availability fee of 010 to 020 and a letter of credit usage fee of 050 to 100 the loan agreement contains various covenants limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers the 90day libor was 1425 and 470 as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively there were no borrowings against this facility at december 31 2008 or 2007 

in january 2001 brown  brown entered into a 900 million unsecured sevenyear term agreement with a national banking institution bearing an interest rate based upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus 050 to 100 depending upon brown  brown’s quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stockbased compensation the 90day libor was 470 as of december 31 2007 the loan was fully funded on january 3 2001 and was to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of 3200000 through december 2007 as of december 31 2007 the outstanding balance had been paid in full 

all four of these credit agreements require or required brown  brown to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants brown  brown was in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2008 and 2007 

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our master agreement and the loan agreement described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2009 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototalcapitalization ratio we would have the ability to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1—summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later at that date the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification concerning matters necessitating such adjustments from the insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received from insurance companies or when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

  

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” 

intangible assets impairment 

effective january 1 2002 we adopted sfas no 142 which requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvaluebased test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset sfas no 142 requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of revenues earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and the related discounted cash flows 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and assesses the recoverability of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2008 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards previously referred to as “restricted stock” to its employees effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” for its stockbased compensation plans among other things sfas 123r requires that compensation expense for all sharebased awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

litigation claims 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inhouse and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income 

  

derivative instruments 

in 2002 we entered into one derivative financial instrument—an interest rate exchange agreement or “swap”—to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our 90 million variable rate debt as of december 31 2006 we maintained this swap agreement whereby we paid a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank paid us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base london interbank offering rate “libor” we assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in the fair market value of the swap were reflected in other comprehensive income the fair market value of this instrument was determined by quotes obtained from the related counterparties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows the valuation of this derivative instrument was a significant estimate that was largely affected by changes in interest rates as of december 31 2007 this interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with the final payment on the related 90 million variable rate debt

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line and term loan agreements 

our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments and certificates of deposit at december 31 2008 and 2007 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date as of december 31 2006 our largest security investment was 559970 common stock shares of rocktenn company a new york stock exchange listed company which had been held for more than 25 years our investment in rocktenn company accounted for 81 of the total value of our availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit as of december 31 2006 in 2007 we sold our investment in rocktenn company for a net gain of 187 million as of december 31 2007 we had no remaining shares of rocktenn company and thus have no current exposure to equity price risk relating to the common stock of rocktenn company 

to hedge the risk of rising interest rates from january 2 2002 through the remaining six years of our sevenyear 90 million term loan on december 5 2001 we entered into an interest rate exchange or “swap” agreement that effectively converted the floating rate interest payments based on libor to fixed interest rate payments at 453 this agreement did not impact or change the required 050 to 100 credit risk spread portion of the term loan we do not otherwise enter into derivatives swaps or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes as of december 31 2007 the interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with the final principal payment on the term loan

we carried out an evaluation required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act the “evaluation” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” as of december 31 2008 based on the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our senior management including our ceo and cfo to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

in conducting brown  brown’s evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting brown  brown has excluded the following acquisitions completed by brown  brown during 2008 huntsmithpeabody insurance agency inc ldp consulting group inc w j fowler  company powers  effler insurance brokers inc big sky underwriters inc nathan stone insurance agency inc debock  muth insurance agency inc dill joyce  thresher incorporated hba insurance group inc alpha benefits group inc fullerton  company inc burt  associates benefit planning inc reed brothers insurance group inc agency associates inc and gallagher associates inc collectively these acquisitions represented 179 and 117 of our net assets and total assets as of december 31 2008 respectively and 55 of our total revenue and 57 of our net income for the year ended december 31 2008 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on brown  brown’s consolidated financial statements 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2008 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

ceo and cfo certifications 

exhibits 311 and 312 are the certifications of the ceo and the cfo respectively the certifications are required in accordance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “section 302 certifications” this item of this report which you are currently reading is the information concerning the evaluation referred to in the section 302 certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and by fees paid by customers for certain services the commission is usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature 

of the services provided by us in some cases a commission is shared with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “profitsharing contingent commission” which is a profitsharing commission based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services and 2 our wholesale brokerage and national program divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers the amount of our revenue from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units 

as of december 31 2007 our activities were conducted in 198 locations in 38 states as follows 

 industry overview 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting riskbearing industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance the premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance companies from these hurricanes the insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states the insurance premium rates in general declined during 2006 in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in the state of florida as discussed below the insurance premium rates continued a gradual decline during 2007 in most of the other regions of the united states one industry segment that was especially hit hard during 2007 was the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent nevada arizona and florida we have a wholesale brokerage operation 

that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents both of these operations’ revenues were significantly impacted by these national economic trends 

florida insurance overview 

many states have established “residual markets” which are governmental or quasigovernmental insurance facilities that provide coverage to individuals andor businesses which cannot buy insurance in the private marketplace ie “insurers of last resort” these facilities can be for any type of risk or exposure however the most common are usually automobile or highrisk property coverage residual markets can also be referred to as fair plans windstorm pools joint underwriting associations or may even be given names styled after the private sector like “citizens property insurance corporation” 

in august 2002 the florida legislature created “citizens property insurance corporation” “citizens” to be the “insurer of last resort” in florida and therefore charged insurance rates that were higher than the general private insurance marketplace in each of 2004 and 2005 four major hurricanes made landfall in florida and as a result of the significant insurance property losses the insurance rates increased in 2006 to counter the increased property insurance rates the state of florida instructed citizens to essentially cut their property insurance rates in half beginning in january 2007 by state law citizens has guaranteed their rates through january 1 2009 therefore citizens became the most competitive riskbearer on commercial habitational coastal property exposures such as condominiums apartments and certain assisted living facilities additionally citizens became the only insurance market for certain homeowner policies throughout florida by the end of 2007 citizens was the largest single underwriter of coastal property in florida 

since citizens became the main direct competitor against the riskbearer of our florida intercoastal underwriters “fiu” condominium program and the excess and surplus lines insurers represented by our wholesale brokerage segment such as our hull  company subsidiary these programs suffered the largest amount of revenue loss to citizens during 2007 citizens’ impact on our florida retail division was less than on our national program and wholesale brokerage divisions because to our retail offices citizens was now simply another riskbearer with which to write business although at slightly lower commission rates and a greater difficulty in placing coverage for 2008 the insurance rates charged by citizens are expected to be similar to their 2007 rates and therefore the sequential year impact of citizens’ rates may not be as significant as they were on our 2007 results 

in the second half of 2007 the standard insurance companies started to become more competitive in the casualty liability business including workers’ compensation business the rates in the florida casualty business began to reduce as much as 2025 compared with 2006 rates these competitive rates are likely to continue for at least the first half of 2008 

current year company overview 

for us 2007 was a year unlike any previous ones for the first time since we began tracking internal revenue growth rates in 1997 we completed the year with a negative internal growth rate last year also consisted of four straight quarters of negative internal growth our total commissions and fees decreased 279 million or 34 in 2007 and this decrease is primarily attributed to the continued “soft” insurance marketplace in the united states the governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace and the negative impact of the economy on the homebuilding industry offsetting the negative internal revenue growth was a very successful year of 41 acquisitions including books of business with estimated annual revenues of 1083 million of which 677 million is reflected in our 2007 revenues 

during 2007 we also recorded an 187 million gain on the sale of our investment in rocktenn company which we owned for over 25 years additionally during the year we recognized 135 million in gains on the sale of various books of business customer accounts the sales of these accounts were related to individual circumstances in various offices and are not indicative of any expected trends finally we settled an ongoing internal revenue service “irs” examination of our tax years 20042006 for the payment of 11 million in interest 

business combinations 

beginning in 1993 through 2007 we acquired 278 insurance intermediary operations including acquired books of business customer accounts that had aggregate estimated annual revenues of 7423 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition of these 41 operations were acquired during 2007 with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 1083 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisitions and 32 operations were acquired during 2006 with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 564 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition during 2005 32 operations were acquired with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 1259 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition

     8 

        services division 

at december 31 2007 our services division employed 266 persons and provided the following services 1 insurancerelated services including comprehensive risk management and thirdparty administration “tpa” services for insurance entities and selffunded or fullyinsured workers’ compensation and liability plans 2 comprehensive medical utilization management services for both workers’ compensation and alllines liability insurance plans and 3 medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services 

the services division’s workers’ compensation and liability plan tpa services include claims administration access to major reinsurance markets cost containment consulting services for secondary disability and subrogation recoveries and risk management services such as loss control in 2007 our three largest workers’ compensation contracts represented approximately 315 of our services division’s fees revenue or approximately 12 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in addition the services division provides managed care services including medical networks case management and utilization review services certified by the american accreditation health care commission 

employees 

at december 31 2007 we had 5047 fulltime equivalent employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our insured customers and employees after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our insured customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price there are a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence that compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere this situation is particularly pronounced outside of florida 

a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct writing has had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially rather than individually oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may experience further consolidation which in turn has resulted and could further result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents brokers or thirdparty administrators by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors 

as referenced this annual report on form 10k includes certain forwardlooking statements regarding various matters the ultimate correctness of those forwardlooking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be different from those expressed or implied by those statements undue reliance should not be placed on those forwardlooking statements the following important factors among others as well as those factors set forth in our other sec filings from time to time could affect future results and events causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing brown  brown inc and its subsidiaries additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or otherwise may also impair our business operations 

we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

we are primarily engaged in insurance agency and wholesale brokerage activities and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 general premium levels were depressed as a result of the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance companies and increased competition in many cases insurance companies lowered commission rates and increased volume requirements significant reductions in premium rates occurred during the years 1986 through 1999 as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus loss adjustment expenses against earned premiums experience by insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2004 there was a rapid transition as previously stable or increasing rates fell in most markets these rate declines were most pronounced in the property and casualty market with rates falling between 10 and 30 by yearend rate declines continued on a moderated basis through 2006 with the exception of premium rates on coastal property which increased in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in the state of florida the insurance premium rates continued a gradual decline during 2007 in most of the other regions of the united states one industry segment that was especially hit hard during 2007 was the homebuilding industry in southern california and to a lesser extent nevada arizona and florida we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focuses on placing property and casualty insurance products for that homebuilding segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents both of these operations’ revenues were significantly impacted by these national economic trends 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and potential related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities and a related derivative demand from counsel for a purported shareholder which could result in a purported derivative action based on claimed improprieties in the manner in which we are compensated by insurance companies the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices the derivative demand or the responses by the market and government regulators any unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations and if such resolution included a material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions it would be likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we may be subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have subject to our selfinsured deductibles been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from two insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 53 and 53 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies respectively for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 53 and 49 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance 

policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 80 and 54 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies respectively should either of these insurance companies seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result no other insurance company accounts for 5 or more of our total revenues 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida georgia michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida georgia michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania texas and washington for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and december 31 2005 we derived 6774 million or 741 6400 million or 740 and 5897 million or 760 of our commissions and fees from our operations located in these states respectively we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to clients in these states we believe the regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states currently is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in a few states we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermedaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of insurance agencies brokers and other intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets will require us to continue to implement and improve our operations financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenue profitability or productivity comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities that have substantially greater resources than we do acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of management’s attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations our financial condition and cash flows 

we are expanding our operations internationally which may result in a number of additional risks and require more management time and expense than our domestic operations to achieve profitablity 

we are planning to expand our operations to the united kingdom which will be the first time we’ve operated outside the united states in addition we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

    13 

      our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediaries business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for clients and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several states legislatures among the provisions considered for inclusion in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could result in a reduction in the demand for liability insurance policies or a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

we compete in a highlyregulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in california and certain other states these state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus further state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the 

enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions paid by insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability volume andor growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year the aggregate of these commissions generally have accounted for 52 to 66 of the previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year because profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that will be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are all influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions and override commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production the factors that cause these variations are not within our control specifically customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in one of our quarters or years until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our future earnings and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stock’s market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts’ earnings and other expectations and any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stock’s market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies’ securities if any such litigation is instigated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the loss of any member of our senior management team particularly our chairman and chief executive officer j hyatt brown could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results 

we believe that our future success partly depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including senior management brokers and other key personnel the loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of the services of j hyatt brown our chairman and chief executive officer who beneficially owned approximately 153 of our outstanding common stock as of february 23 2008 and is key to the development and implementation of our business strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results we maintain a 5 million “key man” life insurance policy with respect to mr brown we also maintain a 20 million insurance policy on the lives of mr brown and his wife under the terms of an agreement with mr and mrs brown at the option of the brown estate we will purchase upon the death of the later to die of mr brown or his wife shares of our common stock owned by mr and mrs brown up to the maximum number that would exhaust the proceeds of the policy 

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company 

at february 23 2008 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 205 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and chief executive officer and his family members which include his sons powell brown our president and barrett brown also an employee of the company beneficially owned approximately 17 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 the affairs and policies of brown  brown 

changes in the securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 has required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of that act the securities and exchange commission “sec” and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs and we expect these increased costs to continue for the foreseeable future these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage likewise these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 and future yearends as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 

as directed by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting while we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap in the united states of america any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the securities and exchange commission are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report all share and per share information has been restated to give effect to a twoforone common stock split that became effective november 28 2005 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida since 1993 our stated corporate objective has been to increase our net income per share by at least 15 every year we have increased revenues from 956 million in 1993 as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 9597 million in 2007 a compound annual growth rate of 179 in the same period we increased net income from 80 million as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 1910 million in 2007 a compound annual growth rate of 254 since 1993 excluding the historical impact of poolings our pretax margins income before income taxes and minority interest divided by total revenues improved in all but one year and in that year the pretax margin was essentially flat these improvements have resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business revenues generated by acquisitions continued operating efficiencies and for 2007 the sale of our investment in rocktenn company unlike our prior year’s results our revenue growth in 2007 was driven primarily by the acquisition of 41 agency entities and several books of business customer accounts generating total annualized revenues of approximately 1083 million 

our commissions and fees revenue is comprised of commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels so as to determine what premium to charge the insured these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by insurance carriers none of which we control 

beginning in 1986 and continuing through 1999 commission revenues were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting from intense competition among property and casualty insurance companies for market share this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” generally resulted in flat to reduced commissions on renewal business the effect of this softness in rates on our commission revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and net new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to decline and in certain lines of insurance premium rates decreased 

in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance carriers as the result of these hurricanes the insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states the insurance premium rates in general declined during 2006 

in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in the state of florida as previously discussed the insurance premium rates continued a gradual decline during 2007 in most of the other regions of the united states one industry segment that was especially hit hard during 2007 was the home building industry in southern california and to a lesser extent nevada arizona and florida we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focus on placing property and casualty insurance products for that home building segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents both of these operations’ revenues were negatively impacted by these national economic trends 

the volume of business from new and existing insured customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions further impact our revenues for example the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage conversely level rates of inflation or general declines in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units historically our revenues have continued to grow as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions however 2007 was highlighted by very substantial governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace that resulted in a substantial loss of revenues see the “business” section of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of citizens and its effect on our results of operations we anticipate that results of operations will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions in 2007 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on underwriting results and other aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 58 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are primarily included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered recently three national insurance companies announced the replacement of the current lossratio based profitsharing contingent commission calculation with a more guaranteed fixedbased methodology referred to as “guaranteed supplemental commissions” “gsc” since these new gsc are not subject to the uncertainty of lossratios they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written as of december 31 2007 66 million was accrued for gsc earned during 2007 but which will not be collected until the first quarter of 2008 

fee revenues are generated primarily by 1 our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services and 2 our wholesale brokerage and national program divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers in each of the past three years fee revenues have increased as a percentage of our total commissions and fees from 136 in 2005 to 143 in 2007 

investment income historically consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments in 2007 we sold our investment in rocktenn company which we have owned for over 25 years for a net gain of 187 million 

acquisitions 

during 2007 we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 38 insurance intermediary operations the stock of three insurance intermediaries and several books of business customer accounts the aggregate purchase price was 2414 million including 2079 million of net cash payments the issuance of 130 million in notes payable and the assumption of 205 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 1083 million 

during 2006 we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 32 insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts the aggregate purchase price was 1559 million including 1387 million of net cash payments the issuance of 37 million in notes payable and the assumption of 135 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 564 million 

during 2005 we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 32 insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts the aggregate purchase price was 2886 million including 2440 million of net cash payments the issuance of 381 million in notes payable and the assumption of 65 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 1259 million 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1—summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later at that date the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted by known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received or when officially notified fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

business combinations and purchase price allocations 

we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts partially include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on the duration and any unique features of each specific agreement purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” 

intangible assets impairment 

effective january 1 2002 we adopted sfas no 142 which requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to lowerofcostormarket impairment testing sfas no 142 requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment 

of goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2007 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards previously referred to as “restricted stock” to its employees officers and directors effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” for its stockbased compensation plans among other things sfas 123r requires that compensation expense for all sharebased awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

reserves for litigation 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inside and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and impact our net income 

derivative instruments 

in 2002 we entered into one derivative financial instrument—an interest rate exchange agreement or “swap”—to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our 90 million variable rate debt as of december 31 2006 we maintained this swap agreement whereby we pay a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pays us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base london interbank offering rate “libor” we have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in the fair market value of the swap are reflected in other comprehensive income the fair market value of this instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counterparties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows the valuation of this derivative instrument is a significant estimate that is largely affected by changes in interest rates as of december 31 2007 this interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with the final payment on the related 90 million variable rate debt 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 commissions and fees 

commissions and fees revenue including profitsharing contingent commissions increased 58 in 2007 115 in 2006 and 215 in 2005 profitsharing contingent commissions increased 166 million to 576 million in 2007 and 61 million to 410 million in 2006 primarily as a result of a better than average year for insurance companies’ loss ratios core commissions and fees revenue decreased 34 in 2007 and increased 40 in 2006 and 31 in 2005 when excluding commissions and fees revenue generated from acquired operations and also from divested operations the 2007 decrease of 34 represents 279 million of net lost core commission and fees revenue of which 230 million is related to our various operations impacted by the florida insurance marketplace 62 million is related to our operation that serves the homebuilding industry in southern california with our remaining operations at a minimal aggregate revenue growth 

investment income 

investment income increased to 305 million in 2007 compared with 115 million in 2006 and 66 million in 2005 the increase in 2007 over 2006 of 190 million was primarily due to the sale of our investment in rocktenn company which we owned for over 25 years for a net gain of 187 million the increase in 2006 over 2005 was primarily the result of higher investment yields earned with higher average available cash balances 

other income net 

other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets in 2007 gains of 137 million were recognized from the sale of books of business customer accounts as compared with 11 million and 27 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively although we are not in the business of selling books of businesses customer accounts we periodically will sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth even though the sales of customer accounts were unusually high during 2007 we do not believe that it is indicative of a future trend 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 97 or 392 million in 2007 of which 335 million was related to acquisitions that were standalone offices of the remaining 57 million the majority related to the average annual 35 salary increase given to nonproducer employees additionally during 2007 16 million of the increase related to a funding trueup to the 2006 employee profitsharing contribution employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 80 in 2006 and 193 in 2005 primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid on net new business employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues were 461 in 2006 and 477 in 2005 reflecting a gradual improvement in personnel efficiencies as revenues grow we had 5047 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2007 compared with 4733 at december 31 2006 and 4540 at december 31 2005 of the 314 net increase in fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2007 over the prior yearend 508 were from the acquisitions that were standalone offices thus resulting in a net reduction of 194 employees in the offices existing at both yearends 

noncash stockbased compensation 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards to its employees officers and directors effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” for its stockbased compensation plans among other things sfas 123r requires that compensation expense for all sharebased awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

prior to january 1 2006 the company accounted for stockbased compensation using the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees “apb no 25” and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas 123” as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensationtransitions and disclosures “sfas 148” under apb no 25 no compensation expense was recognized for either stock options issued under the company’s stock compensation plans or for stock purchased under the company’s 1990 employee stock purchase plan “espp” the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share for stock options and espp awards were instead disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements compensation expense was previously recognized for awards of nonvested stock based upon the market value of the common stock on the date of award on a straightline basis over the requisite service period with the effect of forfeitures recognized as they occurred as such the 2005 noncash stockbased compensation expense of 33 million was solely related to the performance stock plan “psp” grants under apb 25 

for 2007 and 2006 the noncash stockbased compensation under sfas 123r incorporates costs related to each of our three stockbased plans as explained in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

since the last significant companywide grants of psp shares occurred in january 2003 and that the fiveyear period for the related shares to become “awarded” expired in january 2008 as did the “unawarded” shares we expect to grant new psp shares to deserving office leaders and producers in february 2008 additionally we may issue incentive stock options “iso” to certain corporate leaders the expected annual cost of these additional psp and iso grants is expected to be between 15 million and 25 million 

other operating expenses 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses was 137 in 2007 144 in 2006 and 134 in 2005 other operating expenses in 2007 increased 49 million over the 2006 amount which also included a onetime 58 million payment to the state of florida described below therefore having an effective increase in cost of 107 million the intermediaries acquired in 2007 that were not combined with existing company offices and became standalone offices accounted for 111 million of the 107 million net increase thus excluding the effects of acquisitions the 2007 other operating expenses were slightly less than 2006 

for 2006 legal and professional fee expenses increased 17 million over the amount expended in 2005 the increase in legal and professional fee expenses was primarily the result of the various ongoing investigations and 

litigation relating to agent and broker compensation including profitsharing contingent commissions by state regulators and to a lesser extent by the requirements of compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 additionally in 2006 a total of 58 million was paid to state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties which concluded the state of florida’s investigation of compensation paid to us see note 13 excluding the impact of these increased legal and professional fee expenses and settlement payments other operating expenses declined as a percentage of total revenues each year from 2005 to 2006 which is attributable to the effective cost containment measures brought about by our initiative designed to identify areas of excess expense this decrease is also due to the fact that in a net internal revenue growth environment certain significant other operating expenses such as office rent office supplies data processing and telephone costs increase at a slower rate than commissions and fees revenue during the same period 

amortization 

amortization expense increased 39 million or 108 in 2007 33 million or 98 in 2006 and 111 million or 501 in 2005 the increases in 2007 and 2006 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

depreciation 

depreciation increased 129 in 2007 124 in 2007 and 129 in 2005 these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computers related equipment and software corporate aircraft and the depreciation of fixed assets associated with acquisitions completed in those years 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 04 million or 33 in 2007 over 2006 primarily as a result of the additional 250 million that was borrowed in december 2006 but which was partially offset by the 129 reduction in the term loan balance due to the normal quarterly principal payments interest expense decreased 11 million or 77 in 2006 over 2005 as a result of lower average debt balances due to the normal quarterly principal payments 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 387 in 2007 385 in 2006 and 383 in 2005 the higher effective tax rate in 2007 and 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily the result of increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates and a 11 million settlement payment to the us internal revenue service “irs” in 2007 during 2007 the irs concluded their audit of our 20042006 tax years in which they disputed our method of recognizing profitsharing contingent commissions for tax purposes we recognize profitsharing contingent commissions when determinable which is when such commissions are received however the irs believes that we should estimate those monies as of each december 31 we agreed to resolve this dispute for a 11 million payment of interest and our agreement to accrue at each december 31 for tax purposes only a known amount of profitsharing contingent commissions represented by the actual amount of profitsharing contingent commissions received in the first quarter of the related year with a trueup adjustment to the actual amount received by the end of the following march 31 since this method for tax purposes differs from the method used for book purposes it will result in a current deferred tax asset as of december 31 each year with that balance reversing by the following march 31 when the related profitsharing contingent commissions are recognized for financial accounting purposes 

results of operations — segment information 

as discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate in four reportable segments the retail wholesale brokerage national programs and services divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses are the result of acquisitions within a given division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management places emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues

  retail division 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic professional and individual insured customers more than 961 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue are commissionbased since the majority of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions that we receive will be reflected in our pretax income the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue accounted for 631 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in 2005 but declined to 599 in 2007 mainly due to continued acquisitions in the national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 the retail division’s total revenues in 2007 increased 444 million to 5624 million a 86 increase over 2006 of this increase approximately 341 million was the net growth in core commissions and fees however 444 million was from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2006 and therefore 103 million was lost on a “samestore sales” basis resulting in a negative internal growth rate of 21 the majority of the negative internal growth resulted from continued competitive insurance pricing in the western united states however the most competitive pricing in the second half of the 2007 year occurred in florida and this insurance pricing environment is likely to continue for at least the first half of 2008 

income before income taxes in 2007 increased 136 million from 2006 of which 137 million was from an historically high amount of gains from the sales of books of business customer accounts even though the sales of customer accounts were higher than normal during 2007 we do not believe that it is indicative of a future trend the remaining decrease was due the reduced earnings from the negative growth in core commissions and fees but offset by earnings from acquisitions 

the retail division’s total revenues in 2006 increased 268 million to 5180 million a 55 increase over 2005 of this increase approximately 167 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2005 the remaining increase was primarily due to net new business growth the retail division’s net internal growth rate in core commissions and fees revenue was 25 in 2006 excluding revenues recognized in 2006 from new acquisitions and the 2005 commissions and fees revenue from divested business the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue for the retail division in 2005 was 06 the increase in the net internal growth rate from core commission and fees from 2005 to 2006 primarily reflects increased premium rates for coastal property in the southeastern part of the united states but offset by lower insurance premium rates in most other parts of the country 

income before income taxes in 2006 increased 169 million to 1457 million a 131 increase over 2005 this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions a positive net internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate 

wholesale brokerage division 

the wholesale brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance and reinsurance primarily through independent agents and brokers like the retail and national programs divisions the wholesale brokerage division’s revenues are primarily commissionbased

 32 

total revenues in 2007 increased 156 million over 2006 of which 103 million was from increased profitsharing contingent commissions and 57 million from core commissions and fees profitsharing contingent commissions increased as a result of higher insurance company profitability resulting from the increased premium rates during 2006 as well as new profitsharing contingent commissions from operations acquired in 2006 of the net increase in core commissions and fees of 57 million approximately 152 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2006 the wholesale brokerage division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue in 2007 was 63 or 95 million less revenues than in 2006 excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in 2007 from new acquisitions the negative internal growth rate for the wholesale brokerage division was primarily the result of the continuation of lost revenues from the same wholesale operations that had the most significant loss of revenues in 2006 one of those operations which focuses on homebuilding construction accounts in the western region of the united states lost 62 million as a result of the continued slowdown in economic activity in that region during the year as well as lower insurance premium rates the other significantly affected operation was the floridabased wholesale brokerage operations of hull  company which lost 58 million of revenues in 2007 as a result of the competitive rate environment created by citizens offsetting some of the lost business in florida due to citizens we did have revenue growth in our binding authority operations and our reinsurance intermediary axiom re 

income before income taxes in 2007 increased 11 million to 280 million a 42 increase over 2006 this increase is attributable in part to the fact that the 2007 loss from our reinsurance intermediary was 21 million less than in 2006 and higher earnings from our binding authority operations mainly driven by higher profitsharing contingent commissions offsetting these increases our operation that focuses on home building construction accounts in the western region of the united states had 29 million less income before income taxes than it earned in 2006 due to the reduction of revenues mentioned above 

total revenues in 2006 increased 362 million to 1633 million a 285 increase over 2005 of this increase approximately 256 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2005 the wholesale brokerage division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue in 2006 was 39 excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in 2006 from new acquisitions the weaker internal growth rate than in recent years for the wholesale brokerage division was primarily the result of lower revenues from two of our operations one of those operations which focuses on homebuilding construction accounts in the western region of the united states experienced a slowdown in economic activity during the year as well as lower insurance premium rates the second operation was the personal lines wholesale brokerage arm of hull  company which had significant premium capacity restrictions on placing coastal property coverage with their insurance carriers which was not the case in 2005 

income before income taxes in 2006 decreased 14 million to 269 million a 51 decrease over 2005 this decrease is attributable in part to axiom re and delaware valley underwriting agency operations acquired in 2006 which had an aggregate loss before income taxes of 40 million as a result of initial transitional issues and net lost business additionally our operation that focuses on homebuilding construction accounts in the western region of the united states had income before income taxes of 30 million less than it earned in 2005 due to the reduction of revenues mentioned above offsetting these losses were net increases in income before income taxes from our other wholesale brokerage operations 

national programs division 

the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and special programs which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups public and quasipublic entities and market niches like the retail division the national programs division’s revenues are primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 total revenues in 2007 were essentially flat compared with 2006 due to the netting of different programs some of which had very good growth and another of which lost nearly half of its revenues in 2007 approximately 58 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2006 the national program division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 56 representing 87 million of lost revenues excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in 2007 from new acquisitions as previously discussed when citizens began to compete aggressively in florida on january 1 2007 it had the greatest impact on our condominium program at our florida intracoastal underwriters “fiu” profit center in 2007 fiu lost 134 million of core commissions and fees of the 272 million of total core commissions and fees that it had earned in 2006 most of our other programs including our lawyers and dentist professional liability programs our public entity business our sports and entertainment programs and our proctor financial operation all had positive internal growth since citizen’s impact on the insurance rates in florida and on fiu has completed a full twelvemonth period and that citizens’ 2007 insurance rates are guaranteed through january 1 2009 we do not believe that the citizens’ impact in 2008 will be as significant to fiu as it was in 2007 

income before income taxes in 2007 decreased only 14 million from 2006 however excluding the 30 million paid to the state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties in 2006 that was allocated to national programs the net decrease was 44 million of that decrease 107 million was attributable to fiu which was offset by increased earnings from the 2007 acquisitions and the programs that had positive internal growth 

total revenues in 2006 increased 235 million to 1575 million a 176 increase over 2005 of this increase approximately 93 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2005 the national program division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 89 excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in 2006 from new acquisitions the majority of the internally generated growth in the 2006 core commissions and fees revenue was primarily related to increasing insurance premium rates in our condominium program at fiu profit center that occurred as a result of the 2005 and 2004 hurricane seasons as well as strong growth in the public entity business and the proctor financial operation 

income before income taxes in 2006 increased 102 million to 486 million a 265 increase over 2005 of which the majority related to the revenues derived from acquisitions completed in 2006 and the increased earnings at fiu additionally in 2006 a total of 58 million was paid to state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties which concluded the state of florida’s investigation of compensation paid to us see note 13 of the 58 million 30 million was allocated to other operating expenses in national programs 

services division 

the services division provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration “tpa” and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services unlike our other segments approximately 986 of the services division’s 2007 commissions and fees revenue is generated from fees which are not significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums 

financial information relating to our services division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 total revenues in 2007 increased 28 million over 2006 of which approximately 23 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from an acquisition for which there was no comparable revenues in 2006 the services division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 19 in 2007 excluding the 2006 core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions and divested business the positive net internal growth rates from core commissions and fees revenue primarily reflect the net new business growth from our medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services the commissions and fees from our workers’ compensation and public and quasipublic entity tpa business was essentially flat in 2007 compared with 2006 however in september 2007 one of our largest clients took the majority of its claimspaying services inhouse which will result in approximately 400000 less revenues per month through august 2008 

income before income taxes in 2007 increased 07 million over 2006 primarily due to strong net new business growth in our medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services 

total revenues in 2006 increased 51 million to 326 million a 185 increase over 2005 of this increase approximately 45 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were 

no comparable revenues in 2005 in 2006 other income was 0 compared with the 2005 other income of 10 million which was due to the sale of a medical tpa operation in 2004 the services division’s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 56 in 2006 excluding the 2005 core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions and divested business the positive net internal growth rates from core commissions and fees revenue primarily reflect the strong net new business growth from our workers’ compensation claims and public and quasipublic entity tpa businesses 

income before income taxes in 2006 increased 10 million to 80 million a 139 increase over 2005 primarily due to strong net new business growth and the acquisitions of an operation in the medicare secondary payer statute compliancerelated services 

other 

as discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the “other” column in the segment information table includes any income and expenses not allocated to reportable segments and corporaterelated items including the intercompany interest expense charge to the reporting segment during 2007 we sold all of our shares of the rocktenn company and recorded a total gain of 187 million 

quarterly operating results 

the following table sets forth our quarterly results for 2007 and 2006 

 liquidity and capital resources 

our cash and cash equivalents of 382 million at december 31 2007 reflected a decrease of 502 million from the 885 million balance at december 31 2006 during 2007 2153 million of cash was provided from operating activities also during this period 2123 million of cash was used for acquisitions 306 million was used for additions to fixed assets 291 million was used for payments on longterm debt and 351 million was used for payment of dividends

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities the “current ratio” was 106 and 110 at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

as of december 31 2007 our contractual cash obligations were as follows 

contractual cash obligations 

 in july 2004 we completed a private placement of 2000 million of unsecured senior notes the “notes” the 2000 million is divided into two series series a for 1000 million due in 2011 and bearing interest at 557 per year and series b for 1000 million due in 2014 and bearing interest at 608 per year the closing on the series b notes occurred on july 15 2004 the closing on the series a notes occurred on september 15 2004 we have used the proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and repayment of existing debt as of december 31 2007 and 2006 there was an outstanding balance of 2000 million on the notes 

on december 22 2006 we entered into a master shelf and note purchase agreement the “master agreement” with a national insurance company the “purchaser” the purchaser purchased notes issued by the company in 2004 the master agreement provides for a 2000 million private uncommitted shelf facility for the issuance of senior unsecured notes over a threeyear period with interest rates that may be fixed or floating and with such maturity dates not to exceed ten 10 years as the parties may determine the master agreement includes various covenants limitations and events of default currently customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers the initial issuance of notes under the master facility occurred on december 22 2006 through the issuance of 250 million in series c senior notes due december 22 2016 with a fixed interest rate of 566 per annum on february 1 2008 we issued 25 million in series d senior notes due january 15 2015 with a fixed interest rate of 537 per annum 

also on december 22 2006 we entered into a second amendment to amended and restated revolving and term loan agreement the “second term amendment” and a third amendment to revolving loan agreement the “third revolving amendment” with a national banking institution amending the existing amended and restated revolving and term loan agreement dated january 3 2001 the “term agreement” and the existing revolving loan agreement dated september 29 2003 as amended the “revolving agreement” respectively the amendments provide covenant exceptions for the notes issued or to be issued under the master agreement and relaxed or deleted certain other covenants in the case of the third amendment to revolving loan agreement the lending commitment was reduced from 750 million to 200 million the maturity date was extended from september 30 2008 to december 20 2011 and the applicable margins for advances and the availability fee were reduced based on the company’s funded debt to ebitda ratio the applicable margin for eurodollar advances changed from a range of libor plus 0625 to 1625 to a range of libor plus 0450 to 0875 the applicable margin for base rate advances changed from a range of libor plus 000 to 0125 to the prime rate less 1000 the availability fee changed from a range of 0175 to 0250 to a range of 0100 to 0200 the 90day libor was 470 and 536 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the prime rate was 725 and 825 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively there were no borrowings against this facility at december 31 2007 or 2006 

in january 2001 we entered into a 900 million unsecured sevenyear term loan agreement with a national banking institution bearing an interest rate based upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus 050 to 100 depending upon brown  brown’s quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation 

amortization and noncash stock grant compensation the 90day libor was 470 and 536 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the loan was fully funded on january 3 2001 and was to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of 3200000 through december 2007 as of december 31 2007 the outstanding balance had been paid in full 

all four of these credit agreements require that we maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2007 and 2006 

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our master agreement and the revolving agreement described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2008 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototal capitalization ratio we would have the ability to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 

in december 2001 a universal “shelf” registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the public offering and sale from time to time of an aggregate of up to 250 million of debt andor equity securities was declared effective the net proceeds from the sale of such securities could be used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and to meet working capital needs a common stock followon offering of 5000000 shares in march 2002 was made pursuant to this “shelf” registration statement as of december 31 2007 approximately 900 million of the universal “shelf” registration remains available if we needed to publicly raise additional funds we may need to register additional securities with the sec 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line and term loan agreements 

our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments and certificates of deposit at december 31 2007 and 2006 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date as of december 31 2006 our largest security investment was 559970 common stock shares of rocktenn company a new york stock exchange listed company which we owned for more than 25 years our investment in rocktenn company accounted for 81 of the total value of availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit as of december 31 2006 in 2007 we sold our investment in rocktenn company for a net gain of 187 million as of december 31 2007 we have no remaining shares of rocktenn company and thus have no current exposure to equity price risk relating to the common stock of rocktenn company 

to hedge the risk of increasing interest rates from january 2 2002 through the remaining six years of our sevenyear 90 million term loan on december 5 2001 we entered into an interest rate exchange or “swap” agreement 

that effectively converted the floating rate interest payments based on libor to fixed interest rate payments at 453 this agreement did not impact or change the required 050 to 100 credit risk spread portion of the term loan we do not otherwise enter into derivatives swaps or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes as of december 31 2007 the interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with final principal payment on the term loan 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

there were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure in 2007 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation the “evaluation” required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” based on the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls as described in this item 9a are effective in alerting them timely to material information required to be included in our periodic sec reports 

in conducting brown  brown’s evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting brown  brown has excluded the following acquisitions completed by brown  brown during 2007 alcos inc grinspec inc sobel affiliates inc the combined group inc et al murfield insurance inc security insurance inc ii security risk managers inc professional risk managers inc jpmorgan insurance agency inc island risk management associates inc independent insurance associates inc mcfall general agency inc dalton insurance agency llc evergreen re incorporated and turner  associates insurance agency inc collectively these acquisitions represented 118 of total assets as of december 31 2007 42 of total revenue and 34 of net income for the year ended december 31 2007 refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on brown  brown’s consolidated financial statements 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2007 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

general 

 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage and service organization with origins dating from 1939 headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida we market and sell to our customers insurance products and services primarily in the property casualty and employee benefits areas as an agent and broker we do not assume underwriting risks instead we provide our customers with quality insurance contracts as well as other targeted customized risk management products and services 

 

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and by fees paid by customers for certain services the commission is usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases a commission is shared with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “contingent commission” which is a profitsharing commission based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention fees are principally generated by our services division which offers thirdparty claims administration consulting for the selffunded workers’ compensation insurance market and managed healthcare services the amount of our revenue from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units 

 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance the premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance carriers from these hurricanes the insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states the insurance premium rates in general declined during 2006

in 2004 we sold our louisianabased employee benefits tpa we currently have no operations in the employee benefits tpa business and have no current plans to reenter this area of the services business 

 

employees 

 

at december 31 2006 we had 4733 employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our insured customers and employees after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our insured customers and employees generally extend for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

 

competition 

 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price there are a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence that compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere this situation is particularly pronounced outside of florida 

 

a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct writing has had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially rather than individually oriented 

 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may experience further consolidation which in turn has resulted and could further result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents or brokers by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a  risk factors 

as referenced this annual report on form 10k includes certain forwardlooking statements regarding various matters the ultimate correctness of those forwardlooking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be different from those expressed or implied by those statements undue reliance should not be placed on those forwardlooking statements the following important factors among others as well as those factors set forth in our other sec filings from time to time could affect future results and events causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing brown  brown inc and its subsidiaries additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or otherwise may also impair our business operations 

we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

we are primarily engaged in insurance agency and wholesale brokerage activities and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products the amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 general premium levels were depressed as a result of the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance companies and increased competition in many cases insurance companies lowered commission rates and increased volume requirements significant reductions in premium rates occurred during the years 1986 through 1999 as a result of increasing loss ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus loss adjustment expenses against earned premiums experience by insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2004 there was a rapid transition as previously stable or increasing rates fell in most markets these rate declines were most pronounced in the property and casualty market with rates falling between 10 and 30 by yearend rate declines continued on a moderated basis through 2006 with the exception of premium rates on coastal property which increased 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including our practices and arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities and related private litigation the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any material decrease in our profitsharing contingent commissions is likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably for us may adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition to routine litigation and disclosed governmental investigations and requests for information we have been named as a defendant in two purported class actions brought against a number of insurance intermediaries and insurance companies and have received a derivative demand from counsel for a purported shareholder which could result in a purported securities class action based on claimed improprieties in the manner in which we are compensated by insurance companies the final outcome of these and similar matters and related costs cannot be determined an unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain factual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we may be subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these potential matters which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have subject to our selfinsured deductibles been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from two insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 53 and 49 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 80 and 54 respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies respectively should either of these insurance companies seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result no other insurance company accounts for 5 or more of our total revenues 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida georgia michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida georgia michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania and washington for the years ended december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 we derived 6175 million or 714 and 5703 million or 735 of our commissions and fees from our operations located in these states respectively we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to clients in these states we believe the regulatory environment for insurance agencies in these states currently is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in a few states we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance agencies whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of other insurance intermedaries which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of insurance agencies brokers and other intermediaries our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets will require us to continue to implement and improve our operations financial and management information systems integrated acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenue profitability or productivity comparable to our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities that have substantially greater resources acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of managements attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition 

our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance intermediaries business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for clients and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us because relationships between insurance intermediaries and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several states legislatures among the provisions considered for inclusion in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could result in a reduction in the demand for liability insurance policies or a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

we compete in a highly regulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our stockholders the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing of entities to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to 

time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds in california and certain other states these state funds could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such reductions in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida california or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

profit sharing contingent commissions and overrides paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profitsharing contingent commissions and overrides paid by insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the volume and the growth andor profitability of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year the aggregate of these commissions generally accounts for 52 to 56 of the previous year’s total annual revenues over the last three years override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year due to the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these profitsharing contingent commissions further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations because these commissions affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that will be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are all influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including profitsharing contingent commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production the factors that cause these variations are not within our control specifically consumer demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in one of our quarters or years until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals may have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts estimates of our future earnings and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stocks market price also may be affected by our ability to meet stock analysts earnings and other expectations and any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many listed companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stocks market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies securities if any such litigation is instigated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the loss of any member of our senior management team particularly our chairman and chief executive officer j hyatt brown could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results 

we believe that our future success partly depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including senior management brokers and other key personnel the loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of the services of j hyatt brown our chairman and chief executive officer who beneficially owned approximately 153 of our outstanding common stock as of february 23 2007 and is key to the development and implementation of our business strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results we maintain a 5 million key man life insurance policy with respect to mr brown we also maintain a 20 million insurance policy on the lives of mr brown and his wife under the terms of an agreement with mr and mrs brown at the option of the brown estate we will purchase upon the death of the later to die of mr brown or his wife shares of our common stock owned by mr and mrs brown up to the maximum number that would exhaust the proceeds of the policy 

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control of the company   

at february 23 2007 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 20 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 153 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 the affairs and policies of brown  brown 

recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations may to increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which became law in july 2002 has required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of that act the securities and exchange commission “sec” and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage likewise these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 and future yearends as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 

as directed by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in addition the public accounting firm auditing the our financial statements must attest to and report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting while we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently than we do or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may decline to attest to management’s assessment or to issue a report other than an unqualified opinion a report other than an unqualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap in the united states of america any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the securities and exchange commission are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   

 

general 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report all share and per share information has been restated to give effect to a twoforone common stock split that became effective november 28 2005 

 

we are a diversified insurance agency wholesale brokerage and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida since 1993 our stated corporate objective has been to increase our net income per share by at least 15 every year we have increased revenues from 956 million in 1993 as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 8780 million in 2006 a compound annual growth rate of 186 in the same period we increased net income from 80 million as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 1724 million in 2006 a compound annual growth rate of 266 since 1993 excluding the historical impact of poolings our pretax margins income before income taxes and minority interest divided by total revenues improved in all but one year and in that year the pretax margin was essentially flat these improvements have resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business revenues generated by acquisitions and continued operating efficiencies our revenue growth in 2006 was driven by i net new business growth and ii the acquisition of 32 agency entities and several books of business customer accounts generating total annualized revenues of approximately 564 million 

our commissions and fees revenue is comprised of commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels so as to determine what premium to charge the insured these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors including reinsurance rates paid by insurance carriers none of which we control beginning in 1986 and continuing through 1999 commission revenues were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting from intense competition among property and casualty insurance companies for market share this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” generally resulted in flat to reduced commissions on renewal business the effect of this softness in rates on our commission revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and net new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance carriers as the result of these hurricanes the insurance premium rates in 2006 increased on coastal property primarily in the southeastern region of the united states in the other regions of the united states the insurance premium rates in general declined during 2006 

 

the volume of business from new and existing insured customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions further impact our revenues for example the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage conversely level rates of inflation or general declines in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units our revenues have continued to grow as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we anticipate that results of operations will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions in 2007 

 

we also earn “profitsharing contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on underwriting results and other aforementioned considerations for the prior years over the last three years profitsharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 54 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue profitsharing contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes profitsharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered recently two national insurance carriers announced the replacement of the current lossratio based profitsharing contingent commission calculation with a more guaranteed fixedbased methodology the impact of such changes on our operations or financial position is not currently known 

 

fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers’ compensation and alllines liability arenas as well as medicare setaside services in each of the past three years fee revenues generated by the services division have declined as a percentage of our total commissions and fees from 40 in 2004 to 38 in 2006 this declining trend is anticipated to continue as the revenues from our other reportable segments grow at a faster pace 

 

investment income consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 

 

acquisitions 

  during 2006 we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 32 insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts the aggregate purchase price was 1559 million including 1387 million of net cash payments the issuance of 37 million in notes payable and the assumption of 135 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 564 million 

during 2005 we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 32 insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts the aggregate purchase price was 2886 million including 2440 million of net cash payments the issuance of 381 million in notes payable and the assumption of 65 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 1259 million 

 

during 2004 we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 29 insurance intermediary operations several books of business customer accounts and the outstanding stock of three general insurance agencies the aggregate purchase price was 1993 million including 1906 million of net cash payments the issuance of 14 million in notes payable and the assumption of 73 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 1041 million 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1  summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

 

revenue recognition 

 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later at that date the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted by known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies profitsharing contingent commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

 

business acquisitions and purchase price allocations 

 

we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts partially include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals however they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on the duration and any unique features of each specific agreement purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” 

 

intangible assets impairment 

 

effective january 1 2002 we adopted sfas no 142 which requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to lowerofcostormarket impairment testing sfas no 142 requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” 

 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2006 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards previously referred to as “restricted stock” to its employees officers and directors effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” for its stockbased compensation plans among other things sfas 123r requires that compensation expense for all sharebased awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

reserves for litigation 

 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of inside and outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and impact our net income 

derivative instruments 

 

in 2002 we entered into one derivative financial instrument  an interest rate exchange agreement or “swap”  to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our 90 million variable rate debt as of december 31 2006 we maintained this swap agreement whereby we pay a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pays us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base london interbank offering rate “libor” we have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in the fair market value of the swap are reflected in other comprehensive income the fair market value of this instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counterparties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows the valuation of this derivative instrument is a significant estimate that is largely affected by changes in interest rates if interest rates increase or decrease the value of this instrument will change accordingly 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 

 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 

 

 

 

commissions and fees 

 

commissions and fees revenue including profitsharing contingent commissions increased 115 in 2006 215 in 2005 and 171 in 2004 profitsharing contingent commissions increased 61 million to 410 million in 2006 primarily as a result of a better than average year for insurance companies’ loss ratios core commissions and fees revenue increased 40 in 2006 31 in 2005 and 43 in 2004 when excluding commissions and fees revenue generated from acquired operations and also from divested operations the 2006 results reflect the continued moderation of the insurance premium rate growth that began in 2004 in most regions of the united states but offset by increases in the insurance premium rates for coastal property in the southeastern united states 

 

investment income 

 

investment income increased to 115 million in 2006 compared with 66 million in 2005 and 27 million in 2004 the increases in 2006 over 2005 and 2005 over 2004 were primarily the result of higher investment yields earned each sequential year along with higher average available cash balances for each successive year 

other income net 

 

other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets in 2006 gains of 11 million were recognized from the sale of customer accounts as compared with 27 million and 48 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically will sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth for these reasons in 2004 we sold all four of our retail offices in north dakota and our sole remaining operation in the medical thirdparty administration services business 

 

employee compensation and benefits 

 

employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 80 in 2006 193 in 2005 and 171 in 2004 primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid on net new business employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues were 461 in 2006 477 in 2005 and 486 in 2004 reflecting a gradual improvement in personnel efficiencies as revenues grow we had 4733 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2006 compared with 4540 at december 31 2005 and 3960 at december 31 2004 

 

noncash stockbased compensation 

 

the company grants stock options and nonvested stock awards to its employees officers and directors effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” for its stockbased compensation plans among other things sfas 123r requires that compensation expense for all sharebased awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grantdate fair value of those awards 

 

 

prior to january 1 2006 the company accounted for stockbased compensation using the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees “apb no 25” and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas 123” as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensationtransitions and disclosures “sfas 148” 

 

under apb no 25 no compensation expense was recognized for either stock options issued under the company’s stock compensation plans or for stock purchased under the company’s 1990 employee stock purchase plan “espp” the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share for stock options and espp awards were instead disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements compensation expense was previously recognized for awards of nonvested stock based upon the market value of the common stock on the date of award on a straightline basis over the requisite service period with the effect of forfeitures recognized as they occurred as such the 2005 and 2004 noncash stockbased compensation expense of 33 million and 26 million respectively were solely related to the performance stock plan “psp” grants under apb 25 

for 2006 the noncash stockbased compensation under sfas 123r incorporates costs related to each of our three stockbased plans as explained in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the 54 million expense in 2006 consisted of 19 million related to the psp plan 05 million related to the limited amount of incentive stock options issued and the remaining 30 million relates to the espp 

 

other operating expenses 

 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses increased to 144 in 2006 from 134 in 2005 and 131 in 2004 legal and professional fee expenses increased 17 million in 2006 over the amount expended in 2005 which in turn was 44 million greater than what was expended in 2004 the increase in legal and professional fee expenses was primarily the result of the various ongoing investigations and litigation relating to agent and broker compensation including profitsharing contingent commissions by state regulators and to a lesser extent by the requirements of compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 additionally in 2006 a total of 58 million was paid to state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties which concluded the state of florida’s investigation of compensation paid to us see note 13 excluding the impact of these increased legal and professional fee expenses and settlement payments other operating expenses declined as a percentage of total revenues each year from 2004 to 2006 which is attributable to the effective cost containment measures brought about by our initiative designed to identify areas of excess expense this decrease is also due to the fact that in a net internal revenue growth environment certain significant other operating expenses such as office rent office supplies data processing and telephone costs increase at a slower rate than commissions and fees revenue during the same period 

 

amortization 

 

amortization expense increased 33 million or 98 in 2006 111 million or 501 in 2005 and 47 million or 268 in 2004 the increases in 2006 and 2005 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 

 

depreciation 

 

depreciation increased 124 in 2006 129 in 2005 and 86 in 2004 these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computers related equipment and software and the depreciation of fixed assets associated with acquisitions completed in those years  

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense decreased 11 million or 77 in 2006 over 2005 as a result of lower average debt balances due to the normal quarterly principal payments interest expense increased 73 million or 1022 in 2005 and 35 million or 975 in 2004 as a result of the funding of 200 million of unsecured senior notes in the third quarter of 2004 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 385 in 2006 383 in 2005 and 377 in 2004 the higher effective tax rate in 2006 and 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily the result of increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates 

 

results of operations  segment information 

 

as discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate in four reportable segments the retail national programs wholesale brokerage and services divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses are the result of acquisitions within a given division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management places emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues

retail division 

 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public and quasipublic entity professional and individual insured customers more than 96 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue are commissionbased since the majority of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions that we receive will be reflected in our pretax income the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue accounted for 718 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in 2004 but declined to 597 in 2006 mainly due to continued acquisitions in the national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions 

 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 

 

 

  the retail division’s total revenues in 2006 increased 268 million to 5180 million a 55 increase over 2005 of this increase approximately 167 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2005 the remaining increase was primarily due to net new business growth the retail division’s net internal growth rate in core commissions and fees revenue was 25 in 2006 excluding revenues recognized in 2006 from new acquisitions and the 2005 commissions and fees revenue from divested business the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue for the retail division in 2005 was 06 the increase in the net internal growth rate from core commission and fees from 2005 to 2006 primarily reflects increased premium rates for coastal property in the southeastern part of the united states but offset by lower insurance premium rates in most other parts of the country 

income before income taxes in 2006 increased 169 million to 1457 million a 131 increase over 2005 this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions a positive net internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate 

the retail division’s total revenues in 2005 increased 299 million to 4912 million a 65 increase over 2004 of this increase approximately 289 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2004 the remaining increase was primarily due to net new business growth the retail division’s net internal growth rate in core commissions and fees revenue was 06 in 2005 excluding revenues recognized in 2005 from new acquisitions and the 2004 commissions and fees revenue from divested business the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue for the retail division in 2004 was 28 the decline in the net internal growth rate from core commissions and fees revenue from 2004 to 2005 primarily reflects the softening of insurance premium rates during that period 

income before income taxes in 2005 increased 152 million to 1289 million a 134 increase over 2004 this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions a positive net internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate 

 

national programs division 

 

the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and special programs which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups public and quasipublic entities and market niches like the retail division the national programs division’s revenues are primarily commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands except percentages

income before income taxes in 2006 decreased 14 million to 269 million a 51 decrease over 2005 this decrease is attributable in part to axiom re and delaware valley underwriting agency operations acquired in 2006 which had an aggregate loss before income taxes of 40 million as a result of initial transitional issues and net lost business additionally our operation that focuses on home building construction accounts in the western region of the united states had income before income taxes of 30 million less than it earned in 2005 due to the reduction of revenues mentioned above offsetting these losses were net increases in income before income taxes from our other wholesale brokerage operations

as a result of the wholesale brokerage division’s significant acquisitions in 2005 and late 2004 as well as the net new business growth from existing operations income before income taxes in 2005 increased 170 million to 283 million a 1497 increase over 2004 the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue improved in 2005 over 2004 primarily due to two reasons 1 the majority of the operations acquired in 2005 and 2004 operated at higher operating profit margins than the wholesale brokerage divisions 2004 combined margins and 2 during 2005 one branch of our largest wholesale brokerage profit center improved its operating profit margin by over 9

as of december 31 2006 our contractual cash obligations were as follows 

 

contractual cash obligations 

 

 

 

  in july 2004 we completed a private placement of 2000 million of unsecured senior notes the “notes” the 2000 million is divided into two series series a for 1000 million due in 2011 and bearing interest at 557 per year and series b for 1000 million due in 2014 and bearing interest at 608 per year the closing on the series b notes occurred on july 15 2004 the closing on the series a notes occurred on september 15 2004 we have used the proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and repayment of existing debt as of december 31 2006 and 2005 there was an outstanding balance of 2000 million on the notes 

on december 22 2006 we entered into a master shelf and note purchase agreement the master agreement with a national insurance company the purchaser the purchaser purchased notes issued by the company in 2004 the master agreement provides for a 2000 million private uncommitted shelf facility for the issuance of senior unsecured notes over a threeyear period with interest rates that may be fixed or floating and with such maturity dates not to exceed ten 10 years as the parties may determine the master agreement includes various covenants limitations and events of default currently customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers the initial issuance of notes under the master facility occurred on december 22 2006 through the issuance of 250 million in series c senior notes due december 22 2016 with a fixed interest rate of 566 per annum 

also on december 22 2006 we entered into a second amendment to amended and restated revolving and term loan agreement the second term amendment and a third amendment to revolving loan agreement the third revolving amendment with a national banking institution amending the existing amended and restated revolving and term loan agreement dated january 3 2001 the term agreement and the existing revolving loan agreement dated september 29 2003 as amended the revolving agreement respectively the amendments provide covenant exceptions for the notes issued or to be issued under the master agreement and relaxed or deleted certain other covenants in the case of the third amendment to revolving loan agreement the lending commitment was reduced from 750 million to 200 million the maturity date was extended from september 30 2008 to december 20 2011 and the applicable margins for advances and the availability fee were reduced based on the companys funded debt to ebitda ratio the applicable margin for eurodollar advances changed from a range of 0625 to 1625 to a range of 0450 to 0875 the applicable margin for base rate advances changed from a range of 000 to 0125 to the prime rate less 1000 the availability fee changed from a range of 0175 to 0250 to a range of 0100 to 0200   the 90day libor was 536 and 453 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively there were no borrowings against this facility at december 31 2006 or 2005 

in january 2001 we entered into a 900 million unsecured sevenyear term loan agreement with a national banking institution bearing an interest rate based upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus 050 to 100 depending upon brown  brown’s quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stock grant compensation the 90day libor was 536 and 453 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the loan was fully funded on january 3 2001 and as of december 31 2006 had an outstanding balance of 12857000 this loan is to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of 3200000 through december 2007 

 

all four of these credit agreements require that we maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2006 and 2005 

 

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our master agreement and the revolving agreement described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2007 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototal capitalization ratio we would have the ability to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 

 

in december 2001 a universal “shelf” registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the public offering and sale from time to time of an aggregate of up to 250 million of debt andor equity securities was declared effective the net proceeds from the sale of such securities could be used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and to meet working capital needs a common stock followon offering of 5000000 shares in march 2002 was made pursuant to this “shelf” registration statement as of december 31 2006 approximately 900 million of the universal “shelf” registration remains available if we needed to publicly raise additional funds we may need to register additional securities with the sec 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line and term loan agreements 

our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and investments and certificates of deposit at december 31 2006 and 2005 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date our largest security investment is 559970 common stock shares of rocktenn company a new york stock exchange listed company which we have owned for more than 25 years our investment in rocktenn company accounted for 81 and 68 of the total value of availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively rocktenn companys closing stock price at december 31 2006 and 2005 was 2711 and 1365 respectively our exposure to equity price risk is primarily related to the rocktenn company investment as of december 31 2006 the value of the rocktenn company investment was 15181000 in late january 2007 the stock of rocktenn began trading in excess of 3200 per share and the board of directors authorized the sale of 275000 shares we realized a gain of 8840000 in excess of our original cost basis as of february 23 2007 we have remaining 284970 share of rocktenn at a value of 9891000 we may sell these remaining shares in 2007 

to hedge the risk of increasing interest rates from january 2 2002 through the remaining six years of our sevenyear 90 million term loan on december 5 2001 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted the floating rate interest payments based on libor to fixed interest rate payments at 453 this agreement did not impact or change the required 050 to 100 credit risk spread portion of the term loan we do not otherwise enter into derivatives swaps or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

at december 31 2006 the interest rate swap agreement was as follows

tableend 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation the “evaluation” required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” based on the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls as described in this item 9a are effective in alerting them timely to material information required to be included in our periodic sec reports 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2006 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

ceo and cfo certifications 

exhibits 311 and 312 are the certifications of the ceo and the cfo respectively the certifications are required in accordance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “section 302 certifications” this item of this report which you are currently reading is the information concerning the evaluation referred to in the section 302 certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented

brown  brown inc together with its subsidiaries collectively “we” “brown  brown” or the “company” make “forwardlooking statements” within the “safe harbor” provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 throughout this report and in the documents we incorporate by reference into this report you can identify these statements by forwardlooking words such as “may” “will” “expect” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “plan” and “continue” or similar words we have based these statements on our current expectations about future events although we believe the expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements included in this form 10k and those reports statements information and announcements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements whether oral or written made by us or on our behalf many of these factors have previously been identified in filings or statements made by us or on our behalf important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements in this report include

general 

 

we are a diversified insurance agency brokerage and service organization with origins dating from 1939 headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida we market and sell to our customers insurance products and services primarily in the property casualty and employee benefits areas as an agent and broker we do not assume underwriting risks instead we provide our customers with quality insurance contracts as well as other targeted customized risk management products and services 

 

 

 

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid by customers for certain services the commission is usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases a commission is shared with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “contingent commission” which is a profitsharing commission based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention fees are principally generated by our services division which offers thirdparty claims administration consulting for the selffunded workers’ compensation insurance market and managed healthcare services the amount of our revenue from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units 

 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance the premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded primarily as a result of these hurricanes including hurricanes katrina rita and wilma the total insured losses are estimated to be in excess of 50 billion the full impact that the 2005 insured losses will have on the insurance premium rates charged by insurance companies for 2006 is unknown however there appears to be a general consensus that there will be upward pressure on at least the insurance premium rates on coastal property primarily in the southeastern part of the united states 

 

as of december 31 2005 our activities were conducted in 170 locations in 34 states as follows 

 

 

 

business combinations

in september 2001 we established brown  brown re inc a subsidiary headquartered in new york new york that specializes in treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage services brown  brown re had approximately 20 million in commission revenues in 2005 

 

on january 1 2006 we acquired the assets of axiom intermediaries llc axiom with estimated annualized revenues of 140 million brown  brown re will be merged into axiom the axiom acquisition will substantially increase our treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage services 

 

in march 2005 we acquired the assets of hull  company inc hull with estimated annualized revenues of 630 million which along with acquisitions of several other larger brokerage operations essentially tripled the 2005 revenues of this division over 2004 revenues 

 

services division 

 

at december 31 2005 our services division employed 285 persons and provided the following services 1 insurancerelated services including comprehensive risk management and thirdparty administration tpa services for insurance entities and selffunded or fullyinsured workers’ compensation and liability plans and 2 comprehensive medical utilization management services for both workers’ compensation and alllines liability insurance plans 

 

the services division’s workers’ compensation and liability plan tpa services include claims administration access to major reinsurance markets cost containment consulting services for secondary disability and subrogation recoveries and risk management services such as loss control in 2005 our three largest workers’ compensation contracts represented approximately 616 of our services divisions commissions and fees revenue or approximately 21 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in addition the services division provides managed care services including medical networks case management and utilization review services certified by the american accreditation health care commission 

 

in 2004 we sold our louisianabased employee benefits tpa in 2003 we sold a similar operation based in florida we currently have no operations in the employee benefits tpa business and have no current plans to reenter this area of the services business 

 

employees 

 

at december 31 2005 we had 4540 employees we have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our insured customers and employees after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these agreements are atwill and terminable by either party however the covenants not to solicit our insured customers and employees generally continue for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

 

 

 

competition 

 

the insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price there are a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence that compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere this situation is particularly pronounced outside of florida 

 

a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct writing has had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially oriented 

 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may experience further consolidation which in turn has resulted and could further result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents or brokers by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to penalties by a particular state

 item 1a risk factors 

as referenced this annual report on form 10k includes certain forwardlooking statements regarding various matters the ultimate correctness of those forwardlooking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be different from those expressed or implied by those statements undue reliance should not be placed on those forwardlooking statements the following important factors among others as well as those factors set forth in our other sec filings from time to time could affect future results and events causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing brown  brown inc and its subsidiaries additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or otherwise may also impair our business operations 

we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues because our commissions depend on premium rates charged by insurance companies which historically have varied and as a result have been difficult to predict 

 

 

 

we are primarily engaged in insurance agency and brokerage activities and derive revenues principally from commissions paid by insurance companies the amount of such commissions is highly dependent on premium rates charged by insurance companies we do not determine insurance premiums premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market historically property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 general premium levels were depressed as a result of the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance companies and increased competition in many cases insurance companies lowered commission rates and increased volume requirements significant reductions in premium rates occurred during the years 1986 through 1999 as a result of increasing loss ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus loss adjustment expenses against earned premiums experience by insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2004 there was a rapid transition as previously stable or increasing rates fell in most markets these rate declines were most pronounced in the property and casualty market with rates falling between 10 and 30 by yearend rate declines continued through 2005 although the pace of decline moderated in the latter part of the year 

as traditional riskbearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to nonaffiliated brokers or agents such as us those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers the reduction of these commission rates along with general volatility andor declines in premiums may significantly affect our profitability because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues including whether they will significantly decline as a result our budgets for future acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect our operations 

our business practices and compensation arrangements are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and related private litigation 

the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry including us are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities and related private litigation the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements including laws prohibiting such arrangements and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds and various state departments of insurance may adopt new regulations addressing these matters while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry’s commission payment practices or the responses by the market and government regulators any material decrease in our contingent commissions is likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably for us may adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition to routine litigation and disclosed governmental investigations and requests for information we have been named as a defendant in two purported class actions brought against a number of insurance intermediaries and insurance companies and have received a derivative demand from counsel for a purported shareholder which could result in a purported securities class action based on claimed improprieties in the manner in which we are compensated by insurance companies the final outcome of these and similar matters and related costs cannot be determined an unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain factual and potential claims lawsuits and proceedings 

we may be subject to various actual and potential claims lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance in the ordinary course of business because we often assist clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs such claims lawsuits and other proceedings could for example include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or subagents improperly failed to procure coverage report claims on behalf of clients provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 

while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have subject to our selfinsured deductibles been covered by our professional indemnity insurance our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience in addition claims lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

 

 

 

we derive a significant portion of our commission revenues from two insurance companies the loss of which could result in additional expense and loss of market share 

for the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 80 and 54  respectively of our total revenues were derived from insurance policies underwritten by two separate insurance companies respectively should either of these insurance companies seek to terminate their arrangements with us we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business although some additional expense and loss of market share could possibly result no other insurance company accounts for 5 or more of our total revenues 

because our business is highly concentrated in california florida georgia new jersey new york pennsylvania and washington adverse economic conditions or regulatory changes in these states could adversely affect our financial condition 

a significant portion of our business is concentrated in california florida georgia new jersey new york pennsylvania and washington for the years ended december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 we derived 5548 million or 706 and 4687 million or 725 of our commissions and fees from our operations located in these states respectively we believe that these revenues are attributable predominately to clients in these states we believe the regulatory environment for insurance agencies in these states currently is no more restrictive than in other states the insurance business is a stateregulated industry and therefore state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry because our business is concentrated in a few states we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those states than insurance agencies whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states in addition the occurrence of adverse economic conditions natural or other disasters or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our growth strategy depends in part on the acquisition of insurance agencies which may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which if consummated may not be advantageous to us 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of insurance agencies our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions integrate acquired businesses into our operations and expand into new markets will require us to continue to implement and improve our operations financial and management information systems integrated acquired entities may not achieve levels of revenue profitability or productivity comparable to our existing locations or otherwise perform as expected in addition we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities that have substantially greater resources acquisitions also involve a number of special risks such as diversion of managements attention difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of personnel entry into unfamiliar markets unanticipated problems or legal liabilities and tax and accounting issues some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition 

our current market share may decrease as a result of increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry 

the insurance agency business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for clients and insurance companies many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us because relationships between insurance agencies and insurance companies or clients are often local or regional in nature this potential competitive disadvantage is particularly pronounced outside of florida a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers in addition as and to the extent that banks securities firms and insurance companies affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly and aggressively offer a wider variety of financial services including insurance than we currently offer 

proposed tort reform legislation if enacted could decrease demand for liability insurance thereby reducing our commission revenues 

legislation concerning tort reform has been considered from time to time in the united states congress and in several states among the provisions considered for inclusion in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards including punitive damages and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by states in which we sell insurance could result in a reduction in the demand for liability insurance policies or a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold thereby reducing our commission revenues 

 

 

 

we compete in a highly regulated industry which may result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

we conduct business in most states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of stockholders the laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to among other things licensing to transact business licensing of agents admittance of assets regulating premium rates approving policy forms regulating unfair trade and claims practices establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms and restricting payment of dividends also in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools which compete directly on a subsidized basis with private insurance providers we act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds in california and certain other states these state funds could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive any such event in a state in which we have substantial operations such as florida arizona or new york could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurancerelated laws and regulations or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable local state and federal laws rules and regulations there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive specifically recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 

profit sharing contingent commissions and overrides paid by insurance companies are less predictable than usual which impairs our ability to predict the amount of such commissions that we will receive 

we derive a portion of our revenues from profit sharing contingent commissions and overrides paid by insurance companies the aggregate of these commissions generally accounts for 54 to 71 of the previous years total annual revenues over the last three years profit sharing contingent commissions are special revenuesharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the volume and the growth andor profitability of the business placed with such companies during the prior year we primarily receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year override commissions are paid by insurance companies based on the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year due to recent changes in our industry including the agreement of at least one carrier with government regulators to cease payment of certain of such commissions and including changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies we cannot predict the payment of these commissions as well as we have been able to in the past further we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves which affects our ability to make profitsharing calculations because these commissions affect our revenues any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition 

our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions 

we have extensive operations and are subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business resulting from alleged errors and omissions because we often assist our clients with matters including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims that involve substantial amounts of money errors and omissions claims against us may in turn allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs errors and omissions could include for example our employees or subagents failing whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage or to notify insurance companies of claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases while most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have subject to our selfinsured deductibles been covered by our professional liability insurance our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure in addition errors and omissions claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

 

 

we have not determined the amount of resources and the time that will be necessary to adequately respond to rapid technological change in our industry which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

frequent technological changes new products and services and evolving industry standards are all influencing the insurance business the internet for example is increasingly used to transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate businesstobusiness information exchange and transactions we believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future we have not determined however the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require which may result in shortterm unexpected interruptions to our business or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price andor efficiency as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies 

quarterly and annual variations in our commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operations 

our commission income including contingent commissions but excluding fees can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production the factors that cause these variations are not within our control specifically consumer demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals new business and lost business which includes generally policies that are not renewed and cancellations in addition as discussed we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in one of our quarters or years until after the end of that period which can adversely affect our ability to budget for significant future expenditures quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based on increases and decreases associated with the timing of policy renewals have had an adverse effect on our financial condition in the past and we may experience such effects in the future 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect your investment 

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results changes in securities analysts estimates of our future earnings and our loss of significant customers or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors our common stocks market price also may be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations and any failure to meet such expectations even if minor could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of equity securities of many companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our common stocks market price in the past securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies securities if any such litigation is instigated against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the loss of any member of our senior management team particularly our chairman and chief executive officer j hyatt brown could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including its senior management brokers and other key personnel the loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel or our inability to identify recruit and retain such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition although we operate with a decentralized management system the loss of the services of j hyatt brown our chairman and chief executive officer who beneficially owned approximately 16 of our outstanding common stock as of february 2 2006 and is key to the development and implementation of our business strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results we maintain a 5 million key man life insurance policy with respect to mr brown we also maintain a 20 million insurance policy on the lives of mr brown and his wife under the terms of an agreement with mr and mrs brown at the option of the brown estate we will purchase upon the death of the later to die of mr brown or his wife shares of our common stock owned by mr and mrs brown up to the maximum number that would exhaust the proceeds of the policy 

certain of our existing stockholders have significant control   

at february 2 2006 our executive officers directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 20 of our outstanding common stock of which j hyatt brown our chairman and chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately 16 as a result our executive officers directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over 1 the election of our board of directors 2 the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval and 3 the affairs and policies of brown and brown   

 

 

recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations may to increase our costs 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 that became law in july 2002 has required changes in some of our corporate governance securities disclosure and compliance practices in response to the requirements of that act the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage likewise these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 

due to inherent limitations there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in informing management of all material information in timely manner 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 and future yearends as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 

as directed by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting on form 10k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in addition the public accounting firm auditing the company’s financial statements must attest to and report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting while we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section 404 requirements if our independent auditors interpret the section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented operated or reviewed they may decline to attest to management’s assessment or issue a qualified report a qualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap in the united states of america any changes in estimates judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

the consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the securities and exchange commission are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap in the united states of america involves making estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets including intangible assets liabilities and related reserves revenues expenses and income estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and income any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   

 

general 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report all share and per share information has been restated to give effect to a twoforone common stock split that become effective november 28 2005 

 

  we are a diversified insurance agency brokerage and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida since 1993 our stated corporate objective has been to increase our net income per share by at least 15 every year we have increased revenues from 956 million in 1993 as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 7858 million in 2005 a compound annual growth rate of 192 in the same period we increased net income from 80 million as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 1506 million in 2005 a compound annual growth rate of 277 we have also increased net income per share 150 or more for 13 consecutive years excluding the effect of a onetime investment gain of 13 million in 1994 and favorable adjustments to our income tax reserves of 07 million in 1994 and 05 million in 1995 respec tively since 1993 excluding the historical impact of poolings   our pretax margins income before income taxes and minority interest divided by total revenues improved in all but one year and in that year the pretax margin was essentially flat these improvements have resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business revenues generated by acquisitions and continued operating efficiencies our revenue growth in 2005 was driven by i net new business growth and ii the acquisition of 32 agency entities and several books of business customer accounts generating total annualized revenues of approximately 1259 million 

our commissions and fees revenue are comprised of commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels so as to determine what premium to charge the insured these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors including reinsurance rates none of which we control beginning in 1986 and continuing through 1999 commission revenues were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting from intense competition among property and casualty insurance companies for market share among other factors this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” generally resulted in flat to reduced commissions on renewal business the effect of this softness in rates on our commission revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and net new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance premium rates decreased in 2004 as general premium rates continued to moderate the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since 1992 when hurricane andrew hit south florida the insured losses from the 2004 hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during 2005 during the third quarter of 2005 the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded primarily as a result of these hurricanes including hurricanes katrina rita and wilma the total insured losses are estimated to be in excess of 50 billion the full impact that the 2005 insured losses will have on the insurance premium rates charged by insurance companies for 2006 is unknown however there appears to be a general consensus that there will be upward pressure on at least the insurance premium rates on coastal property primarily in the southeastern part of the united states 

 

the volume of business from new and existing insured customers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions further impact our revenues for example the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage conversely level rates of inflation and the general decline of economic activity in recent years have limited the increases in the values of insurable exposure units still our revenues continue to grow as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we anticipate that results of operations will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions in 2006 

 

we also earn “contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but may also reflect considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year based on underwriting results and other aforementioned considerations for the prior years and over the last three years have averaged approximately 60 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees” excludes contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered 

 

fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty administration and consulting for the selffunded workers’ compensation markets in each of the past three years fee revenues generated by the services division have declined as a percentage of our total commissions and fees from 51 in 2003 to 34 in 2005 this declining trend is anticipated to continue as the revenues from our other reportable segments grow at a faster pace   

 

investment income consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 

 

 

 

 

acquisitions 

 

during 2005 we acquired the assets of 32 insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts the aggregate purchase price was 2886 million including 2440 million of net cash payments the issuance of 381 million in notes payable and the assumption of 65 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 1259 million 

 

during 2004 we acquired the assets of 29 insurance intermediary operations several books of business customer accounts and the outstanding stock of three general insurance agencies the aggregate purchase price was 1993 million including 1906 million of net cash payments the issuance of 14 million in notes payable and the assumption of 73 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 1041 million 

 

during 2003 we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of 23 insurance intermediary operations as well as the remaining 25 minority interest in florida intracoastal underwriters and several books of business customer accounts the aggregate purchase price was 862 million including 845 million of net cash payments the issuance of 15 million in notes payable and the assumption of 02 million of liabilities these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 458 million 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reason able under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1  summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

 

revenue recognition 

 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective   date of the insurance policy or the date the policy premium is billed to the customer whichever is later at that date the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted by known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies contingent commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

 

business acquisitions and purchase price allocations 

 

we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 

 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 141 “business combinations” all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals but it primarily represents the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on the duration and any unique features of each specific agreement purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 142 

 

intangible assets impairment 

 

effective january 1 2002 we adopted sfas no 142 which requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to lowerofcostormarket impairment testing sfas no 142 requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of revenues earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and pretax income 

 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and of our amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circum stances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2005 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 

 

 

 

 

reserves for litigation 

 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and impact our net income 

derivative instruments 

 

in 2002 we entered into one derivative financial instrument  an interest rate exchange agreement or “swap”  to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our 90 million variable rate debt as of december 31 2005 we maintained this swap agreement whereby we pay a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pays us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base london interbank offering rate libor we have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in the fair market value of the swap are reflected in other comprehensive income the fair market value of this instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counterparties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows the valuation of this derivative instrument is a significant estimate that is largely affected by changes in interest rates if interest rates increase or decrease the value of this instrument will change accordingly 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 

 

results of operations for the years ended de cember 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 

 

 

 

commissions and fees 

 

commissions and fees revenue including contingent commissions increased 215 in 2005 171 in 2004 and 206 in 2003 core commissions and fees revenue increased 31 in 2005 43 in 2004 and 59 in 2003 when excluding commissions and fees revenue generated from acquired operations and also from divested operations the 2005 results reflect the continued moderation of the premium rate growth that began in 2004 compared with the slightly higher premium growth rates that occurred in 2003 

 

investment income 

 

investment income i ncreased to 66 million in 2005 compared with 27 million in 2004 and 14 million in 2003 the increases in 2005 over 2004 and 2004 over 2003 were primarily the result of higher investment yields earned each sequential year along with higher average available cash balances for each successive year 

 

other income net 

 

other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale an d disposition of assets in 2005 gains of 27 million were recognized from the sale of customer accounts as compared with 48 million and 40 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically will sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth for these reasons in 2004 we sold all four of our retail offices in north dakota and our sole remaining operation in the medical thirdparty administration services business 

 

employee compensation and benefits 

 

employee compensation and benefits incre ased approximately 193 in 2005 171 in 2004 and 194 in 2003 primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid on net new business employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues were 477 in 2005 486 in 2004 and 487 in 2003 reflecting a gradual improvement in personnel efficiencies as revenues grow we had 4540 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2005 compared with 3960 at december 31 2004 and 3517 at december 31 2003 

 

noncash stock grant compensation 

 

noncash stock grant compensation expense represents the expense required to be recorded under accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” relating to our stock performance plan which is more fully described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

the annual cost of this stock performance plan increases only when our average stock price over a 20tradingday period increases by increments of 20 or more from the price at the time of the original grant or when additional shares are granted and the average stock price increases 

 

since the first vesting condition for performance stock grants issued in 2001 was satisfied in 2002 when a 20tradingday average stock price of 1750 was reached we issued another significant set of performance stock grants in january 2003 at a grant price per share of 1750 there will be no expense relating to this set of performance stock grants until the 20tradingday average stock price exceeds the 1750 performance stock grant price by an increment of 20 additionally other grants are periodically issued to new and existing employees 

 

during 2004 the average stock price exceeded the 2100 average price for a 20tradingday period required for the first 20 of the shares granted in january 2003 to be awarded and therefore we began the annual expensing of such shares as a result the 2004 expense increased to 26 million from 23 million in 2003 during 2005 the average stock price exceeded the 2800 average price for a 20tradingday period required for the second and third 20 increments of the shares granted in january 2003 to be awarded and as a result the 2005 expense increased to 33 million from 26 million in 2004 

 

during 2003 since the average price of our stock never exceeded any of the 20 thresholds of the grants priced at 1750 per share the only expense related to our stock performance plan was the annual expense of grants issued prior to 2003 which was then partially offset by expense credits from forfeitures as a result the 2003 expense decreased to 23 million from 38 million in 2002 

 

other operating expenses 

 

as a percentage of total revenues other operating expenses increased to 134 in 2005 from 131 in 2004 which in turn was a decrease from 135 in 2003 legal and professional fee expenses increased 44 million in 2005 over the amount expended in 2004 which in turn was 12 million greater than what was expended in 2003 the increase in legal and professional fee expenses was primarily the result of the various ongoing investigations and litigation relating to agent and broker compensation including contingent commissions by state regulators and to a lesser extent by the requirements of compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 offsetting these expenses in 2004 was approximately 10 million in reductions to our litigation and claims reserve excluding the impact of these increased legal and professional fee expenses other operating expenses declined as a percentage of total revenues each year from 2003 to 2005 which is attributable to the effective cost containment measures brought about by our initiative designed to identify areas of excess expense this decrease is also due to the fact that in a net internal revenue growth environment certain significant other operating expenses such as office rent office supplies data processing and telephone costs increase at a slower rate than commissions and fees revenue increase during the same period   

 

 

 

 

amortization 

 

amortization expense increased 111 million or 501 in 2005 increased 47 million or 268 in 2004 and increased 34 million or 244 in 2003 as part of our annual impairment assessment as of november 30 2004 management determined that the maximum amortization period for the intangible asset pur chased customer accounts should be reduced from 20 years to 15 years a change in accounting estimate was recognized to reflect this decision resulting in an increase in the 2005 and 2004 amortization expense of 64 million and 05 million a decrease in net income of 39 million and 03 million and a decrease of 003 and nil 0 earnings per share respectively the remaining increases in 2005 and 2004 were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of new acquisitions 

 

depreciation 

 

dep reciation increased 129 in 2005 86 in 2004 and 132 in 2003 these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computers related equipment and software and the depreciation associated with new acquisitions 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense increased 73 million or 1022 in 2005 and 35 million or 975 in 2004 as a result of the funding of 200 million of unsecured senior notes in the third quarter of 2004 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate on income f rom operations was 383 in 2005 377 in 2004 and 375 in 2003 the higher effective tax rate in 2005 compared with 2004 and 2003 was primarily the result of increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates 

 

results of operations  segment information 

 

as discussed in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate in four reportable segments the retail national programs brokerage and service divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses are the result of new acquisitions within that division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets additionally increases in noncash stock grant compensation is more dependent on increases in the company’s 20 tradingday average stock price than on the divisional results as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management places greater emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue the gradual improve ment of the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

 

 

 

 

retail division 

 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public entity professional and individual insured customers more than 96 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue are commis sionbased since the majority of our operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions that we receive will be reflected in our pretax income the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue accounted for 725 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in 2003 but declined to 631 in 2005 mainly due to continued acquisitions in the national programs and brokerage divisions 

 

financial information relating to brown  brown’s retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 

 

the retail division’s total revenues in 2005 increased 299 million to 4912 million a 65 increase over 2004 of this increase approximately 289 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2004 the remaining increase was primarily due to net new business growth the retail division’s net internal growth rate in core commissions and fees revenue was 06 in 2005 excluding revenues recognized in 2005 from new acquisitions and the 2004 commissions and fees revenue from divested business the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue for the retail division in 2004 and 2003 was 27 and 40 respectively the decline in the net internal growth rate from core commissions and fees revenue from 2003 to 2005 primarily reflects the softening of insurance premium rates during that period 

income before income taxes in 2005 increased 152 million to 1289 million a 134 increase over 2004 this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions a positive net internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate 

 

the retail division’s total revenues in 2004 increased 623 million to 4613 million a 156 increase over 2003 of this increase approximately 599 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2003 the remaining increase was primarily due to net new business growth during 2004 we sold our four retail offices in north dakota and other books of businesses in various offices with respect to these assets sold during 2004 67 million of core commissions and fees revenue were earned in 2003 for which there were no revenues recognized in the comparable 2004 period therefore the retail division’s net internal growth rate in core commissions and fees revenue was 27 in 2004 excluding revenues recognized in 2004 from new acquisitions and the 2003 core commissions and fees revenue from divested business 

 

income before income taxes in 2004 increased 153 million to 1136 million a 155 increase over 2003 this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions a positive net internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate

income before income taxes and minority interest in 2004 increased 22 million to 339 million a 70 increase over 2003 of which the majority related to the revenues derived from acquisitions completed in 2004 but offset primarily by lower earnings at fiu the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue were higher in 2004 than 2003 primarily due to two reasons 1 2004 total revenues reflected 28 million less profitsharing contingency commissions income than in 2003 due primarily to the impact of the 2004 hurricanes in florida and 2 the 2003 and 2004 acquisitions reporting in this division accounted for 27 of the division’s total revenues but operated at a lower aggregate operating profit margin of approximately 380 thereby diluting the historical aggregate operating profit margin of this division

as a result of the brokerage division’s significant acquisitions in 2005 and late 2004 as well as the net new business growth from existing operations income before income taxes in 2005 increased 170 million to 283 million a 1497 increase over 2004 the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue improved in 2005 over 2004 primarily due to two reasons 1 the majority of the operations acquired in 2005 and 2004 operated at higher operating profit margins than the brokerage divisions 2004 combined margins and 2 during 2005 one of our largest brokerage profit centers branch improved their operating profit margins by over 9

contractual cash obligations 

 

 

 

 

in july 2004 we completed a private placement of 2000 million of unsecured senior notes the “notes” the 2000 million is divided into two series series a for 1000 million due in 2011 and bearing interest at 557 per year and series b for 1000 million due in 2014 and bearing interest at 608 per year the closing on the series b notes occurred on july 15 2004 the closing on the series a notes occurred on september 15 2004 we have used the proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and repayment of existing debt as of december 31 2005 there was an outstanding balance of 2000 million on the notes 

 

in september 2003 we established an unsecured revolving credit facility with a national banking institution that provided for available borrowings of up to 750 million with a maturity date of october 2008 bearing an interest rate based upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus 0625 to 1625 depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stock grant compensation a commitment fee of 0175 to 0375 per annum was assessed on the unused balance the 90day libor was 453 as of december 31 2005 there were no borrowings against this facility at december 31 2005 

 

in january 2001 we entered into a 900 million unsecured sevenyear term loan agreement with a national banking institution borrowings under this facility bear interest based upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus a credit risk spread ranging from 050 to 100 depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stock grant compensation the 90day libor was 453 as of december 31 2005 the loan was fully funded on january 3 2001 and a balance of 257 million remained outstanding as of december 31 2005 this loan is to be repaid in equal quarterly principal installments of 32 million through december 2007 effective january 2 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a national banking institution to lock in an effective fixed interest rate of 453 for the remaining six years of the term loan excluding our credit risk spread of between 050 and 100 

 

in 1991 we entered into a longterm unsecured credit agreement with a major insurance company that provided for borrowings at an interest rate equal to the prime rate 925 at december 31 2002 plus 100 in accordance with an august 1 1998 amendment to this credit agreement the outstanding balance was repaid in august 2003 thus ending the credit agreement 

 

all of our credit agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2005 and 2004 

 

neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our unsecured revolving credit facility described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2006 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debttototal capitalization ratio we would have the ability to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 

 

in december 2001 a universal “shelf” registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the public offering and sale from time to time of an aggregate of up to 250 million of debt andor equity securities was declared effective the net proceeds from the sale of such securities could be used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and to meet working capital needs a common stock followon offering of 5000000 shares in march 2002 was made pursuant to this “shelf” registration statement as of december 31 2005 approximately 900 million of the universal “shelf” registration remains available if we needed to publicly raise additional funds we may need to register additional securities with the sec 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line and term loan agreements 

our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and certificates of deposit   at december 31 2005 and 2004 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date however we have no current intentions to add to or dispose of any of the 559970 common stock shares of rocktenn company a publiclyheld new york stock exchange listed company which we have owned for more than 10 years the investment in rocktenn company accounted for   68 of the total value of availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively rocktenn companys closing stock price at december 31 2005 and 2004 was 1365 and 1516 respectively our exposure to equity price risk is primarily related to the rocktenn company investment as of december 31 2005 the value of the rocktenn company investment was 7644000 

to hedge the risk of increasing interest rates from january 2 2002 through the remaining six years of our sevenyear 90 million term loan on december 5 2001 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted the floating rate interest payments based on a london interbank offering rate libor to fixed interest rate payments at 453 this agreement did not impact or change the required 050 to 100 credit risk spread portion of the term loan we do not otherwise enter into derivatives swaps or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

at december 31 2005 the interest rate swap agreement was as follows

there were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure in 2005 

 




 item 9a   controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act the “evaluation” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act “disclosure controls” based on the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls as described in this item 9a are effective in alerting them timely to material information required to be included in our periodic sec reports 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2005 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

 

  the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

ceo and cfo certifications 

exhibits 311 and 312 are the certifications of the ceo and the cfo respectively the certifications are required in accordance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “section 302 certifications” this item of this report which you are currently reading is the information concerning the evaluation referred to in the section 302 certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented

general 

we are a general insurance agency with origins dating from 1939 headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida we market and sell to our customers insurance products and services primarily in the property casualty and employee benefits areas as an agent and broker we do not assume underwriting risks instead we provide our customers with quality insurance contracts as well as other targeted customized risk management products and services 

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid by customers for certain services the commission is usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases a commission is shared with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “contingent commission” which is a profitsharing commission based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention fees are principally generated by our services division which offers thirdparty administration benefit consulting and managed healthcare services primarily in the area of workers’ compensation the amount of our income from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expense against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance the rates decreased we expect the softening of insurance premium rates to continue through 2005 

as of december 31 2004 our activities were conducted in 154 locations in 30 states as follows 

 business combinations 

beginning in 1993 through 2004 we acquired 173 insurance agency operations excluding acquired books of business customer accounts that had aggregate estimated annual revenues of 4477 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition of these 32 operations were acquired during 2004 with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 1033 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition during 2003 23 operations were acquired with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 426 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition additionally in 2003 we acquired the remaining 25 ownership of florida intracoastal underwriters limited company during 2002 32 operations were acquired with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 620 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the dates of acquisition 

during 2004 brown  brown acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 29 insurance agencies acquired the outstanding stock of three general insurance agencies and purchased several books of business customer accounts see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our 2004 acquisitions 

from january 1 2005 through march 3 2005 brown  brown acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 21 general insurance agencies and purchased several books of business customer accounts see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our 2005 acquisitions

in september 2001 we established brown  brown re inc a subsidiary headquartered in new york new york that specializes in treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage services brown  brown re had less than 2 million in commission revenues in 2004 

services division 

at december 31 2004 our services division employed 267 persons and provided the following services 1 insurancerelated services including comprehensive risk management and thirdparty administration tpa services for insurance entities and selffunded or fullyinsured workers’ compensation and liability plans and 2 certified managed care and utilization management services for both insurance programs and selffunded plans 

the services division’s workers’ compensation and liability plan tpa services include claims administration access to major reinsurance markets cost containment consulting services for secondary disability and subrogation recoveries and risk management services such as loss control in 2004 our two largest workers’ compensation contracts represented approximately 607 of our workers’ compensation tpa revenues or approximately 19 of our total commissions and fees revenue in addition the services division provides managed care services including medical networks case management and utilization review services certified by the american accreditation health care commission 

in 2004 we sold our louisianabased employee benefits tpa in 2003 we sold a similar operation based in florida we currently have no operations in the employee benefits tpa business and have no current plans to reenter this area of the services business 

employees 

at december 31 2004 we had 3960 employees we have contracts with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our insured customers and employees after separation from employment with us the enforceability of such contracts varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these contracts are terminable by either party however the agreements not to solicit our insured customers and employees generally continue for a period of two years after cessation of employment 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance agency and brokerage business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price there are a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence that compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere this situation is particularly pronounced outside of florida 

a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct writing has had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially oriented 

in addition the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate as a result the financial services industry has experienced and may experience further consolidation which in turn has resulted and could further result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition prospects 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we andor our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents or brokers by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we andor our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to penalties by a particular state

  m anagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

tableend general 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

we are a general insurance agency and brokerage head­quartered in daytona beach and tampa florida since 1993 our stated corporate objective has been to increase our net income per share by at least 15 every year we have increased revenues from 956 million in 1993 as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 6469 million in 2004 a compound annual growth rate of 190 in the same period we increased net income from 80 million as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting to 1288 million in 2004 a compound annual growth rate of 287 we have also increased net income per share 150 or more for 12 consecutive years excluding the effect of a onetime investment gain of 13 million in 1994 and favorable adjustments to our income tax reserves of 07 million in 1994 and 05 million in 1995 respectively since 1993 excluding the historical impact of poolings our pretax margins income before income taxes and minority interest improved in all but one year and in that year the pretax margin was essentially flat these improve­ments have resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business acquisitions and continued operating efficiencies our revenue growth in 2004 was driven by i net new business growth ii the acquisition of 32 agency entities and several books of business customer accounts with total annualized revenues of approximately 1041 million and iii flat to a slight decrease in premium rates in certain lines of business 

our commissions and fees revenue are comprised of commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid directly by customers commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds’ underlying “insurable exposure units” which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values sales and payroll levels so as to determine what premium to charge the insured these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors including reinsurance rates none of which we control beginning in 1986 and continuing through 1999 commission revenues were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting from intense competition among property and casualty insurance companies for market share among other factors this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates commonly referred to as a “soft market” generally resulted in flat to reduced commissions on renewal business the effect of this softness in rates on our commission revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisi­tions and net new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expense against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate and in certain lines of insurance the premium rates decreased we expect the softening of insurance premium rates to continue through 2005 

the volume of business from new and existing custom­ers fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions further impact our revenues for example the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some custom­ers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage conversely level rates of inflation and the general decline of economic activity in recent years have limited the increases in the values of insurable exposure units still our revenues continue to grow as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions we anticipate that results of operations will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions in 2005 

we also earn “contingent commissions” which are profitsharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results but may also contain considerations for volume growth andor retention these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year and over the last three years have averaged approximately 64 of the previous year’s total commissions and fees revenue contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received the term “core commissions and fees “ excludes contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insur­ance policies sold and specific feebased services rendered 

fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division which provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty administration consulting for the workers’ compensation and employee benefit selfinsurance markets and managed healthcare services in each of the past three years fee revenues generated by the services division have declined as a percentage of our total commis­sions and fees from 61 in 2002 to 40 in 2004 this declining trend is anticipated to continue as the revenues from our other reportable segments grow at a faster pace 

investment income consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 

acquisitions 

during 2004 brown  brown acquired the assets of 29 general insurance agencies several books of business customer accounts and the outstanding stock of three general insurance agencies the aggregate purchase price was 1993 million including 1905 million of net cash payments the issuance of 14 million in notes payable and the assumption of 73 million of liabilities these acquisi­tions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 1041 million 

during 2003 we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of 23 general insurance agencies as well as the remaining 25 minority interest in florida intracoastal underwriters and several books of business customer accounts these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 458 million 

during 2002 we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of 26 general insurance agencies several books of business customer accounts and the outstanding stock of six general insurance agencies these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of 620 million 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reason­able under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which values are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies see “note 1  summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

revenue recognition 

commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date the customer is billed whichever is later at that date the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted by known circumstances subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies contingent commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable which is when such commissions are received fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 

business acquisitions and purchase price allocations 

we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions these assets consist of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements and the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impair­ment charges 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 141 “business combinations” all of our business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 have been accounted for using the purchase method in connection with these acquisitions we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired busi­nesses that contain information about insurance policies customers and other matters essential to policy renewals but it primarily represents the present value of the under­lying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of those purchased customer accounts the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency expenses and discount rates any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts noncompete agreements are valued based on the duration and any unique features of each specific agreement purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straightline basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods which range from five to 15 years the excess of the purchase price of an acquisi­tion over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 142 

intangible assets impairment 

effective january 1 2002 we adopted sfas no 142 which requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to lowerofcostormarket impairment testing sfas no 142 requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value fair value is estimated based on multiples of revenues earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and pretax income 

management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis and amortizable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circum­stances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the following factors if present may trigger an impair­ment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii signifi­cant negative industry or economic trends iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and iv significant decline in our market capitalization if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the abovereferenced factors an impairment analysis is performed management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we maybe required to revise the assessment and if appropriate record an impairment charge we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30 2004 and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 

reserves for litigation 

we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income management with the assistance of outside counsel determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and impact our net income 

derivative instruments 

in 2002 we entered into one derivative financial instrument — an interest rate exchange agreement or “swap” — to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our 90 million variable rate debt as of dec­ember 31 2004 we maintained this swap agreement whereby we pay a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pays us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base london interbank offering rate libor we have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge and accordingly changes in the fair market value of the swap are reflected in other comprehensive income the fair market value of this instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counter parties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows the valuation of this derivative instrument is a significant estimate that is largely affected by changes in interest rates if interest rates increase or decrease the value of this instrument will change accordingly 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 

commissions and fees 

commissions and fees increased 171 in 2004 206 in 2003 and 257 in 2002 core commissions and fees increased 43 in 2004 59 in 2003 and 121 in 2002 when excluding commissions and fees generated from acquired operations and also divested operations the 2004 results reflect the moderation of the premium rate growth during the year as compared with the slightly higher premium growth rates in 2003 and the high premium growth rate of the 2002 “hard market” the 2002 results reflect the strong premium rate increases that began in the first quarter of 2000 and continued through 2002 

investment income 

investment income increased to 27 million in 2004 compared with 14 million in 2003 and 29 million in 2002 the increase in 2004 was primarily a result of slightly higher investment yields earned during the year along with much higher available cash balances principally due to the funding of the 200 million of unsecured senior notes in july and september of 2004 the decrease in 2003 was primarily a result of lower investment yields earned during the year along with lower available cash balances 

other income net 

other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets in 2004 gains of 48 million were recognized from the sale of customer accounts although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts we periodically will sell an office or a book of business that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth for these reasons in 2004 we sold all four of our retail offices in north dakota and our sole remaining operation in the medical thirdparty administration services business gains from the sale of customer accounts were 40 million in 2003 and 07 million in 2002 

employee compensation and benefits 

employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 171 in 2004 194 in 2003 and 198 in 2002 primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid on net new business employee compen­sation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues was 486 in 2004 487 in 2003 and 493 in 2002 reflecting a gradual improvement in personnel efficiencies as revenues grow we had 3960 fulltime equivalent employees at december 31 2004 compared with 3517 at december 31 2003 and 3384 at december 31 2002 

noncash stock grant compensation 

noncash stock grant compensation expense repre­sents the expense required to be recorded under accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” relating to our stock perfor­mance plan which is more fully described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the annual cost of this stock performance plan increases only when our average stock price over a 20tradingday period increases by increments of 20 or more from the price at the time of the original grant or when additional shares are granted and the stock price increases 

since the first vesting condition for performance stock grants issued in 2001 was satisfied in 2002 when a 20tradingday average stock price of 3500 was reached we issued another significant set of performance stock grants in january 2003 at a grant price per share of 3500 there will be no expense relating to this set of performance stock grants until the 20tradingday average stock price exceeds the 3500 performance stock grant price by an increment of 20 additionally other grants are periodi­cally issued to new and existing employees 

during 2004 the average stock price exceeded the 4200 average price for a 20tradingday period required for the first 20 of the shares granted in january 2003 to be awarded and therefore we began the annual expensing of such shares as a result the 2004 expense increased to 26 million from 23 million in 2003 

during 2003 since the average price of our stock never exceeded any of the 20 thresholds of the grants priced at 3500 per share the only expense related to our stock performance plan was the annual expense of grants issued prior to 2003 which was then partially offset by expense credits resulting from forfeitures as a result the 2003 expense decreased to 23 million from 38 million in 2002 

as a result of the stock price increase in 2002 the 2001 stock grants began to be expensed in 2002 and the 2002 expense increased to 38 million from 20 million in 2001 in 2002 07 million of the 38 million was expensed due to the accelerated vesting of some performance stock grants as a result of the deaths of two employees 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased 138 in 2004 121 in 2003 and 171 in 2002 however other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 131 in 2004 from 135 in 2003 and 146 in 2002 the continuing decline in other operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenues is attributable to the effective cost containment measures brought about by an initiative designed to identify areas of excess expense and to the fact that in a net internal revenue growth environment certain significant other operating expenses such as office rent office supplies data processing and telephone costs increase at a slower rate than commissions and fees revenue increase during the same period somewhat offsetting these cost efficiencies our incurred accounting legal and professional fees have increased approximately 1 million in 2004 over the 2003 levels due to the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and various ongoing investiga­tions of agent and broker compensation including contingent commissions by state regulators also during 2004 we expensed an additional 12 million for various state and local use taxes offsetting these additional expenses was approximately 09 million in reductions to our litigation and claims reserve 

amortization 

amortization expense increased 47 million or 268 in 2004 increased 34 million or 244 in 2003 and decreased 18 million or 115 in 2002 the increases in 2004 and 2003 were due to the amortization of addi­tional intangible assets as a result of new acquisitions as part of our annual impairment assessment as of november 30 2004 management determined that the maximum amortization period for the intangible asset purchased customer accounts should be reduced from 20 years to 15 years a change in accounting estimate was recognized to reflect this decision resulting in an increase in the 2004 amortization expense of 529000 a decrease in net income of 330000 and no impact on earnings per share future annual amortization expenses will increase by approxi­mately 64 million as a result of this change in accounting estimate the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 142 but was offset by the increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets from new acquisitions consummated in 2002 

depreciation 

depreciation increased 86 in 2004 132 in 2003 and 108 in 2002 these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computer and related equipment and the depreciation associated with new agency acquisitions 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 35 million or 975 in 2004 as a result of the funding of 200 million of unse­cured senior notes in the third quarter of 2004 interest expense decreased in 2003 by 10 million or 222 and 10 million or 183 in 2002 as a result of reductions in our outstanding debt 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 377 in 2004 375 in 2003 and 366 in 2002 the higher effective tax rate in 2004 compared with 2003 and 2002 was primarily the result of increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates 

results of operations  segment information 

as discussed in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we operate in four reportable seg­ments the retail national programs brokerage and service divisions on a divisional basis increases in amortization depreciation and interest expenses are the result of new acquisitions in that division in a particular year likewise other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets additionally increases in noncash stock grant compensation is more dependent on increases in the company’s average stock price than on the divisional results as such in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division management places greater emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue and the gradual improve­ment of the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 

retail division 

the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial public entity professional and individual customers more than 97 of the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue are commis­sionbased since the majority of our operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions that we receive will be reflected in our pretax income the retail division’s commissions and fees revenue accounted for 754 of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in 2002 but declined to 717 in 2004 mainly due to continued acquisi­tions in the national programs and brokerage divisions 

financial information relating to our retail division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 the retail division’s total revenues in 2004 increased 623 million to 4613 million a 156 increase over 2003 of this increase approximately 599 million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2003 the remain­ing increase was primarily due to net new business growth during 2004 we sold our four retail offices in north dakota and other books of businesses in various offices with respect to these assets sold during 2004 67 million of commissions and fees revenue were earned in 2003 for which there were no revenues recognized in the comparable 2004 period therefore the retail division’s net internal growth rate in core commissions and fees revenue was 27 in 2004 excluding therevenues recognized in 2004 from new acquisitions and the 2003 commissions and fees from divested business the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue for the retail division in 2003 and 2002 was 40 and 88 respectively the decline in the net internal growth rate from commissions and fees revenue from 2002 to 2004 primarily reflects the softening of insurance premium rates during that period 

income before income taxes in 2004 increased 153 million to 1136 million a 155 increase over 2003 this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions a positive internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate 

total revenues in 2003 increased 521 million to 3990 million a 150 increase over 2002 of this increase approximately 422 million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2002 the remaining increase was due to net new business growth and rising premium rates during the first half of 2003 during 2003 we sold certain offices and books of businesses which earned approximately 70 million in commissions and fees in 2002 for which there were no revenues recognized in the comparable 2003 period 

income before income taxes in 2003 increased 202 million to 984 million a 258 increase over 2002 this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions increases in premium rates and improved cost structure related to those entities acquired during 2002 

national programs division 

the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain profes­sionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and special programs which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups public entities and market niches like the retail division the national programs division’s revenues are essentially all commissionbased 

financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 total revenues in 2004 increased 216 million to 1121 million a 239 increase over 2003 of this increase approximately 216 million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2003 during 2004 we discontinued several programs including our professional medical program which generated approximately 12 million in revenues in 2003 but for which there were no comparable revenues in 2004 therefore the national program division’s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees was 45 exclud­ing commissions and fees recognized in 2004 from new acquisitions and the 2003 commissions and fees from divested business the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees for the national programs division in 2003 and 2002 was 112 and 197 respectively the decline in the internal growth rates from core commissions and fees from 2002 through 2004 was primarily related to declining insurance premium rates in our condominium program at our florida intracoastal underwriters fiu profit center the insurance rates in this program are expected to be up slightly in 2005 due to the impact of the hurricanes in 2004 

income before income taxes and minority interest in 2004 increased 22 million to 339 million a 70 increase over 2003 of which the majority related to the revenues derived from acquisitions completed in 2004 but offset primarily by lower earnings at fiu the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue were higher in 2004 than 2003 primarily due to two reasons 1 2004 total revenues reflected 28 million less profit sharing contingency income than in 2003 due primarily to the impact of the 2004 hurricanes in florida and 2 the 2003 and 2004 acquisitions reporting in this division accounted for 30 of the division’s total revenues but operated only in the 30 to 40 operating profit margin range thereby diluting the historical aggregate operating profit margin of this division 

total revenues in 2003 increased 293 million to 904 million a 480 increase over 2002 of this increase approximately 260 million was from calsurance associates which was acquired in november 2002 and several other agencies that were acquired that offer unique property and casualty insurance products designed for governmental agencies the remaining increase was primarily related to net new business growth in 2002 the underwriting insurance company on our professional medical program opted not to renew this contract effective march 2003 and without a replacement company the 2003 revenues of this program dropped to 08 million compared to 23 million in 2002 in 2004 this program ceased operations 

income before income taxes and minority interest in 2003 increased 50 million to 317 million a 185 increase over 2003 of which the majority related to the revenues derived from the calsurance associates acquisi­tion completed in 2002 

brokerage division 

the brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance and reinsurance primarily through independent agents and brokers like the retail and national programs divisions essentially all of the brokerage division’s revenues are commissionbased 

financial information relating to our brokerage division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 19 

total revenues in 2004 increased 99 million to 416 million a 311 increase over 2003 of this increase approximately 70 million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in 2003 the brokerage division’s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees in 2004 was 141 excluding commissions and fees recognized in 2004 from new acquisitions the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees for the brokerage division in 2003 and 2002 was 197 and 650 respectively the decline in the internal growth rates from core commissions and fees in 2004 from 2003 was primarily related to the decline in the net new business generated by our reinsur­ance brokerage unit and the gradual softening of insurance premium rates the significantly higher internal growth rates in 2002 reflect the significant new business growth of our startup wholesale brokerage operations over the division’s much smaller core revenue base in 2001 

as a result of the brokerage division’s net new business growth income before income taxes in 2004 increased 02 million to 113 million a 19 increase over 2003 the ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenues and the ratio of other operat­ing expenses to total revenue were higher in 2004 than 2003 primarily due to two reasons 1 2004 total revenues reflected 09 million less profit sharing contingency income than in 2003 and 2 during 2004 we started several new branches of our peachtree special risk brokers unit and the startup salaries and operational costs diluted the division’s normal operating profit margins 

total brokerage division revenues in 2003 increased 78 million to 317 million a 324 increase over 2002 of this increase 24 million related to commissions and fees from acquisitions for which there was no comparable revenue in 2003 the remaining increase is primarily due to net new business growth 

primarily as a result of the brokerage division’s strong net new business growth income before income taxes in 2003 increased 41 million to 111 million a 580 increase over 2002 

services division 

the services division provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty administration consulting for the workers’ compensation and employee benefit selfinsurance markets and managed healthcare services unlike our other segments approximately 94 of the services division’s 2004 commissions and fees revenue are generated from fees which are not significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums 

financial information relating to our service division is as follows in thousands except percentages 

 20 

total revenues in 2004 decreased 18 million to 268 million a 62 decrease from 2003 of this decrease approximately 66 million related to commissions and fees from medical thirdparty administration tpa business units sold in 2004 and 2003 these operations were sold because their respective operating profit margins were not expected to exceed the 1012 range and as such were not acceptable returns in our culture services division’s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees was 166 in 2004 excluding the 2003 commissions and fees from divested business the net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees for the services division in 2003 and 2002 was 79 and 114 respectively the positive internal growth rates from commissions and fees from 2002 through 2004 primarily reflect the strong net new business growth from our workers’ compensation and public risk tpa businesses 

income before income taxes in 2004 increased 09 million to 64 million a 154 increase over 2003 primarily due to strong net new business growth and the elimination of the lower margin medical tpa businesses sold in 2003 and 2004 

the services division’s total revenues in 2003 increased 07 million to 286 million a 25 increase over 2002 the majority of the increase was the result of net new business growth 

income before income taxes in 2003 increased 12 million to 55 million a 271 increase over 2002 primarily due to strong net new business growth and the elimination of the lower margin medical tpa business sold in 2003

contractual cash obligations 

 in july 2004 we completed a private placement of 200 million of unsecured senior notes the “notes” the 200 million is divided into two series series a for 100 million due in 2011 and bearing interest at 557 per year and series b for 100 million due in 2014 and bearing interest at 608 per year the closing on the series b notes occurred on july 15 2004 the closing on the series a notes occurred on september 15 2004 we have used and anticipate continuing to use the proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes including acquisi­tions and repayment of existing debt as of december 31 2004 there was an outstanding balance of 200 million on the notes 

in september 2003 we established an unsecured revolving credit facility with a national banking institution that provided for available borrowings of up to 75 million with a maturity date of october 2008 bearing an interest rate based upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus 0625 to 1625 depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stock grant compensation a commitment fee of 0175 to 0375 per annum was assessed on the unused balance the 90day libor was 256 as of december 31 2004 there were no borrowings against this facility at december 31 2004 

in january 2001 we entered into a 90 million unsecured sevenyear term loan agreement with a national banking institution borrowings under this facility bear interest based upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus a credit risk spread ranging from 050 to 100 depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash stock grant compensation the 90day libor was 256 as of december 31 2004 the loan was fully funded on january 3 2001 and a balance of 386 million remained outstanding as of december 31 2004 this loan is to be repaid in equal quarterly principal installments of 32 mil­lion through december 2007 effective january 2 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a national banking institution to lock in an effective fixed interest rate of 453 for the remaining six years of the term loan excluding our credit risk spread of between 050 and 100 

in 1991 we entered into a longterm unsecured credit agreement with a major insurance company that provided for borrowings at an interest rate equal to the prime rate 925 at december 31 2002 plus 100 in accordance with an august 1 1998 amendment to this credit agree­ment the outstanding balance was repaid in august 2003 thus ending the credit agreement 

all of our credit agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2004 and 2003 

neither we nor our subsidiaries have ever incurred offbalance sheet obligations through the use of or investment in offbalance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment portfolio and funds generated from operations together with our unsecured revolving credit facility described above will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at least the end of 2005 additionally we believe that funds generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt 

historically much of our cash has been used for acquisitions if additional acquisition opportunities should become available that exceed our current cash flow we believe that given our relatively low debt to total capitaliza­tion ratio we would have the ability to raise additional capital through either the private or public debt markets 

in december 2001 a universal “shelf” registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the public offering and sale from time to time of an aggregate of up to 250 million of debt andor equity securities was declared effective the net proceeds from the sale of such securities could be used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and to meet working capital needs the common stock followon offering of 5000000 shares in march 2002 was made pursuant to this “shelf” registration statement as of december 31 2004 approxi­mately 900 million of the universal “shelf” registration remains available if we needed to publicly raise additional funds we may need to register additional securities with the sec

tableend market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and equity prices we are exposed to market risk through our investments revolving credit line and term loan agreements 

our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents restricted cash availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and certificates of deposit at december 31 2004 and 2003 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 

we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities in addition we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date however we have no current intentions to add or dispose of any of the 559970 common stock shares of rocktenn company a publiclyheld nyse company which we have owned for more than ten years the investment in rocktenn company accounted for 68 and 86 of the total value of availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit as of december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the value of our holdings of rocktenn company’s common stock at december 31 2004 and 2003 was approximately 85 million and 97 million respectively each 10 decrease in market value of these securities would result in a decrease in value of approximately 850000 and 970000 from the fair value of those investments at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

to hedge the risk of increasing interest rates from january 2 2002 through the remaining six years of our sevenyear 90 million term loan on december 5 2001 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 38571000 that effectively converted the floating rate interest payments based on a london interbank offering rate “libor” to fixed interest rate payments at 453 this agreement did not impact or change the required 050 to 100 credit risk spread portion of the term loan the fair value of this interest rate swap agreement at december 31 2004 was a liability of 722000 a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company’s exposure to marked risk related to its interest rate position market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates relating to the interest rate swap agreement a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a change of 512362 in the interest rate swap agreement we do not otherwise enter into derivatives swaps or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

to the board of directors and stockholders of brown  brown inc daytona beach florida 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on financial statements and internal controls that brown  brown inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in management’s report on financial statements and internal controls management excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial reporting at eugene w pashley agency inc j gregory brown  company inc insurance  financial services doyle consulting group inc et al statfeld vantage insurance group llc et al waldor agency inc title pac inc et al proctor financial inc balconessouthwest inc insurance marketing group llc the mcduffee insurance agency inc wiita insurance agency inc et al international es insurance brokers inc et al and cf lake limited collec­tively the “2004 excluded acquisitions” which were acquired during 2004 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 189 and 95 respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at the 2004 excluded acquisitions the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and proce­dures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in condi­tions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 of the company and our report dated march 14 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements 

we make “forwardlooking statements” within the “safe harbor” provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 throughout this report and in the documents we incorporate by reference into this report you can identify these statements by forwardlooking words such as “may” “will” “expect” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “plan” and “continue” or similar words we have based these statements on our current expectations about future events although we believe that our expectations reflected in or suggested by our forwardlooking statements are reasonable our actual results may differ materially from what we currently expect important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements in this report include 

 you should carefully read this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect all forwardlooking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 

we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements 

general 

we are a general insurance agency that commenced business in 1939 and are headquartered in daytona beach and tampa florida we market and sell to our customers insurance products and services primarily in the property casualty and the employee benefits area as an agent and broker we do not assume underwriting risks instead we provide our customers with quality insurance contracts as well as other targeted customized risk management products 

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid by customers for certain services the commission is usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases a commission is shared with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a “contingent commission” which is a revenuesharing commission based upon the volume and the growth andor profitability of the business placed with such company during the prior year fees are principally generated by our services division which offers thirdparty administration benefit consulting and managed healthcare services primarily in the workers’ compensation and employee benefit markets the amount of our income from commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new business production retention of existing customers acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units 

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting industry has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999 the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a “soft market” during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing “loss ratios” the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expense against earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003 during 2003 the increases in premium rates began to moderate we expect this moderation of rates to continue through 2004 

beginning in 1993 through 2003 we acquired 141 insurance agency operations excluding acquired books of business that had aggregate estimated annual revenues of 3444 million for the 12 calendar months immediately following the date of acquisition of these 23 operations were acquired during 2003 with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 426 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the date of acquisition additionally we acquired the remaining 25 ownership of florida intracoastal underwriters during 2002 32 operations were acquired with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 620 million for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the date of acquisition additionally 26 operations were acquired during 2001 with aggregate estimated annual revenues of 1480 million for the 12 calendar months immediately following the date of acquisition including our asset acquisition of the insurance agency businessrelated assets of riedman corporation effective january 1 2001 with estimated annual revenues of 540 million for the 12 calendar months immediately following the date of acquisition the large number of acquisitions in 2001 in terms of aggregate estimated revenues was largely due to the thenanticipated elimination of poolingofinterests accounting for stock acquisitions which encouraged the shareholders of certain agencies especially “c” corporations to accelerate the sale of their stock to us as of december 31 2003 our activities were conducted in 136 locations in 29 states as follows 

 our business is divided into four reportable segments 1 the retail division 2 the national programs division 3 the services division and 4 the brokerage division the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial governmental professional and individual customers the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals and special programs which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups governmental entities and market niches 

the services division provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty administration consulting for the workers’ compensation and employee benefit selfinsurance markets and managed healthcare services the brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance and reinsurance primarily through independent agents and brokers in 2003 we generated commission and fee revenues of 5453 million 

the following table sets forth a summary of 1 the commission and fee revenues generated by each of our reportable segments for 2003 2002 and 2001 and 2 the percentage of our total commission and fee revenues represented by each segment for each such period 

 1 numbers and percentages have been restated to give effect to acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting in addition we made acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting during those periods which affect the comparability of results see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general” and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our acquisitions 

divisions 

retail division 

as of december 31 2003 our retail division operated in 26 states and employed 2555 persons our retail insurance agency business provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial governmental professional and individual customers the categories of insurance principally sold by us are property insurance against physical damage to property and resultant interruption of business or extra expense caused by fire windstorm or other perils and casualty insurance relating to legal liabilities workers’ compensation commercial and private passenger automobile coverages and fidelity and surety insurance we also sell and service group and individual life accident disability health hospitalization medical and dental insurance 

no material part of our retail business is attributable to a single client or a few customers during 2003 commissions and fees from our largest single retail division customer represented less than one percent of the retail division’s total commission and fee revenues 

in connection with the selling and marketing of insurance coverages we provide a broad range of related services to our customers such as risk management surveys and analysis consultation in connection with placing insurance coverages and claims processing we believe these services are important factors in securing and retaining customers 

national programs division 

as of december 31 2003 our national programs division employed 389 persons our national programs division consists of two units professional programs and special programs 

professional programs  professional programs provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents professional programs tailors insurance products to the needs of a particular professional group negotiates policy forms coverages and commission rates with an insurance company and in certain cases secures the formal or informal endorsement of the product by a professional association the professional groups serviced by the national programs division include dentists lawyers physicians optometrists opticians insurance agents and real estate agents the professional dental legal and medicalrelated programs are marketed and sold primarily through a national network of independent agencies while the professional liability programs of our calsurance operations in orange california are marketed and sold directly to our insured customers we also market a variety of these products through certain of our retail offices under agency agreements with the insurance companies that underwrite these programs we often have authority to bind coverages subject to established guidelines to bill and collect premiums and in some cases to process claims for the programs that we market through independent agencies we receive an “override commission” which is a commission based upon the commissions generated by these independent agencies 

below are brief descriptions of the programs offered to these major professional groups 

 special programs  special programs markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries trade groups governmental entities and market niches all of the special programs except for the parcel insurance plan® are marketed and sold primarily through independent agents parcel insurance plan® markets and sells its insurance product directly to the insured customers under agency agreements with the insurance 

companies that underwrite these programs we often have authority to bind coverages subject to established guidelines to bill and collect premiums and in some cases to process claims 

below are brief descriptions of the special programs 

 since 2001 we no longer offer the following commercial programs due to loss of underwriting insurance companies towing operators protector plan® automobile dealers protector plan® automobile transporters protector plan® automotive aftermarket protector plan® hightech target program sm  assisted living facilities protector plan® and manufacturers protector plan® 

services division 

at december 31 2003 our services division employed 260 persons and consisted of subsidiaries that provide the following services 1 insurancerelated services as a thirdparty administrator and consultant for employee health and welfare benefit plans 2 insurancerelated services including comprehensive risk management and thirdparty administration for insurance entities and selffunded or fullyinsured workers’ compensation and liability plans and 3 certified managed care and utilization management services for both insurance programs and selffunded plans 

in connection with its employee benefit plan administrative services the services division provides thirdparty administration and consulting related to benefit plan design and costing arrangement for the placement of stoploss insurance and other employee benefit coverages and settlement of claims services division units also provide utilization management services such as preadmission review concurrentretrospective review pretreatment review of certain nonhospital treatment plans and medical and psychiatric case management in addition to the administration of selffunded health care plans this unit offers administration of flexible benefit plans including plan design employee communication enrollment and reporting 

the services division’s workers’ compensation and liability thirdparty administration includes claim administration access to major reinsurance markets cost containment consulting services for secondary disability and subrogation recoveries and risk management services such as loss control in 2003 our two largest workers’ compensation contracts represented approximately 657 of our workers’ compensation thirdparty administration revenues or approximately 22 of our total commission and fee revenues in addition the services division provides managed care services certified by the american accreditation health care commission which include medical networks case management and utilization review services 

brokerage division 

the brokerage division markets excess and surplus commercial insurance and reinsurance to retail agencies primarily in the southeastern united states as well as throughout the united states including through our retail division the brokerage division represents various us and uk surplus lines companies and is also a lloyd’s of london correspondent in addition to surplus lines insurance companies the brokerage division represents admitted insurance companies for smaller agencies that do not have access to large insurance company representation excess and surplus products include commercial automobile garage restaurant builder’s risk and inland marine lines difficulttoinsure general liability and products liability coverages are a specialty as is excess workers’ compensation coverage retail agency business is solicited through mailings and direct contact with retail agency representatives at december 31 2003 the brokerage division employed 236 persons 

in march 2003 we acquired acumen re management corporation a subsidiary based in mount laurel new jersey that is a reinsurance underwriting management organization primarily acting as an outsourced specific excess workers’ compensation facultative reinsurance underwriting facility for the year 2003 acumen re had less than 1 million in commission revenues 

in september 2001 we established brown  brown re inc a subsidiary based in stamford connecticut that specializes in treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage services for the year 2003 brown  brown re had less than 2 million in commission revenues 

employees 

at december 31 2003 we had 3517 employees we have contracts with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our customers and employees after termination of employment with us the enforceability of such contracts varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these contracts are terminable by either party however the agreements not to solicit our customers and employees generally continue for a period of two or three years after employment termination 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

competition 

the insurance agency and brokerage business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets there are a number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence that compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere this situation is particularly pronounced outside of florida competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price 

a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct writing has had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially oriented 

in addition to the extent that the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation which in turn could result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition candidates 

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

we or our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary in individual states and are often complex 

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to penalties by a particular state 










 i tem 2 properties 

we lease our executive offices which are located at 220 south ridgewood avenue daytona beach florida 32114 and 401 east jackson street suite 1700 tampa florida 33602 we lease offices at every location with the exception of the following where we own the buildings in which our offices are located washington new jersey dansville hornell and jamestown new york and grand forks north dakota in addition we own a building in loreauville louisiana where we no longer have an office as well as a parcel of undeveloped property outside of lafayette louisiana there is a mortgage on the grand forks north dakota building with an outstanding balance as of december 31 2003 of 01 million there are no outstanding mortgages on our other owned properties set forth below is information relating to our office locations as of december 31 2003 summarized by business segment

 our operating leases expire on various dates these leases generally contain renewal options and escalation clauses based on increases in the lessors’ operating expenses and other charges we expect that most leases will be renewed or replaced upon expiration from time to time we may have unused space and seek to sublet such space to third parties depending on the demand for office space in the locations involved see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our lease commitments 




 i tem 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in numerous pending or threatened proceedings by or against us or one or more of our subsidiaries that arise in the ordinary course of business the damages that may be claimed in these various proceedings are substantial including in many instances claims for punitive or extraordinary damages some of these claims and lawsuits have been resolved others are in the process of being resolved and others are still in the investigation or discovery phase we will continue to respond appropriately to these claims and lawsuits and to vigorously protect our interests 

although the ultimate outcome of the matters referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us or our subsidiaries on the basis of present information availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 

as previously reported the decision of the georgia superior court that rendered summary judgment in our favor in the action captioned gresham  associates inc v anthony t strianese et al  filed on january 19 2000 in henry county georgia was appealed by the plaintiff the complaint originally named us and certain of our subsidiaries and employees as defendants and alleged among other things that we tortiously interfered with contractual relationships and otherwise engaged in anticompetitive activities and sought compensatory and punitive damages in excess of 10000000 on january 27 2004 the summary judgment was affirmed by the appellate court on all counts except one count alleged against one of our employees the time for appeal of the appellate court’s decision has expired in light of these developments we no longer believe that this matter should be considered a potentially material pending legal proceeding

rocktenn company accounted for 86 and 84 of the total value of availableforsale marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities and certificates of deposit as of december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively rocktenn company’s closing stock price at december 31 2003 and 2002 was 1726 and 1348 respectively our exposure to equity price risk is primarily related to the rocktenn company investment as of december 31 2003 the value of the rocktenn company investment was 9665000 

to hedge the risk of increasing interest rates from january 2 2002 through the remaining six years of our sevenyear 90 million term loan on december 5 2001 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted the floating rate interest payments based on a london interbank offering rate “libor” to fixed interest rate payments at 453 this agreement did not impact or change the required 050 to 100 credit risk spread portion of the term loan we do not otherwise enter into derivatives swaps or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

 item 9 c hanges in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosur e 

on june 14 2002 our board of directors upon the recommendation of our audit committee decided no longer to engage arthur andersen llp “andersen” and decided to engage deloitte  touche llp to serve as our independent public accountants 

andersen’s audit report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty audit scope or accounting principles 

for the year ended december 31 2001 and through june 14 2002 there were no disagreements with andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of andersen would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with their report 

none of the reportable events described under item 304a1v of regulation sk occurred within our two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period through june 19 2002 we provided andersen with a copy of the above disclosures a copy of andersen’s letter dated june 19 2002 stating its agreement with such statements was filed as exhibit 16 to our form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2002 




 i tem 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation as required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act the “evaluation” under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures “disclosure controls” as defined in rule 13a15 and 15d15 under the exchange act based on the evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that subject to the limitations noted herein our disclosure controls are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic sec reports 

changes in internal controls 

there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2003 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect those controls 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

service division 

  

  

  

at december 31 2002 our services division employed approximately 311 persons and consisted of subsidiaries that provide the following services 1 insurancerelated services as a thirdparty administrator and consultant for employee health and welfare benefit plans 2 insurancerelated services providing comprehensive risk management and thirdparty administration to insurance entities and selffunded or fullyinsured workers compensation and liability plans and 3 certified managed care and utilization management services for both insurance programs and selffunded plans 

  

  

  

in connection with its employee benefit plan administrative services the services division provides thirdparty administration and consulting related to benefit plan design and costing arrangement for the placement of stoploss insurance and other employee benefit coverages and settlement of claims services division units also provide utilization management services such as preadmission review concurrentretrospective review pretreatment review of certain nonhospital treatment plans and medical and psychiatric case management in addition to the administration of selffunded health care plans this unit offers administration of flexible benefit plans including plan design employee communication enrollment and reporting 

  

  

  

the services divisions workers compensation and liability thirdparty administration includes claim administration access to major reinsurance markets cost containment consulting services for secondary disability and subrogation recoveries and risk management services such as loss control in 2002 our largest workers compensation contract represented approximately 334 of our workers compensation thirdparty administration revenues or approximately 12 of our total commission and fee revenues in addition the services division provides managed care services certified by the american accreditation health care commission which include medical networks case management and utilization review services 

  

  

  

brokerage division 

  

  

  

the brokerage division markets excess and surplus commercial insurance and reinsurance to retail agencies primarily in the southeastern united states as well as throughout the united states including through our retail division the brokerage division represents various us and uk surplus lines companies and is also a lloyds of london correspondent in addition to surplus lines insurance companies the brokerage division represents admitted insurance companies for smaller agencies that do not have access to large insurance company representation excess and surplus products include commercial automobile garage restaurant builders risk and inland marine lines difficulttoinsure general liability and products liability coverages are a specialty as is excess workers compensation coverage retail agency business is solicited through mailings and direct contact with retail agency representatives at december 31 2002 the brokerage division employed approximately 201 persons 

  

  

  

in september 2001 we established brown  brown re inc a subsidiary based in stamford connecticut that specializes in treaty and facultative reinsurance brokerage services 

  

  

  

employees 

  

  

  

at december 31 2002 we had approximately 3384 employees we have contracts with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions restricting their right to solicit our customers and employees after termination of employment with us the enforceability of such contracts varies from state to state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual circumstances the majority of these contracts are terminable by either party however the agreements not to solicit our customers and employees generally continue for a period of two or three years after employment termination 

  

  

  

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

  

  

  

competition 

  

  

  

the insurance agency and brokerage business is highly competitive and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance companies although we are the largest insurance agency and brokerage headquartered in the southeastern united states and were ranked in 2002 based on 2001 revenues as the nations sixth largest by business insurance magazine a number of firms with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us in the southeastern united states and elsewhere this situation is particularly pronounced outside of florida competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation quality of service and price 

  

  

  

a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines business to date such direct writing has had little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is commercially oriented 

  

  

  

in addition to the extent that the grammleachbliley financial services modernization act of 1999 and regulations recently enacted thereunder permit banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate the financial services industry may experience further consolidation which in turn could result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions including competition for acquisition candidates 

  

  

  

regulation licensing and agency contracts 

  

  

  

we or our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents by state regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations and licensing laws vary in individual states and are often complex 

  

  

  

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists that we or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to penalties by a particular state

item 1  business

general

we are the largest insurance agency and brokerage headquartered in the
southeastern united states and the eighth largest in the country based on 2000
total revenues the name of the company following the 1993 combination of brown
 brown inc which commenced doing business in 1939 and poe  associates
inc which commenced doing business in 1959 was poe  brown inc the name was
changed to brown  brown inc in 1999

we market and sell to our clients insurance products and services primarily in
the property and casualty area as an agent and broker we do not assume
underwriting risks instead we provide our clients with quality insurance
contracts as well as other targeted customized risk management products

we are compensated for our services primarily by commissions paid by insurance
companies and fees paid by clients for certain services the commission is
usually a percentage of the premium paid by the insured commission rates
generally depend upon the type of insurance the particular insurance company
and the nature of the services provided by us in some cases a commission is
shared with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a
transaction we may also receive from an insurance company a contingent
commission that is generally based on the profitability and volume of business
placed with it by us over a given period of time fees are principally generated
by our services division which offers thirdparty administration benefit
consulting and managed healthcare services primarily in the workers
compensation and employee benefit markets the amount of our income from
commissions and fees is a function of among other factors continued new
business production retention of existing clients acquisitions and
fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units

premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting industry
has historically been cyclical displaying a high degree of volatility based on
prevailing economic and competitive conditions from the mid1980s through 1999
the property and casualty insurance industry experienced a soft market during
which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded stimulating an
increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions
the effect of this softness in rates on our revenues was somewhat offset by our
acquisitions and new business production as a result of increasing loss
ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expense against
earned premiums of insurance companies through 1999 there was a general
increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing
through the fourth quarter of 2001 although premium increases vary by line of
business geographical region insurance company and specific underwriting
factors we believe this was the first time since 1987 that we operated in an
environment of increased premiums for eight consecutive quarters additionally
in light of the events of september 11 2001 insurance companies as well as
reinsurers may extend this trend of increasing premium rates while we cannot
predict the timing or extent of premium pricing changes as a result of market
fluctuations or their effect on our operations in the future we believe that
premium rates will continue to increase through at least 2002

beginning in 1993 through 2001 we acquired 86 insurance agency operations
excluding acquired books of business that had aggregate estimated annual
revenues of 2400 million for the 12 calendar months immediately following the
date of acquisition of these 26 operations were acquired during 2001 with
aggregate estimated annual revenues of 1480 million for the 12 calendar months
immediately following the date of acquisition including our asset acquisition
of the insurance agency businessrelated assets of riedman corporation
effective january 1 2001



                                       2

with estimated annual revenues of 540 million for the 12 calendar months
immediately following the date of acquisition the large number of acquisitions
in 2001 was largely due to the thenanticipated elimination of
poolingofinterests accounting for stock acquisitions which encouraged the
shareholders of certain agencies especially c corporations to accelerate the
sale of their stock to us as of december 31 2000 our activities were
conducted in 39 locations in 12 states however with the acquisitions
consummated during 2001 we had 140 locations in 28 states

national programs division 3 the services division and 4 the brokerage

the workers compensation and employee benefit selfinsurance markets and
managed healthcare services the brokerage division markets and sells excess and
surplus commercial insurance and reinsurance primarily through independent

employees

at december 31 2001 we had approximately 3000 employees we have contracts
with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions
restricting their right to solicit our clients and employees after termination
of employment with us the enforceability of such contracts varies from state to
state depending upon state statutes judicial decisions and factual
circumstances the majority of these contracts are terminable by either party
however the

                                       6
page

agreements not to solicit our clients and employees generally continue for a
period of two or three years after employment termination

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our
relations with our employees to be satisfactory

competition

the insurance agency and brokerage business is highly competitive and numerous
firms actively compete with us for clients and insurance companies although we
are the largest insurance agency and brokerage headquartered in the southeastern
united states and were ranked in 2001 based on 2000 revenues as the nations
eighth largest by business insurance magazine a number of firms with
substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us in the
southeastern united states and elsewhere this situation is particularly
pronounced outside of florida competition in the insurance business is largely
based on innovation quality of service and price

a number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance
primarily to individuals and do not pay commissions to thirdparty agents and
brokers in addition the internet continues to be a source for direct placement
of personal lines business to date such direct writing has had relatively
little effect on our operations primarily because our retail division is
commercially oriented

in addition to the extent that the grammleachbliley financial services
modernization act of 1999 and regulations recently enacted thereunder permit
banks securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate the financial
services industry may experience further consolidation which in turn could
result in increased competition from diversified financial institutions
including competition for acquisition candidates

regulation licensing and agency contracts

we or our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents by state
regulatory authorities in the states in which we conduct business regulations
and licensing laws vary in individual states and are often complex

the applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to
amendment or reinterpretation by state regulatory authorities and such
authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the
granting revocation suspension and renewal of licenses the possibility exists
that we or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from
carrying on some or all of our activities in or otherwise subjected to
penalties by a particular state

county georgia captioned gresham  associates inc vs anthony t strianese
et al the complaint names us certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates and
two of their employees as defendants the complaint alleges among other things
that we tortiously interfered with the contractual relationship between the
plaintiff and certain of its employees the plaintiff alleges that we hired such
persons and actively encouraged them to violate the restrictive covenants
contained in their employment agreements with plaintiff the complaint seeks
compensatory damages from us with respect to each of the two employees in
amounts not less than 750000 and seeks punitive damages for alleged
intentional wrongdoing in an amount not less than 10000000 the complaint
also sought a declaratory judgment regarding the enforceability of the
restrictive covenants in the employment agreements and an injunction prohibiting
the violation of those agreements the plaintiff subsequently dismissed the
claims for a declaratory judgment and an injunction as well as its claims of
breach of contract against the two individual employees named as defendants
those individuals and peachtree special risk brokers llc one of our
affiliates named as a defendant in this action have filed counterclaims against
the plaintiff seeking damages and seeking a declaratory judgment holding that
the restrictive covenants in the employment agreements are not enforceable we
believe that we have meritorious defenses to each of the claims remaining in
this action and intend to contest this action vigorously

us or one or more of our subsidiaries that involve routine litigation relating
to insurance risks placed by us and other contractual matters our management

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
         results of operations
general

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this report

we are a general insurance agency and brokerage headquartered in daytona beach
and tampa florida since the early 1980s our stated corporate objective has
been to increase our net income per share by at least 15 every year we have
increased revenues from 956 million in 1993 as originally stated without
giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the
poolingofinterests method of accounting to 3650 million in 2001 a compound
annual growth rate of 182 in the same period we increased net income from
80 million as originally stated without giving effect to any subsequent
acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting
to 539 million in 2001 a compound annual growth rate of 269 we have also
increased net income per share 150 or more for nine consecutive years
excluding the effect of a onetime investment gain of 13 million in 1994 and
favorable adjustments to our income tax reserves of 07 million in 1994 and
05 million in 1995 since 1993 excluding the historical impact of poolings
our pretax margins improved in all but one year and in that year the pretax
margin was essentially flat these improvements have resulted primarily from net
new business growth new business production offset by lost business and
continued operating efficiencies our growth in 2001 was primarily the result of
a higher than historical number of acquisitions driven in large part by the
thenanticipated elimination of poolingofinterests accounting treatment for
acquisitions coupled with a general increase in premium rates and stronger net
new business growth

our revenues are comprised principally of commissions paid by insurance
companies fees paid directly by clients and investment income commission
revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and
are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by
insurance underwriters and the insureds underlying insurable exposure units
which are units that insurers use to measure or express insurance exposed to
risk such as property values sales and payroll levels so as to determine what
premium to charge the policyholder these premium rates are established by
insurance companies based upon many factors including reinsurance rates none
of which we control beginning in 1987 and continuing through 1999 revenues
were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting
from intense competition among property and casualty insurers for market share
among other factors this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates
commonly referred to as a soft market generally resulted in flat to reduced
commissions on renewal business the effect of this softness in rates on our
revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and new business production
as a result of increasing loss ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus
adjustment expense against earned premiums of insurance companies through
1999 there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first
quarter of 2000 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2001 although
premium rates vary by line of business geographical region insurance company
and specific underwriting factors we believe this was the first time since
1987 that we operated in an environment of increased premiums for eight
consecutive quarters additionally in light of the events of september 11
2001 insurance companies as well as reinsurers may extend this trend of
increasing premium rates while we cannot predict the timing or extent of
premium pricing changes as a result of market fluctuations or their effect on
our operations in the future we believe that premium rates will continue to
increase through at least 2002

the volume of business from new and existing clients fluctuations in insurable
exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions
further impact our revenues for example stagnant rates of inflation and the
general decline of economic activity in recent years have generally limited the
increases in the values of insurable exposure units conversely the increasing
costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some clients to seek
higher levels of insurance coverage still our revenues continue to grow
through acquisitions and an intense focus


                                      14
page

on net new business growth we anticipate that results of operations for 2002
will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions

we also earn contingent commissions which are revenuesharing commissions
from insurance companies based upon the volume and the growth andor
profitability of the business placed with such companies during the prior year
these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of
each year and over the last three years have averaged approximately 46 of
total commissions and fees contingent commissions are included in our total
commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year
received the term core commissions and fees excludes contingent commissions
and represents the revenues earned directly from each specific insurance policy
sold or from feebased services rendered

fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division which provides
insurancerelated services including thirdparty administration consulting for
the workers compensation and employee benefit selfinsurance markets and
managed healthcare services in each of the past three years fee revenues
generated by the services division have averaged approximately 68 of total
commissions and fees

investment income consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and
advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being
remitted to insurance companies our policy is to invest available funds in
highquality shortterm fixed income investment securities investment income
also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments

acquisitions and the impact of the poolingofinterests method of accounting

during 2001 we acquired the following 12 agency groups in stockforstock
transactions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting

 the huval companies

 spencer  associates inc and san of east central florida inc

 the young agency inc

 layne  associates ltd

 agency of insurance professionals inc compvantage insurance agency llc and
agency of indian programs insurance llc

 finwall  associates insurance inc

 the connelly insurance group inc

 the benefit group inc

 logan insurance agency inc and automobile insurance agency of virginia inc

 froelichpaulsonmoore inc and mj buildings llc

 mckinnon  mooney inc

 raleigh schwarz  powell inc

we also acquired the assets of 12 general insurance agencies several books of
business client accounts and the outstanding stock of two general insurance
agencies in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting

                                       15
page

during 2000 we acquired the following four agency groups in stockforstock
transactions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting

 bowers schumann  welch

 the flagship group ltd

 wmh inc and huffman  associates inc

 mangus insurance  bonding inc

we also acquired the assets of five general insurance agencies several books of
business and the outstanding stock of two general insurance agencies in
transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting

during 1999 we acquired the following two agency groups in stockforstock
transactions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method of accounting

 ampher insurance inc and ross insurance of florida inc

 signature insurance group inc and csd a florida general partnership

we also acquired the assets of seven general insurance agencies several books
of business and the outstanding stock of three general insurance agencies in
transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting

the revenues and expenses of entities that were acquired and accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting are recognized only from the date of
acquisition and therefore did not impact our previously reported historical
results however the applicable accounting rules require that our consolidated
financial statements be restated for all periods to include the results of
operations financial positions and cash flows of entities acquired in
transactions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method because most
of the pooled entities were operated as privatelyheld companies that paid
significant yearend bonuses and compensation to their principals and owners
during the periods prior to our acquisition of such entities the combination of
their lower net income results with our results diluted our historically
reported profit margins defined as income before income taxes and minority
interest as a percentage of total revenues as restated our profit margins were
248 204 and 200 in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively without giving
effect to any acquisitions accounted for under the poolingofinterests method
in the year of acquisition or in any prior year our profit margins were 279
274 and 262 in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively we believe that as we
continue to integrate these acquired entities our profit margins will continue
to improve

the poolingofinterests method of accounting has been eliminated for all
business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 this change in accounting
rules was the impetus for many of our acquisitions in 2001 the pace of our
ongoing acquisition activities may be significantly slower than it was in 2001
although we will continue to seek qualified acquisition candidates future
acquisitions will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting see
note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements

see notes 2 and 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a
description of our acquisitions

the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and
liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999

commissions and fees

commissions and fees increased 39 in 2001 12 in 2000 and 9 in 1999 core
commissions and fees increased 113 in 2001 111 in 2000 and 04 in 1999
excluding commissions and fees generated from operations acquired that were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and excluding divested
operations the 2001 and 2000 results reflect stronger premium rate increases
that began in the first quarter of 2000 and continued through 2001
additionally the 2001 increase was impacted by the higher than historical
number of acquisitions consummated during that year during 1999 property and
casualty insurance premium prices declined from the previous year and this
decline was primarily responsible for the lower growth rate

investment income

investment income decreased to 37 million in 2001 compared with 49 million
in 2000 and 35 million in 1999 the decrease in 2001 is primarily a result of
lower available investment cash balances due to increased acquisition activity
although lower investment yields also contributed to reduced income the
increase in 2000 was primarily a result of higher levels of invested cash
investment income also included gains of approximately 03 million in 2001
02 million in 2000 and 01 million in 1999 realized from the sale of
investments in various equity securities and partnership interests

other income

other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and
disposition of assets in 2001 gains of 08 million were recognized from the
sale of client accounts that were primarily related to the auto dealer
protector planr based in central florida gains from the sale of client
accounts were 01 million in 2000 compared with gains of 04 million in 1999
this decrease from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to the gain on sales of
certain accounts in 1999 within the lawyers protector planr of our national
programs division

employee compensation  benefits

employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 25 in 2001 14 in
2000 and 10 in 1999 primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in
commissions paid to new and existing employees employee compensation and
benefits as a percentage of total revenues was 51 in 2001 56 in 2000 and 55
in 1999 the percentages are higher in 2000 and 1999 due to higher compensation
and yearend bonuses paid to the principals and owners of pooled entities prior
to the dates of acquisition we had approximately 3000 fulltime employees at
december 31 2001 compared with approximately 2140 at december 31 2000 and
approximately 2000 at december 31 1999

other operating expenses

other operating expenses increased 28 in 2001 6 in 2000 and 2 in 1999
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 16 in
2001 from 17 in 2000 and 18 in 1999 the continuing decline in other operating
expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenues is attributable to the
effective cost containment measures brought about by an initiative designed to
identify areas of excess expense and to the fact that in an increasing premium
rate environment certain significant other operating expenses such as office
rent office supplies and

                                       17
page

telephone costs increase at a slower rate than commission and fee revenues
increase during the same period

depreciation

depreciation increased 6 in 2001 5 in 2000 and 13 in 1999 these increases
were primarily due to the purchase of new computer equipment and the
depreciation associated with acquired assets

amortization

amortization expense increased 66 million or 72 in 2001 09 million or
11 in 2000 and 20 million or 32 in 1999 the increase each year is due
to the additional amortization of intangibles as a result of new acquisitions
see notes 1 3 and 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements

interest expense

interest expense increased 44 million or 350 in 2001 and decreased 09
million or 7 in 2000 on january 3 2001 we obtained a 90 million term
loan primarily to acquire the insurance agency businessrelated assets of
riedman corporation which accounts for the increase in 2001 the average london
interbank offered rate libor for the interest paid on that loan in 2001 was
44 effective january 2 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement
to lock in an effective fixed interest rate of 453 for the remaining six years
of the term loan excluding our credit risk spread additional interest paid
to offset risk of default between 05 and 10 the decrease in 2000 was the
result of reduced outstanding debt

noncash stock grant compensation

noncash stock grant compensation expense represents the expense required to be
recorded under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock
issued to employees relating to our stock performance plan which is more
fully described in note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial
statements

the annual cost of this stock performance plan increases only when our average
stock price over a 20 trading day period increases by increments of 20 or more
from the price at the time of the original grant or when more shares are
granted and the stock price increases

during 2001 after the first vesting condition for most of the previously
granted performance stock was satisfied as a result of increases in our average
stock price over a 20 trading day period we granted additional shares of
performance stock with the awards granted in 2001 and the increase in our stock
price during that year the expense for the stock performance plan increased to
20 million in 2001 from 05 million in 2000 if our stock price continues to
increase in 2002 this expense could increase to as much as 30 million
excluding the cost of any new shares granted

income taxes

the effective tax rate on income from operations was 385 in 2001 373 in
2000 and 386 in 1999

results of operationssegment information

as discussed in note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements
we operate in four business segments the retail national programs services
and brokerage divisions

the retail division is our insurance agency business that provides a broad range
of insurance products and services to commercial governmental professional and
individual clients over 95 of the retail divisions revenues are
commissionbased as a majority of our operating expenses do not change as
premiums fluctuate we believe that a majority of any fluctuation in commissions
received by us will be reflected in our pretax income the retail divisions
revenues accounted for 77 to 80 of our total consolidated commissions and fees
over the last three years the retail divisions total revenues in 2001
increased 880 million to 2876 million a 441 increase over 2000 of this
increase approximately 698 million related to commissions and fees from
acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting that had no
comparable revenues in 2000 the remaining increase is primarily due to net new
business growth which benefited from rising premium rates during 2001 income
before income taxes and minority interest in 2001 increased 219 million to
520 million a 727 increase over 2000 this increase is due to acquired
revenues increases in premium rates and the lack of comparable yearend bonuses
paid in 2000 related to the pooled entities total revenues in 2000 increased
170 million to 1995 million a 93 increase over 1999 this increase is
primarily due to net new business growth and rising premium rates during 2000
income before income taxes and minority interest in 2000 increased 20 million
to 301 million a 68 increase over 1999 this increase is due to net new
business growth acquired revenues and rising premium rates

the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs
which provides professional liability and related package products for certain
professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents and
special programs which markets targeted products and services designated for
specific industries trade groups and market niches similar to the retail
division essentially all of the national programs divisions revenues are
commissionbased total revenues in 2001 increased 70 million to 438
million an 189 increase over 2000 of which 24 million was related to net
new business growth all of this net new business growth was related to our
special programs division but was partially offset by the loss of approximately
34 million of auto industryrelated business that was terminated revenues
related to our professional programs division were essentially flat for 2001
however prior to 2001 we experienced at least three years of 10 to 20 of
annual revenue declines in this business income before income taxes and
minority interest in 2001 increased 29 million to 179 million a 196
increase over 2000 due primarily to net increases in revenues total revenues
in 2000 increased 42 million to 368 million a 128 increase over 1999 due
to net new business growth in the special programs division which was partially
offset by an 117 decline in the professional programs division income before
income taxes and minority interest in 2000 increased 26 million to 149
million a 207 increase over 1999 primarily due to revenue increases in
special programs

the services division provides insurancerelated services including thirdparty
administration consulting for the workers compensation and employee benefit
selfinsurance markets and managed healthcare services unlike our other
segments over 90 of the services divisions revenues are fees which are not
significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums the
services divisions total revenues in 2001 increased 33 million to 250
million a 154 increase over 2000 of this increase 23 million was the
result of net new business growth and the remaining portion was acquired income
before income taxes and minority interest in 2001 increased 09 million to 40
million a 293 increase over 2000 primarily due to strong net new business
growth total revenues in 2000 increased 45 million to 216 million a 266
increase

                                      19
page

over 1999 of this increase 27 million was the result of net new business
growth and the remaining portion was acquired income before income taxes and
minority interest in 2000 increased 05 million to 31 million a 188
increase over 1999 again due primarily to strong net new business growth

the brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance
and reinsurance primarily through independent agents and brokers similar to
our retail and national programs divisions essentially all of the brokerage
divisions revenues are commissionbased total brokerage revenues in 2001
increased 42 million to 122 million a 531 increase over 2000 due
entirely to net new business growth as a result of the brokerage divisions
strong net new business growth income before income taxes and minority interest
in 2001 increased 14 million to 41 million a 515 increase over 2000
brokerage revenue in 2000 increased 16 million to 80 million a 246
increase over 1999 solely due to net new business growth income before income
taxes and minority interest for 2000 increased 06 million to 27 million a
273 increase over 1999 again due to net new business growth

liquidity and capital resources

our cash and cash equivalents of 160 million at december 31 2001 reflects a
decrease of 210 million from our december 31 2000 balance of 370 million
during 2001 700 million of cash was provided from operating activities and
901 million was received from longterm debt financing from this borrowing
and existing cash balances 1310 million was used for acquisitions 333
million was used to repay longterm debt 97 million was used to pay dividends
and 110 million was used for additions to fixed assets

our cash and cash equivalents of 370 million at december 31 2000 reflects an
increase of 23 million from the december 31 1999 balance of 347 million
during 2000 423 million of cash

                                      20

was provided from operating activities and 05 million was received from
longterm debt financing from this financing and existing cash balances 177
million was used for acquisitions 55 million was used for purchases of our
stock 45 million was used to repay longterm debt 75 million was used to
pay dividends and 56 million was used for additions to fixed assets

our cash and cash equivalents of 347 million at december 31 1999 reflects a
decrease of 56 million from the december 31 1998 balance of 404 million
during 1999 442 million of cash was provided from operating activities and
07 million was received from longterm debt financing from this financing and
existing cash balances 162 million was used for acquisitions 12 million
was used for purchases of our stock 179 million was used to repay longterm
debt 62 million was used to pay dividends and 62 million was used for
additions to fixed assets

our ratio of current assets to current liabilities the current ratio was
078 and 094 at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in the
current ratio in 2001 is primarily attributable to the use of cash and increased
debt to fund the higher level of acquisition activity

in january 2001 we entered into a 90 million sevenyear term loan agreement
with suntrust banks inc borrowings under this facility bear interest based
upon the 30 60 or 90day libor plus a margin ranging from 050 to 100
depending upon our quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest
taxes depreciation and amortization ninetyday libor was 188 as of december
31 2001 the loan was fully funded on january 3 2001 and a balance of 771
million remained outstanding as of december 31 2001 this loan is to be repaid
in equal quarterly principal installments of 32 million through december 2007
effective january 2 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with
suntrust banks inc to lock in an effective fixed interest rate of 453 for
the remaining six years of the term loan excluding our credit risk spread
between 050 and 100

we also have a revolving credit facility with suntrust banks inc that provides
for available borrowings of up to 50 million with a maturity date of october
2002 borrowings under this facility bear interest based upon the 30 60 or
90day libor plus a margin ranging from 045 to 100 depending upon our
quarterly ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation
and amortization a commitment fee of 015 to 025 per year is assessed on the
unused balance as noted above 90day libor was 188 as of december 31 2001
there were no borrowings under this facility at december 31 2001 or december
31 2000

we continue to maintain our credit agreement with continental casualty company
cna under which 20 million the maximum amount available for borrowing was
outstanding at december 31 2001 the available amount will decrease by 10
million each august through 2003

all three of our credit agreements require us to maintain certain financial
ratios and comply with certain other covenants we were in compliance with all
such covenants as of december 31 2001

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investment
portfolio funds generated from operations and the availability of the bank line
of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs through at
least the end of 2002 additionally we believe that funds generated from future
operations will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs including
the required annual principal payments on our longterm debt

in december 2001 a universal shelf registration statement that we filed with
the securities and exchange commission covering the public offering and sale
from time to time of up to an aggregate of 250 million of debt andor equity
securities was declared effective the primary use of this capital would be to
fund acquisitions

interest rate risk and equity price risk the fair values of our cash and cash
equivalents restricted cash and certificates of deposit at december 31 2001
and 2000 approximated their respective carrying values due to their shortterm
duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material
