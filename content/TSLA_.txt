our core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain we have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable efficient reliable and costeffective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment we offer dual motor powertrain vehicles which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an allwheel drive configuration as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of model s and model x 

among other things we maintain extensive testing and rd capabilities for battery cells packs and systems and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithiumion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics in order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower costs we are currently using our expertise to develop a new proprietary lithiumion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes 

vehicle control and infotainment software 

the performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software control systems in our vehicles optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging and control all infotainment functions we develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through overtheair updates 

selfdriving development 

we have expertise in developing technologies systems and software to enable selfdriving vehicles using primarily visionbased sensors our fsd computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for realworld performance 

currently we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our autopilot and fsd options although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit as with other vehicle systems we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through overtheair updates 

we intend to establish in the future an autonomous tesla ridehailing network which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve 

energy generation and storage 

energy storage products 

we leverage many of the componentlevel technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products by taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products additionally our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fastacting systems for power injection and absorption we have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems 

solar energy systems 

we have engineered solar roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation the efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter which also incorporates our power electronics technologies we designed both products to integrate with powerwall

sales and marketing 

historically we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products and we believe we will continue to do so such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs 

automotive 

direct sales 

our vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of companyowned stores in some jurisdictions we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles we believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing educate consumers about electric vehicles maintain and strengthen the tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback 

we reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a locationbylocation level from time to time to optimize our current sales channels sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to volatility from time to time 

used vehicle sales 

our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the tradein of a customer’s existing tesla or nontesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used tesla vehicle the tesla and nontesla vehicles we acquire as tradeins are subsequently remarketed either directly by us or through third parties we also remarket used tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns 

public charging 

we have a growing global network of tesla superchargers which are our industrial grade highspeed vehicle chargers where possible we colocate superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power supercharger stations are typically placed along welltraveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick reliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient minimal stops use of the supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs 

we also work with a wide variety of hospitality retail and public destinations as well as businesses with commuting employees to offer additional charging options for our customers these destination charging and workplace locations deploy tesla wall connectors to provide charging to tesla vehicle owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses we also work with singlefamily homeowners and multifamily residential entities to deploy home charging solutions 

  

inapp upgrades 

as our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely overtheair our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the tesla app or through the invehicle user interface we expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future 

energy generation and storage 

we market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of channels we emphasize simplicity standardization and accessibility to make it easy and costeffective for customers to adopt clean energy while reducing our customer acquisition costs 

in the us we offer residential solar and energy storage products directly through our website stores and galleries as well as through our network of channel partners outside of the us we use our international sales organization and a network of channel partners to market and sell these products for the residential market we also sell powerwall directly to utilities in the case of products sold to utilities or channel partners such partners typically sell the product to residential customers and manage the installation in customer homes 

we sell our commercial and utilityscale energy storage systems to customers through our us and international sales organization and our channel partner network in certain jurisdictions we also sell installed solar energy systems with or without energy storage to commercial customers through ppa transactions

manufacturing 

manufacturing facilities in the bay area california 

we manufacture and test our vehicles at our manufacturing facilities in the bay area in california including the fremont factory and other local manufacturing facilities we also manufacture and develop certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards such as model s and model x battery packs and our proprietary lithiumion battery cells at these locations 

gigafactory nevada near reno nevada 

our battery material cell module and battery pack production for model 3 model y and our energy products are manufactured in one location at gigafactory nevada in addition we manufacture vehicle drive units and energy storage components there gigafactory nevada allows us to access high volumes of lithiumion battery cells manufactured by our partner panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs we continue to invest in gigafactory nevada to achieve additional output there 

gigafactory new york in buffalo new york 

we use gigafactory new york for the development and production of our solar roof and other solar products and components energy storage components and supercharger components and for other functions 

gigafactory shanghai in china 

we established gigafactory shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs we continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there gigafactory shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories as we implemented the learnings from our model 3 and model y ramp at the fremont factory to commence and ramp our production at gigafactory shanghai quickly and costeffectively 

other manufacturing 

generally we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities we also intend to further increase costcompetitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing including at gigafactory berlin in germany and gigafactory texas in austin texas which will begin production in 2022 

supply chain 

our products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world we have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells electronics and complex vehicle assemblies certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale 

as is the case for most automotive companies most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers where multiple sources are available for certain key components we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply we also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times 

  

our products use various raw materials including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control such as supply and demand and market speculation we strive to execute longterm supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies in order to meet the needs of our operations 

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

globally both the operation of our business by us and the ownership of our products by our customers are impacted by various government programs incentives and other arrangements our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions 

programs and incentives 

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives 

we have agreements with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority that provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of electric vehicles and powertrain production in california thus reducing our cost basis in the related assets in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

gigafactory nevada—nevada tax incentives 

in connection with the construction of gigafactory nevada we entered into agreements with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at gigafactory nevada these incentives are available until june 2024 or june 2034 depending on the incentive and primarily offset related costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

gigafactory new york—new york state investment and lease

as we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at gigafactory new york pursuant to a new york state executive order issued in march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we were granted a deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets through december 31 2021 in an amendment memorialized in august 2021 as of december 31 2021 we are in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the state of new york and buffalo 

gigafactory shanghai—land use rights and economic benefits 

we have an agreement with the local government of shanghai for land use rights at gigafactory shanghai under the terms of the arrangement we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023 in addition the shanghai government has granted to our gigafactory shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at gigafactory shanghai these incentives offset the related costs of our facilities in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k finally the shanghai government granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15 to certain eligible enterprises which is lower than the 25 statutory corporate income tax rate in china our gigafactory shanghai subsidiary was granted this lower rate for 2019 through 2023 this lower tax rate reduces the income tax provision in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

gigafactory texas – tax incentives 

in connection with the construction of gigafactory texas we entered into a 20year agreement with travis county in texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 7080 of property taxes paid by us to travis county and a separate 10year agreement with the del valle independent school district in texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at gigafactory texas these incentives will offset the related costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

automotive regulatory credits 

we earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zeroemission vehicles “zevs” greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel we sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

energy storage system incentives and policies 

while the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage 

for example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energyrelated us federal tax credits described below the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets in addition california and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behindthemeter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs in certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration in such transactions they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

solar energy system incentives and policies 

us federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates 

in particular sections 48 and 25d of the us internal revenue code currently provide a tax credit of 26 of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems these tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to decline andor expire in 2023 and beyond 

regulations 

vehicle safety and testing 

in the us our vehicles are subject to regulation by the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” including all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards “fmvss” and the nhtsa bumper standard numerous fmvss apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness and occupant protection requirements while our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable fmvss with limited or no exemptions fmvss are subject to change from time to time as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable fmvss and the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the us 

we are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by nhtsa including the cafe standards theft prevention act requirements labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting the us automobile information and disclosure act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings as determined by the us department of transportation and the environmental protection agency the “epa” and new car assessment program ratings as determined by nhtsa if available 

our vehicles sold outside of the us are subject to similar foreign compliance safety environmental and other regulations many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the us and may require redesign andor retesting some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features additionally the european union established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020 

selfdriving vehicles 

generally laws pertaining to selfdriving vehicles are evolving globally and in some cases may create restrictions on features that we develop while there are currently no federal us regulations specifically pertaining to selfdriving vehicles or selfdriving equipment nhtsa has published recommended guidelines on selfdriving vehicles and retains the authority to investigate andor take action on the safety of any vehicle equipment or features operating on public roads certain us states also have legal restrictions on the operation registration or licensure of selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them this regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to selfdriving vehicles in the us 

  

in markets that follow the regulations of the united nations economic commission for europe some requirements restrict the design of advanced driverassistance or selfdriving features which can compromise or prevent their use entirely other applicable laws both current and proposed may hinder the path and timeline to introducing selfdriving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply 

other key markets including china continue to consider selfdriving regulation any implemented regulations may differ materially from those in the us and europe which may further increase the legal complexity of selfdriving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation 

in the us state laws regulate the manufacture distribution sale and service of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state in certain such states we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur 

some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations we expect such challenges to continue and we intend to actively fight any such efforts 

battery safety and testing 

our battery packs are subject to various us and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation we conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations 

we use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products the use storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future we have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs and we are also piloting our own recycling technology 

solar energy—general 

we are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity to operate our systems we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases and ppas have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions 

solar energy—net metering 

most states in the us make net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so 

competition 

automotive 

the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader crosssection of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles’ capabilities 

  

we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology for example model s and model x compete primarily with premium sedans and premium suvs and model 3 and model y compete with small to mediumsized sedans and compact suvs which are extremely competitive markets competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers however many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the us china and europe and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles in addition several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles including plugin versions 

we also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering selfdriving technologies charging solutions and other features and services and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our autopilot fsd and neural network capabilities supercharger network and our infotainment offerings 

energy generation and storage 

energy storage systems 

the market for energy storage products is also highly competitive and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems we compete with these companies based on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specifications and features of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets 

solar energy systems 

the primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers we compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems we also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations we believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems 

intellectual property 

we place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio as part of our business we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other measures including through employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements for example we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio we have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world 

environmental social and governance esg and human capital resources 

esg 

the very purpose of teslas existence is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy we believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal as we expand we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one including with respect to waste reduction and water usage and we are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain 

we are committed to only sourcing responsibly produced materials and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains we have a zerotolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the organization for economic cooperation and development due diligence guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve we are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement as our production volumes increase our incidents per vehicle continue to drop 

  

we believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals including with respect to esg we continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics our esg sustainability council is made up of leaders from across our company and regularly presents to our board of directors which oversees our esg impacts initiatives and priorities 

human capital resources 

as of december 31 2021 our fulltime count for our and our subsidiaries’ employees worldwide was 99290 to date we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values 

we want to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees our efforts begin at the entry level with development apprenticeship and internship programs in local high schools community colleges and fouryear colleges in addition we seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree and have provided thousands of job openings including in our local communities for capable workers from various backgrounds to learn valuable skills in critical operations such as in manufacturing vehicle service and energy product installation we also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development our goal is a longterm upwardbound career at tesla for every employee which we believe also drives our retention efforts 

our ability to retain our talented workforce is correlated to our compensation practices and culture of open communication we provide a highly competitive wage that meets or exceeds that of comparable manufacturing roles even before equity and benefits are factored in in addition the majority of our employees have the opportunity to receive additional tesla equity each year based on their performance we continue to review salary and wages against benchmarks and adjust to ensure wages are competitive and have instituted a robust process for ensuring pay equity across our organization in addition we provide a comprehensive range of benefits options including nocost paycheck contributions for medical dental and vision plan options for employees and family members 

our employees have the right to freely discuss their wages benefits and terms and conditions of employment and to raise complaints internally and externally we encourage our employees to bring any concerns or complaints they have to any member of management and any employee who is subjected to a witness or has knowledge of any conduct that violates tesla policies is asked to immediately report the conduct our employees can report concerns to their supervisor or human resources partner as well as an integrity line to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation that is available 24 hours a day seven days a week concerns are reviewed in accordance with established protocols by investigators with expertise who also periodically review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls tesla provides employee training on workplace conduct at least annually and in 2021 implemented a campaign to rehighlight different reporting mechanisms available to employees 

we also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe respectful fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business from our outreach to historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions to sponsoring employee resource groups across numerous locations including asian pacific islanders at tesla black at tesla intersectionality latinos at tesla lgbtq at tesla veterans at tesla and women in tesla we engage these networks as key business resources and sources of actionable feedback we are also working on diversity efforts in our supply chain to expand our outreach and support to small and largescale suppliers from underrepresented communities to emphasize this culture with our own employees

 item 1arisk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our ability to grow our business 

we may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global covid19 pandemic 

since the first quarter of 2020 there has been a worldwide impact from the covid19 pandemic government regulations and shifting social behaviors have limited or closed nonessential transportation government functions business activities and persontoperson interactions in some cases the relaxation of such trends has been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce including in parts of the us and the rest of the world 

during 2020 we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide and certain of our suppliers also shut down operations temporarily or permanently including during the recently reimposed lockdowns in certain parts of the world we instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our us operations were scaled back temporary impediments to administrative activities supporting our operations also hampered our product deliveries and deployments 

global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have longlasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic for example pandemicrelated issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts similarly increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors which has caused challenges in our supply chain and production in addition labor shortages resulting from the pandemic including worker absenteeism may lead to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and service workers as well as increased labor costs sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation including for travel and visa allowances the contingencies inherent in the construction of and ramp at new facilities such as gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas may be exacerbated by these challenges 

we cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly if we experience unfavorable global market conditions or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again our business prospects financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

we may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs 

we have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features for example we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first model x and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial model 3 manufacturing processes in addition we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features 

in particular our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of massmarket vehicles including model 3 and model y which we are planning to achieve through multiple factories worldwide we have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing model 3 and model y at high volumes and even less experience building and ramping vehicle production lines across multiple factories in different geographies in order to be successful we will need to implement maintain and ramp efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in california nevada texas china and germany we will also need to hire train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs if we are not successful in achieving these goals we could face delays in establishing andor sustaining our model 3 and model y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets 

we may also experience similar future delays in launching andor ramping production of our energy storage products and solar roof new product versions or variants such as the recently updated model s and model x new vehicles such as tesla semi cybertruck and the new tesla roadster and future features and services based on artificial intelligence such as new autopilot or fsd 

  

functionalities the autonomous tesla ridehailing network and robotics likewise we may encounter delays with the design construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products 

any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future products features and services or in doing so costeffectively and with high quality may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to grow our global product sales delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth 

our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities we are targeting with model 3 and model y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products we currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region likewise as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets 

because we do not have independent dealer networks we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers we may face difficulties with deliveries at increasing volumes particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times for example we saw challenges in ramping our logistics channels in china and europe to initially deliver model 3 there in the first quarter of 2019 we have deployed a number of delivery models such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally likewise as we ramp our energy products we are working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities if we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand our business financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

moreover because of our unique expertise with our vehicles we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals if we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles particularly highervolume and relatively newer additions to our fleet such as model 3 and model y it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory similarly the increasing number of tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world 

there is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales delivery installation servicing and vehicle charging targets globally that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations these plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them as we expand we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale installation and servicing of our products the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of superchargers if we fail to manage our growth effectively it may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive cyclical and volatile 

if the market for electric vehicles in general and tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other our business prospects financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

we are still at an earlier stage of development and have limited resources and production relative to established competitors that offer internal combustion engine vehicles in addition electric vehicles still comprise a small percentage of overall vehicle sales as a result the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors such as 

• perceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost 

• perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge and access to charging facilities 

• competition including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles plugin hybrid electric vehicles and high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles 

• volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020 

• government regulations and economic incentives and 

• concerns about our future viability 

  

finally the target demographics for our vehicles particularly model 3 and model y are highly competitive sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to further volatility 

our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules prices quality and volumes that are acceptable to us or we may be unable to manage these components effectively 

our products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers including singlesource direct suppliers which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars trade policies natural disasters such as the march 2011 earthquakes in japan health epidemics such as the global covid19 pandemic trade and shipping disruptions port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational for example a global shortage of semiconductors has been reported since early 2021 and has caused challenges in the manufacturing industry and impacted our supply chain and production as well we have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate the challenges caused by these shortages but there is no guarantee we may be able to continually do so as we scale production to meet our growth targets additionally if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers the unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays idle manufacturing facilities product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts moreover significant increases in our production such as for model 3 and model y or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time our suppliers may not be willing or able to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost quality and volume needs or to do so may cost us more which may require us to replace them with other sources finally we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the fremont factory and we may experience issues increasing the level of localized procurement at our gigafactory shanghai and at future factories such as gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all additionally we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce especially in light of the increases in materials pricing any of these occurrences may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

as the scale of our vehicle production increases we will also need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which may harm our business and operating results 

we may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines costs and production ramps at new factories or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there 

our ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories the construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements procurement and maintenance of construction environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion potential supply chain constraints hiring training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture highquality units at scale for example we are currently constructing gigafactory berlin under conditional permits in anticipation of being granted final permits moreover we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory we have limited experience to date with developing and implementing manufacturing innovations outside of the fremont factory and gigafactory shanghai in particular the majority of our design and engineering resources are currently located in california in order to meet our expectations for our new factories we must expand and manage localized design and engineering talent and resources if we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines costs capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be harmed 

we will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells including through the development and manufacture of our own cells and control our related costs 

we are dependent on the continued supply of lithiumion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans currently we rely on suppliers such as panasonic and contemporary amperex technology co limited catl for these cells we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number 

  

of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products in the long term we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us which we believe will be more efficient manufacturable at greater volumes and more costeffective than currently available cells however our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required and may continue to require significant investments and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all if we are unable to do so we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs either of which may harm our business and operating results 

in addition the cost of battery cells whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium nickel cobalt andor other metals the prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices moreover any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand prospects and operating results 

we face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors 

the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future for example model 3 and model y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan and compact suv markets a significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms in some cases our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as china and europe andor have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future many of our competitors have significantly greater or betterestablished resources than we do to devote to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers developers installers and service providers of competing energy technologies as well as from large utilities decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and ppas 

  

risks related to our operations 

we may experience issues with lithiumion cells or other components manufactured at gigafactory nevada and gigafactory shanghai which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products 

our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithiumion battery cell production including by our partner panasonic at gigafactory nevada in addition we produce several vehicle components such as battery modules and packs and drive units at gigafactory nevada and gigafactory shanghai and we also manufacture energy storage products at gigafactory nevada in the past some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines if we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at gigafactory nevada and gigafactory shanghai production or if we are unable to do so costeffectively or hire and retain highlyskilled personnel there our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited which may harm our business and operating results 

finally the high volumes of lithiumion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at gigafactory nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business 

we face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory political economic tax and labor conditions 

we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements political uncertainty and social environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions including markets in which we generate significant sales over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable our operations in such jurisdictions particularly as a company based in the us create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures organizing local operating entities establishing staffing and managing foreign business locations attracting local customers navigating foreign 

  

government taxes regulations and permit requirements enforceability of our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products such conditions may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively 

our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional 

if our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as new autopilot or fsd features take longer than expected to become enabled are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation our ability to develop market and sell our products and services may be harmed and we may experience delivery delays product recalls product liability breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses for example we are developing selfdriving and driver assist technologies to rely on visionbased sensors unlike alternative technologies in development that additionally require other redundant sensors there is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as expected in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

our products are also highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks issues experienced by our customers have included those related to the model s and model x 17inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12volt battery in the model s the seats and doors in the model x and the operation of solar panels installed by us although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers while we have performed extensive internal testing on our products and features we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers 

we may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims 

the automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected as is true for other automakers our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury and such accidents where autopilot or fsd features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of such new technologies that we are pioneering in addition the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells while we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur in particular due to a highspeed crash likewise as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages product recalls or redesign efforts and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and timeconsuming in most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance 

we will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our longterm business prospects in order to succeed 

in order to maintain and grow our business we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers suppliers analysts investors ratings agencies and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors customer unfamiliarity with our products any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operations to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations and other factors including those over which we have no control in particular tesla’s products business results of operations statements and actions are wellpublicized by a range of third parties such attention includes frequent criticism which is often exaggerated or unfounded such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team any such negative perceptions whether caused by us or not may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed 

we may be unable to effectively grow or manage the compliance residual value financing and credit risks related to our various financing programs 

we offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in north america europe and asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions we also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets depending on the country such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us 

  

under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease we have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties 

the profitability of any directlyleased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles we have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program the funding and growth of this program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds partners or other financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries furthermore if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk 

similarly we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined amounts however actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above if the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the predetermined amounts we have offered our financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

finally our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk in the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all if a significant number of our customers default we may incur substantial credit losses andor impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets 

we must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory new york 

we are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the suny foundation these agreements provide for the construction and use of our gigafactory new york which we have primarily used for the development and production of our solar roof and other solar products and components energy storage components and supercharger components and for other lessorapproved functions under this agreement we are obligated to among other things meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the state of new york and in buffalo new york and spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during a period that was initially 10 years beginning april 30 2018 as we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at gigafactory new york pursuant to a new york state executive order issued in march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we were granted a deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets through december 31 2021 in an amendment memorialized in august 2021 as of december 31 2021 we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the state of new york and buffalo while we expect to have and grow significant operations at gigafactory new york and the surrounding buffalo area any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program payment” of 41 million to the suny foundation for such year the termination of our lease at gigafactory new york which may require us to pay additional penalties andor the need to adjust certain of our operations in particular our production ramp of the solar roof or other components any of the foregoing events may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to attract hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel our ability to compete may be harmed 

the loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development introduction and ramp of our products and services in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk technoking of tesla and our chief executive officer none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success also depends upon our ability to attract hire and retain a large number of engineering manufacturing marketing sales and delivery service installation technology and support personnel especially to support our planned highvolume product sales market and geographical expansion and technological innovations recruiting efforts particularly for senior employees may be timeconsuming which may delay the execution of our plans if we are not successful in managing these risks our business financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

employees may leave tesla or choose other employers over tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to us in regions where we 

  

have or will have operations particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles engineering and electrical and building construction expertise moreover we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reasons likewise as a result of our temporary suspension of various us manufacturing operations in the first half of 2020 in april 2020 we temporarily furloughed certain hourly employees and reduced most salaried employees’ base salaries we also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities 

finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins with an emphasis on equitybased awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the longterm interests of our stockholders we periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans if we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk technoking of tesla and our chief executive officer 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk technoking of tesla and our chief executive officer although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies corp a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures 

our information technology systems or data or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyberattacks or other security incidents which could result in data breaches intellectual property theft claims litigation regulatory investigations significant liability reputational damage and other adverse consequences 

we continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow such as product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems this includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the us and abroad while we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft data breaches sabotage and other external or internal cyberattacks or misappropriation our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware ransomware viruses denialofservice attacks phishing attacks social engineering computer hacking unauthorized access exploitation of bugs defects and vulnerabilities breakdowns damage interruptions system malfunctions power outages terrorism acts of vandalism security breaches security incidents inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties and other cyberattacks 

to the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition use corruption loss destruction alteration or dissemination of our data including intellectual property and personal information or our products or vehicles or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred it could disrupt our business harm our reputation compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws subject us to time consuming distracting and expensive litigation regulatory investigation and oversight mandatory corrective action require us to verify the correctness of database contents or otherwise subject us to liability under laws regulations and contractual obligations including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information this could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure andor reputational harm 

we also rely on service providers and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business there have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks our service providers including our workforce management software provider have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident or other disruption to our or our service providers’ systems our ability to monitor our service providers’ security measures is limited and in any event malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures 

further the implementation maintenance segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost and there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems including disruptions to the related areas of business operation these risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service products adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations 

moreover if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results moreover our proprietary information 

  

including intellectual property and personal information could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products 

our products contain complex information technology systems for example our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality while we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our products and their systems malicious entities have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks products and systems to gain control of or to change our products’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products we encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability however there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful 

any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our products their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products their systems or data are capable of being hacked may harm our brand prospects and operating results we have been the subject of such reports in the past 

our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities 

it is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the us mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory from time to time labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the national labor relations board the nlrb and they may do so in the future in september 2019 an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for tesla on certain issues and against us on certain others in march 2021 the nlrb adopted a portion of the recommendation and overturned others tesla appealed the decision to the united states circuit court for the fifth circuit which is currently pending any unfavorable ultimate outcome for tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of tesla’s treatment of our employees furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results 

we may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions 

as a manufacturing company we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products recalls for our vehicles have resulted from for example industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier concerns of corrosion in certain model s and model x power steering assist motor bolts suspension failures in certain model s and model x issues with certain model s and model x media control units and torqueing of bolts to internal specifications on certain model 3 and model y misalignment of the frunk latch assembly on certain model s and unavailability of the rearview camera display on certain model 3 in addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be nonexistent in the future we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as us federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could result in significant expense supply chain complications and service burdens and may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used tesla vehicles we sell we also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell including on their installation and maintenance for components not manufactured by us we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components as part of our energy generation and storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract under these performance guarantees we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls even if they result from failures in components 

  

from third party manufacturers these risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties 

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our financial condition and operating results may be harmed warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as model 3 model y and solar roof that we have introduced relatively recently andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future 

our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks 

we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of god and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage as a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions policy limitations and exclusions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which may harm our financial condition and operating results 

our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

the terms of certain of our credit facilities including our senior assetbased revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt in addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio as a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it 

additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them 

our business and our future plans for expansion are capitalintensive and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment 

we depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives however product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected moreover improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment alternatively as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations may be harmed 

we hold and may acquire digital assets that may be subject to volatile market prices impairment and unique risks of loss 

in january 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity allowing us to invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets gold bullion gold exchangetraded funds and other assets as specified in the future thereafter we invested certain of such cash in bitcoin and also accepted bitcoin as a form of payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions subject to applicable laws and suspended this practice in may 2021 we believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash as with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiatbased cash and cash equivalent accounts we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and on our view of market and environmental conditions 

  

the prices of digital assets have been in the past and may continue to be highly volatile including as a result of various associated risks and uncertainties for example the prevalence of such assets is a relatively recent trend and their longterm adoption by investors consumers and businesses is unpredictable moreover their lack of a physical form their reliance on technology for their creation existence and transactional validation and their decentralization may subject their integrity to the threat of malicious attacks and technological obsolescence finally the extent to which securities laws or other regulations apply or may apply in the future to such assets is unclear and may change in the future if we hold digital assets and their values decrease relative to our purchase prices our financial condition may be harmed 

moreover digital assets are currently considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules meaning that any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale which may adversely affect our operating results in any period in which such impairment occurs moreover there is no guarantee that future changes in gaap will not require us to change the way we account for digital assets held by us 

finally as intangible assets without centralized issuers or governing bodies digital assets have been and may in the future be subject to security breaches cyberattacks or other malicious activities as well as human errors or computer malfunctions that may result in the loss or destruction of private keys needed to access such assets while we intend to take all reasonable measures to secure any digital assets if such threats are realized or the measures or controls we create or implement to secure our digital assets fail it could result in a partial or total misappropriation or loss of our digital assets and our financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness 

as of december 31 2021 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 538 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note 11 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions we and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar currently primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and norwegian krone to the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies any strengthening of the us dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars as we have historically experienced in addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the chinese yuan and japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact as a result our operating results may be harmed 

we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and expensive 

our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights which could result in 

  

substantial costs negative publicity and management attention regardless of merit while we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors accordingly we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses in addition if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services in the event that we are required to take one or more such actions our brand business financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the companys esg practices may result in additional costs or risks 

companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their esg practices investor advocacy groups certain institutional investors investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on esg practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the nonfinancial impacts of their investments while our mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy if our esg practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations which continue to evolve we may incur additional costs and our brand ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed 

our operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control such as natural disasters wars or health epidemics 

we may be impacted by natural disasters wars health epidemics weather conditions the longterm effects of climate change power outages or other events outside of our control for example our fremont factory and gigafactory nevada are located in seismically active regions in northern california and nevada and our gigafactory shanghai is located in a floodprone area moreover the area in which our gigafactory texas is located experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation if major disasters such as earthquakes floods or other climaterelated events occur or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products in addition the global covid19 pandemic has impacted economic markets manufacturing operations supply chains employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world and we have been and may in the future be adversely affected as a result we may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to government laws and regulations 

demand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products 

government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the us and abroad including certain tax exemptions tax credits and rebates may be reduced eliminated or exhausted from time to time for example previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in areas including ontario canada germany hong kong denmark and california have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted which may have negatively impacted sales certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented that provide disproportionate benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to tesla any similar developments could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles and we and our customers may have to adjust to them 

in addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds however these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase sometimes without warning for example the us federal government currently offers certain tax credits for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility however these tax credits are currently scheduled to decline andor expire in 2023 and beyond likewise in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use the benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the federal energy regulatory commission any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers 

  

increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets 

finally we and our fund investors claim these us federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower and they may do so again in the future such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors 

we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products 

as we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions we are or will be subject to complex environmental manufacturing health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the us china germany and other locations abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage recycling disposal andor human exposure to hazardous materials product material inputs and postconsumer products and with respect to constructing expanding and maintaining our facilities new or changes in environmental and climate change laws regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance including remediations of any discovered issues and changes to our operations which may be significant and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines in addition as we have increased our employee headcount and operations we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny including litigation and government investigations relating to allegations such as discrimination and workplace misconduct that we will need to defend against if we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations it may harm our brand ability to attract and retain qualified employees business and financial condition we are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of our products both domestically and abroad for example in countries outside of the us we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from requirements in the us thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries this process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements 

in particular we offer in our vehicles autopilot and fsd capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation we are continuing to develop our fsd capability technology with the goal of achieving fully selfdriving capability in the future there are a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to the sale registration and operation of fully selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and their availability which could adversely affect our business 

finally as a manufacturer installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third partyowned systems if regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions which may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

any failure by us to comply with a variety of us and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us 

any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us in addition certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation application and impact and may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation for example the general data protection regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the european union and has created new compliance obligations and significantly increased fines for noncompliance similarly the california consumer privacy act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to california residents finally new privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in china notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data 

  

breach requirements if for example third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines penalties and damages and harm our brand prospects and operating results 

we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings 

we are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in note 15 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k to our knowledge no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred however we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the sec the us department of justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future moreover we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceedings 

for example on october 16 2018 the us district court for the southern district of new york entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the court on september 29 2018 in connection with the actions taken by the sec relating to mr musk’s statement on august 7 2018 that he was considering taking tesla private pursuant to the settlement we among other things paid a civil penalty of 20 million appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governancerelated matters on april 26 2019 this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previouslyagreed disclosure procedures which was subsequently approved by the court all other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us 

we may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly 

while we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies including sales through our website we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the us with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model it has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and such assertions persist in certain locations decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been and may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws we have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers in some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model a few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate the application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict 

internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intraday trading high of 124349 per share and a low of 53949 per share the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in particular a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares securities class action litigation has been filed against us while we defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

  

our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors 

we expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities may not be consistent or linear between periods additionally our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who may be focused only on shortterm quarterly financial results if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time 

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline 

we may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions if our guidance varies from actual results due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly 

transactions relating to our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiaries would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes by their holders and we may be required to deliver a significant number of shares any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market prices in addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or the anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

if elon musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations such sales could cause our stock price to decline 

certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to elon musk our chief executive officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to thirdparty participants in such offerings and placements we are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further 

antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover attempt 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and other provisions of delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations in addition the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

for a description of our material pending legal proceedings please see note 15 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

in addition each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to item 103 of regulation sk because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that we currently believe could potentially exceed 1 million we believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount 

the german umweltbundesamt has issued our subsidiary in germany a notice and fine in the amount of 12 million euro alleging its noncompliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and takeback obligations with respect to endoflife battery products required thereunder in response to tesla’s objection the german umweltbundesamt issued tesla a revised fine notice dated april 29 2021 in which it reduced the original fine amount to 145 million euro this is primarily relating to administrative requirements but tesla has continued to take back battery packs and although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter including the final amount of any penalties we filed a new objection in june 2021 and it is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business 

in april 2021 we received a notice from the environmental protection agency the “epa” alleging that tesla failed to provide records demonstrating compliance with certain requirements under the applicable national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants under the clean air act of 1963 as amended relating to surface coating of automobiles and lightduty trucks regulations tesla has responded to all information requests from the epa and refutes the allegations tesla continues to cooperate with the epa in resolving this matter and it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business 

district attorneys in certain california counties are conducting an investigation into teslas waste segregation practices pursuant to cal health  saf code section 25100 et seq and cal civil code § 179880 tesla has implemented various remedial measures including conducting training and audits and enhancements to its site waste management programs while the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business

in 2021 we recognized total revenues of 5382 billion representing a 71 increase compared to the prior year we continue to ramp production build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth 

in 2021 our net income attributable to common stockholders was 552 billion representing a favorable change of 480 billion compared to the prior year we continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies 

we ended 2021 with 1758 billion in cash and cash equivalents representing a decrease of 181 billion from the end of 2020 our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2021 was 1150 billion representing an increase of 555 billion compared to 594 billion during 2020 and capital expenditures amounted to 648 billion during 2021 compared to 316 billion during 2020 sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself but we will continue investing in a number of capitalintensive projects in upcoming periods 

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2022 outlook 

impact of covid19 pandemic 

  

beginning in the first quarter of 2021 there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against covid19 as well as an easing of restrictions on social business travel and government activities and functions on the other hand infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic including challenges and increases in costs for logistics and supply chains such as increased port congestion intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor supply we have also previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments 

  

ultimately we cannot predict the duration of the covid19 pandemic we will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly 

  

automotive—production 

the following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development as of the date of this annual report on form 10k 

  

   

we are focused on ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing capacity at our current factories our current production continues to be affected by the industrywide semiconductor and other component shortages requiring additional workaround manufacturing and production design solutions to be implemented which may be difficult to sustain builds of model y in gigafactory texas and equipment testing through the vehicle production process in gigafactory berlin started in late 2021 the next phase of production growth will depend on the testing and ramp at gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have highvolume output lower capital and production costs and longer range consistent with our approach of innovating manufacturing techniques at our new factories we expect as well to pioneer new methods related to the mass production of these cells and our unique structural battery pack concept our goals are to improve vehicle performance decrease production costs and increase affordability 

however these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects any industrywide component constraints which may increase the number of manufacturing and production design workaround solutions required labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the covid19 pandemic moreover we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory 

automotive—demand and sales 

our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability and for example have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in china in addition to ramping production in 2022 we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality including through products based on artificial intelligence such as autopilot and fsd and other software features moreover we expect to continue to benefit from a spike in demand in the automotive industry generally as well as ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness 

however we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade environmental and political uncertainty all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the covid19 pandemic moreover as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation we will have to continue to execute well to maintain our momentum 

automotive—deliveries and customer infrastructure 

  

as our deliveries increase we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at gigafactory shanghai has been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the united states and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets as we expand our manufacturing operations globally we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction in particular we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations 

  

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment 

  

the longterm success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes we continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand including beginning construction of our megafactory in lathrop california but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints for megapack energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones for powerwall better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products we remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a lowcost and simplified online ordering experience in addition we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for solar roof by onboarding and training new installers as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs as these product lines grow we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel particularly skilled electricians to support the ramp of solar roof 

cash flow and capital expenditure trends 

our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions we are simultaneously ramping new products in the new model s and model x megapack and solar roof ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects the pace at which we meet milestones production adjustments to and among our various products increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between 500 to 700 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years 

our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation on the other hand we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capitalintensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the covid19 pandemic moreover as our stock price has significantly increased we have seen higher levels of early conversions of “inthemoney” convertible senior notes which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes overall we expect our ability to be selffunding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales 

operating expense trends 

as long as we see expanding sales and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation we expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally 

in the first quarter of 2021 we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin we believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash as with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiatbased cash and cashequivalent accounts we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions digital assets are considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules accordingly any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale for any digital assets held now or in the future these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase for example in the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded approximately 101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of 128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected 

  

due to the covid19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets the estimates used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements sales return reserves the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets goodwill fair value of financial instruments fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted we have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10k these estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

automotive sales without resale value guarantee 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under asc 606 including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates we recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business other features and services such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle revenue related to fsd features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available 

at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue 

costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates as our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts 

automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value 

we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with asc 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise the performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values 

  

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff 

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material writedowns may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period 

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

income taxes 

we are subject to taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2021 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

  

  

results of operations 

  

revenues 

  

   

automotive  services and other segment 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new model s model x model 3 and model y vehicles including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting 

automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production sales and pricing negotiated with our customers we monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits 

automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting additionally automotive leasing revenue includes direct salestype leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer 

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue 

2021 compared to 2020 

automotive sales revenue increased 1952 billion or 79 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase of 433815 model 3 and model y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of model y sales offset by regional sales mix additionally we had a 365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees which increased our automotive sales revenue due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 the increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28819 model s and model x cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of model s and model x only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021 respectively 

automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased 115 million or 7 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions 

automotive leasing revenue increased 590 million or 56 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct salestype leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020  these increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined 

services and other revenue increased 150 billion or 65 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue 

energy generation and storage segment 

energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives 

  

2021 compared to 2020 

energy generation and storage revenue increased by 795 million or 40 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in deployments of megapack solar cash and loan jobs powerwall and solar roof partially offset by a decrease in powerpack deployments as we phase out the product following the introduction of megapack  

cost of revenues and gross margin 

  

   

automotive  services and other segment 

cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand 

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles cost of goods sold associated with direct salestype leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs 

cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers 

2021 compared to 2020 

cost of automotive sales revenue increased 1272 billion or 65 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase of 433815 model 3 and model y cash deliveries additionally the net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees resulted in a corresponding increase of 286 million in cost of automotive sales revenue these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 28819 model s and model x cash deliveries at higher costs per unit due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes during our current production ramp of the new versions of model s and model x additionally there was a decrease in combined average model 3 and model y costs per unit due to changes in regional production mix as gigafactory shanghai has ramped in capacity where costs are lower from localized procurement and manufacturing in china 

  

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 415 million or 74 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct salestype leasing cost of revenues from more sales in the current year these increases were partially offset by the decrease in cost of automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined 

cost of services and other revenue increased 124 billion or 46 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of nontesla used vehicles costs to support our increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue and costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased 

gross margin for total automotive increased from 256 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 293 in the year ended december 31 2021 the increase was primarily due to favorable changes in sales and production mix of model 3 and model y as gigafactory shanghai has ramped in capacity the average model 3 and model y costs per unit have decreased significantly due to localized procurement and manufacturing in china despite rising raw material commodity logistics and expedite costs additionally our model y gross margin has benefitted from shared manufacturing of model 3 and learnings from the scaling of past products these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 115 million in sales of regulatory credits which have negligible incremental costs associated with them 

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment increased from 224 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 269 in the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and an improvement in our services and other gross margin additionally there was a lower proportion of services and other which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business within the segment in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year 

energy generation and storage segment 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand in agreements for solar energy system and ppas where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 

2021 compared to 2020 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 942 million or 48 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to increases in deployments of solar roof solar cash and loan jobs megapack and powerwall partially offset by reductions in average costs per unit of solar roof as deployments have increased and a decrease in powerpack deployments as we phase out the product following the introduction of megapack 

gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 09 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 46 in the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to a higher proportion of solar roof in our overall energy business which operated at a lower gross margin as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp despite an improvement in gross margin compared to the prior year and lower powerpack gross margin as fixed cost absorptions are negatively impacted as we phase out the product following the introduction of megapack these decreases were partially offset by a higher proportion of powerwall in our overall energy business which operated at a higher gross margin as well as an increase in megapack gross margin as we continue to scale the products 

research and development expense 

  

   

research and development “rd” expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense 

  

rd expenses increased 110 billion or 74 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily due to a 506 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to an increase in headcount a 263 million increase in rd expensed materials a 211 million increase in facilities outside services freight and depreciation expense and an 103 million increase in stockbased compensation expense these increases were to support our expanding product roadmap such as the new versions of model s and model x and technologies including our proprietary battery cells and there were additional rd expenses as we were in the preproduction phases at both gigafactory texas and gigafactory berlin in the current year 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 5 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 rd expenses increased proportionately with the increase in total revenues from expanding sales 

selling general and administrative expense 

  

   

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements 

sga expenses increased 137 billion or 44 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase is primarily due to an increase of 568 million in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount and increased payroll taxes due to our higher average share price in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year additionally there was 340 million of additional payroll tax due to our ceos option exercises from the 2012 ceo performance award a 319 million increase in office information technology facilitiesrelated expenses sales and marketing activities and other costs and an increase of 145 million in stockbased compensation expense of which 72 million was attributable to the 2018 ceo performance award see note 13 equity incentive plans  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

sga expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 10 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 8 in the year ended december 31 2021 our sga expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues due to operational efficiencies 

restructuring and other expense 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded 101 million of impairment losses on bitcoin we also realized gains of 128 million in connection with selling a portion of our holdings in march 2021 see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 3 digital assets net  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense decreased by 377 million or 50 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to a reduction of 173 million as a result of the adoption of asu 202006 accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity on january 1 2021 whereby we have derecognized the remaining debt discounts on the 2022 notes and 2024 notes and therefore no longer recognize any amortization of debt discounts as interest expense as well as the continued reduction in our overall debt balance see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

  

other income expense net 

  

   

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates 

other income expense net changed favorably by 257 million in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a 49 million favorable change in the marktomarket remeasurement of our interest rate swaps 

provision for income taxes 

  

   

our provision for income taxes increased by 407 million or 139 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to the increases in taxable profits within our foreign jurisdictions year over year 

our effective tax rate decreased from 25 to 11 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to growth in pretax income and changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings 

see note 14 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 

  

   

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased by 16 million or 11 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years the cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the fremont factory gigafactory nevada gigafactory shanghai and gigafactory new york the construction and ramp of gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities 

in addition because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment for example if our nearterm manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected including due to global economic or business conditions we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures finally we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds conversely we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early 

accordingly we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12month period following december 31 2021 as well as in the longterm 

  

see the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs 

material cash requirements 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products however due to contractual terms variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps and opportunities to renegotiate pricing we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short term and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project 

as discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—management opportunities challenges and risks and 2022 outlook—cash flow and capital expenditure trends in this annual report on form 10k we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between 500 to 700 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years in connection with our operations at gigafactory new york we have an agreement to spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york through december 31 2029 pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in april 2021 and which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the suny foundation in august 2021 we also have an operating lease arrangement with the local government of shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend rmb 1408 billion in capital expenditures at gigafactory shanghai by the end of 2023 for details regarding these obligations refer to note 15 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2021 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 538 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of which 109 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months as of december 31 2021 our total minimum lease payments are 403 billion of which 104 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months for details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations refer to note 11 debt  and note 12 leases to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

sources and conditions of liquidity 

our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings when applicable 

as of december 31 2021 we had 1758 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 722 billion and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euros and canadian dollars in addition we had 111 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of december 31 2021 certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or various other assets for details regarding our indebtedness refer to note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we continue adapting our investment strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives such as investing in us government and other marketable securities digital assets and providing product related financing in the first quarter of 2021 we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin the fair market value of our bitcoin holdings as of december 31 2021 was 199 billion we believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash as with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiatbased cash and cash equivalent accounts we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions however digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices which may be unfavorable at the times when we may want or need to liquidate them additionally we held shortterm marketable securities of 131 million as of december 31 2021 

  

summary of cash flows 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities 

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing customer lease payments customer deposits cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process operating expenses operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 555 billion to 1150 billion during the year ended december 31 2021 from 594 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 this increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of 522 billion and the overall decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 334 million the decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory the decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by larger increases of inventory and operating lease vehicles compared to the prior year 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 648 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 and 316 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 mainly for the construction of gigafactory texas and gigafactory berlin and the expansions of gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory additionally net cash outflows related to digital assets were 123 billion in the year ended december 31 2021 from purchases of digital assets for 150 billion offset by proceeds from sales of digital assets of 272 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash outflows from financing activities were 520 billion during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 997 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31 2020 the change was primarily due to no equity offerings in 2021 compared to 1227 billion of proceeds from issuances of common stock net of issuance costs in 2020 a 337 billion increase in net repayments of convertible and other debt compared to the prior year offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances of 290 million and a decrease in collateralized lease repayments of 231 million compared to the prior year see note 11 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding our debt obligations

 item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

we transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and norwegian krone in relation to our current year operations in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar for our foreign subsidiaries accordingly changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk 

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances 

  

we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm these changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes these changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of 277 million at december 31 2021 and 8 million at december 31 2020 assuming no foreign currency hedging 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates on our floating rate debt would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 by 2 million and 4 million respectively

while the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage 

for example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energyrelated us federal tax credits described below the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets in addition california and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behindthemeter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program

solar energy system incentives and policies

us federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates

in particular sections 48 and 25d of the us internal revenue code currently provide a tax credit of 26 of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems these tax credits are currently scheduled to decline andor expire in 2023 and beyond 

regulations

vehicle safety and testing

in the us our vehicles are subject to regulation by the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” including all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards “fmvss” and the nhtsa bumper standard numerous fmvss apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements while our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable fmvss with limited or no exemptions fmvss are subject to change from time to time as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable fmvss and the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the us 

we are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by nhtsa including the cafe standards theft prevention act requirements consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls owner’s manual requirements and additional requirements for cooperating with safety investigations and defect and recall reporting the us automobile information and disclosure act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings as determined by the us department of transportation and the environmental protection agency the “epa” and 5star safety ratings as determined by nhtsa if available 

 

our vehicles sold outside of the us are subject to similar foreign safety environmental and other regulations many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the us and may require redesign andor retesting  some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features additionally t he european union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commence d in 2020 and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union 

selfdriving vehicles

generally laws pertaining to selfdriving vehicles are evolving globally and in some cases may create restrictions on selfdriving features that we develop while there are currently no federal us regulations specifically pertaining to selfdriving vehicles or selfdriving equipment nhtsa has published recommended guidelines on selfdriving vehicles and retains the authority to investigate andor take action on the safety of any vehicle equipment or features operating on public roads certain us states have legal restrictions on the operation registration or licensure of selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them this regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to selfdriving vehicles in the us 

in markets that follow the regulations of the united nations economic commission for europe some requirements restrict the design of advanced driverassistance or selfdriving features which can compromise or prevent their use entirely other applicable laws both current and proposed may hinder the path and timeline to introducing selfdriving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply 

other key markets including china continue to consider selfdriving regulation any implemented regulations may differ materially from those in the us and europe which may further increase the legal complexity of selfdriving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation

in the us state laws regulate the manufacture distribution sale and service of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the transfer of title out of the state in certain such states we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur

some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations we expect such challenges to continue and we intend to actively fight any such efforts

battery safety and testing

our battery packs are subject to various us and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation we conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations

we use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products the use storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future we have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs and we are also piloting our own recycling technology 

solar energy—general

we are not a “regulated utility” in the us although we are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers to operate our systems we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases ppas and subscription agreements have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions

solar energy—net metering

most states in the us make net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so

 

competition 

automotive

the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader crosssection of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles’ capabilities

we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology for example model s and model x compete primarily with premium sedans and premium suvs and model 3 and model y compete with small to mediumsized sedans and compact suvs which are extremely competitive markets competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers however many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the us china and europe and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles in addition several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles including plugin versions 

we also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering selfdriving technologies charging solutions and other features and services and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our autopilot fsd and neural network capabilities supercharger network and our infotainment offerings

energy generation and storage

energy storage systems

the market for energy storage products is also highly competitive and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems we compete with these companies based on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specifications and features of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets

solar energy systems

the primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers we compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems we also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations we believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems

intellectual property 

we place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio as part of our business we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other measures including through employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements for example we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio we have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world

human capital resources 

as of december 31 2020 our fulltime count for our and our subsidiaries’ employees worldwide was 70757 to date we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values

 

we want to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees our efforts begin at the entry level with development apprenticeship and internship programs in local high schools community colleges and fouryear colleges  in addition we seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree and have provided thousands of job openings  including in our local communities for capable workers from various backgrounds to learn valuable skills in critical operations such as in manufacturing vehicle service and energy product installation  we also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development our goal is a longterm upwardbound career at tesla for every employee  which we believe also drives our retention efforts  

we also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe respectful fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business from our outreach to historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions to sponsoring employee resource groups across numerous locations including asian pacific islanders at tesla black at tesla intersectionality latinos at tesla lgbtq at tesla veterans at tesla and women in tesla we engage these networks as key business resources and sources of actionable feedback we are also working on diversity efforts in our supply chain to expand our outreach and support to small and largescale suppliers from underrepresented communities to emphasize this culture with our own employees

 item 1a risk factors

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our ability to grow our business

we may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global covid19 pandemic

since the first quarter of 2020 there has been a worldwide impact from the covid19 pandemic government regulations and shifting social behaviors have limited or closed nonessential transportation government functions business activities and persontoperson interactions in some cases the relaxation of such trends has recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce including in parts of the us and a number of areas in europe 

we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of 2020 some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming including panasonic which manufactures battery cells for our products at our gigafactory nevada we also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our us operations were scaled back reduced operations or closures at motor vehicle departments vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors have resulted in challenges in or postponements for our new vehicle deliveries used vehicle sales and energy product deployments global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact us and our industries for example pandemicrelated issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts similarly increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted sustaining our production trajectory will require the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors a stable and motivated production workforce and ongoing government cooperation including for travel and visa allowances the contingencies inherent in the construction of and ramp at new facilities such as gigafactory shanghai gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas may be exacerbated by these challenges

we cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends the sustained impact of which is largely unknown is rapidly evolving and has varied across geographic regions ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly if current global market conditions continue or worsen or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again our business prospects financial condition and operating results may be harmed

we may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs

we have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features for example we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the ramp of model x and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial model 3 manufacturing processes in addition we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features 

in particular our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of massmarket vehicles including model 3 and model y which we are planning to achieve through multiple factories worldwide we have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing model 3 and model y at high volumes and even less experience building and ramping vehicle production lines across multiple factories in different geographies in order to be successful we will need to implement maintain and ramp efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in california nevada texas china and germany we will also need to hire train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs if we are not successful in achieving these goals we could face delays in establishing andor sustaining our model 3 and model y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets 

we may also experience similar future delays in launching andor ramping production of our energy storage products and solar roof new product versions or variants new vehicles such as tesla semi cybertruck and the new tesla roadster and future features and services such as new autopilot or fsd features and the autonomous tesla ridehailing network likewise we may encounter delays with the design construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products 

 

any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future products features and services or in doing so costeffectively and with high quality may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to grow our global product sales delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth

our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities  we also frequently adjust our retail operations and product offerings in order to optimize our reach costs product lineup and model differentiation and customer experience however there is no guarantee that such steps will be accepted by consumers accustomed to traditional sales strategies for example marketing methods such as touchless test drives that we have pioneered in certain markets have not been proven at scale we are targeting with model 3 and model y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products we currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region likewise as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets 

because we do not have independent dealer networks we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers while we have improved our delivery logistics we may face difficulties with deliveries at increasing volumes particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times for example we saw challenges in ramping our logistics channels in china and europe to initially deliver model 3 there in the first quarter of 2019 we have deployed a number of delivery models such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally likewise as we ramp solar roof we are working to substantially increase installation personnel and decrease installation times if we are not successful in matching such capabilities with actual production or if we experience unforeseen production delays or inaccurately forecast demand for the solar roof our business financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

moreover because of our unique expertise with our vehicles we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals if we experience delays in adding such servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles particularly highervolume and newer additions to our fleet such as model 3 and model y it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory similarly the increasing number of tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world 

there is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales delivery installation servicing and vehicle charging targets globally that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations these plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them as we expand w e will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale installation and servicing of our products the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of superchargers if we fail to manage our growth effectively it may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive cyclical and volatile 

if the market for electric vehicles in general and tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other our business prospects financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

we are still at an earlier stage and have limited resources and production relative to established competitors that offer internal combustion engine vehicles in addition electric vehicles still comprise a small percentage of overall vehicle sales as a result the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors such as 









 





finally the target demographics for our vehicles particularly model 3 and model y are highly competitive sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to further volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies moreover the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact the transportation and automotive industries longterm it is uncertain as to how such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a company that has been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales

our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules prices quality and volumes that are acceptable to us or we may be unable to manage these components effectively

our products contain thousands of parts that we purchase globally from hundreds of mostly singlesource direct suppliers generally without longterm supply agreements this exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages such as those that we experienced in 2012 and 2016 with our model s and model x ramps unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars governmental changes tariffs natural disasters such as the march 2011 earthquakes in japan health epidemics such as the global covid19 pandemic trade and shipping disruptions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational for example a global shortage of microchips has been reported since early 2021 and the impact to us is yet unknown the unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays idle manufacturing facilities product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products moreover significant increases in our production such as for model 3 and model y or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time our suppliers may not be willing or able to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost quality and volume needs or to do so may cost us more which may require us to replace them with other sources finally we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the fremont factory and we may experience issues increasing the level of localized procurement at our gigafactory shanghai and at future factories such as gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all additionally we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce any of these occurrences may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

as the scale of our vehicle production increases we will also need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which may harm our business and operating results

we may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines costs and production ramps at new factories or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there 

our ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of gigafactory shanghai gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas the construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements procurement and maintenance of construction environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion potential supply chain constraints hiring training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture highquality units at scale for example we are currently constructing gigafactory berlin under conditional permits moreover we intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory we have limited experience to date with developing and implementing vehicle manufacturing innovations outside of the fremont factory as we only recently began production at gigafactory shanghai in particular the majority of our design and engineering resources are currently located in california in order to meet our expectations for our new factories we must expand and manage localized design and engineering talent and resources if we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines costs capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be harmed 

 

we will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells including through the development and manufacture of our own cells and control our related costs 

we are dependent on the continued supply of lithiumion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans currently we rely on suppliers such as panasonic for these cells however we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products in the long term we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us which we believe will be more efficient manufacturable at greater volumes and costeffective than currently available cells however our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required and may require significant investments and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all if we are unable to do so we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs either of which may harm our business and operating results 

in addition the cost of battery cells whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium nickel cobalt andor other metals the prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices moreover any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand prospects and operating results

we face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors 

the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future for example model 3 and model y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan and compact suv markets a significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms in some cases our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as china and europe andor have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future many of our competitors have significantly greater or betterestablished resources than we do to devote to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which may harm our business financial condition and operating results

we also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers developers installers and service providers of competing energy systems as well as from large utilities decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and ppas 

 

risks related to our operations

we may experience issues with lithiumion cells or other components manufactured at gigafactory nevada which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products

our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithiumion battery cell production by our partner panasonic at gigafactory nevada although panasonic has a long track record of producing highquality cells at significant volume at its factories in japan it has relatively limited experience with cell production at gigafactory nevada  which began in 2017 moreover although panasonic is colocated with us at gigafactory nevada it is free to make its own operational decisions such as its determination to temporarily suspend its manufacturing there in response to the covid19 pandemic in addition we produce several vehicle components such as battery modules and packs incorporating the cells produced by panasonic for model 3 and model y and drive units including to support gigafactory shanghai production at gigafactory nevada and we also manufacture energy storage products there in the past some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines if we or panasonic are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at gigafactory nevada production or if we are unable to do so costeffectively or hire and retain highlyskilled personnel there our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited which may harm our business and operating results

finally the high volumes of lithiumion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at gigafactory nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities while 

 

we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations  any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business 

we face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory political economic tax and labor conditions

we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements political uncertainty and social environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable our operations in such jurisdictions particularly as a company based in the us create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures organizing local operating entities establishing staffing and managing foreign business locations attracting local customers navigating foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements enforceability of our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products such conditions may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention and may harm our business if we unable to manage them effectively

our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional

if our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as new autopilot or fsd features take longer than expected to become enabled are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation our ability to develop market and sell our products and services may be harmed and we may experience delivery delays product recalls product liability breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses  in particular our products are highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks issues experienced by our customers have included those related to the model s and model x 17inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12volt battery in the model s the seats and doors in the model x and the operation of solar panels installed by us although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers while we have performed extensive internal testing on our products and features we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers

we may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims

the automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected as is true for other automakers our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury and such accidents where autopilot or fsd features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of such new technologies that we are pioneering in addition the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells while we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur in particular due to a highspeed crash likewise as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages product recalls or redesign efforts and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and timeconsuming in most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance

we will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our longterm business prospects in order to succeed

in order to maintain and grow our business we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers suppliers analysts investors ratings agencies and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors customer unfamiliarity with our products any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operations to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations and other factors including those over which we have no control in particular tesla’s products business results of operations statements and actions are wellpublicized by a range of third parties such attention includes frequent criticism which is often exaggerated or unfounded such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team any such negative perceptions whether caused by us or not may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed

 

we may be unable to effectively grow or manage the compliance residual value financing and credit risks related to our various financing programs 

we offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets depending on the country such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease we have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties

the profitability of any directlyleased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles we have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program the funding and growth of this program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds partners or other financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries furthermore if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk

similarly we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined amounts however actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above if the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the predetermined amounts we have offered our financial condition and operating results may be harmed

finally our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk in the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all if a significant number of our customers default we may incur substantial credit losses andor impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets

we must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory new york

we are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the suny foundation these agreements provide for the construction and use of our gigafactory new york which we have primarily used for the development and production of our solar roof and other solar products and components energy storage components and supercharger components and for other lessorapproved functions under this agreement we are obligated to among other things meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the state of new york and in buffalo new york and spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period beginning april 30 2018 as we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at gigafactory new york pursuant to a new york state executive order issued in march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we were granted a oneyear deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets under such agreement on april 30 2020 which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the suny foundation in july 2020 while we expect to have and grow significant operations at gigafactory new york and the surrounding buffalo area any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program payment” of 41 million to the suny foundation for such year the termination of our lease at gigafactory new york which may require us to pay additional penalties andor the need to adjust certain of our operations in particular our production ramp of the solar roof or other components any of the foregoing events may harm our business financial condition and operating results

if we are unable to attract hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel our ability to compete may be harmed

the loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development introduction and ramp of our products and services in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success also depends upon our ability to attract hire and retain a large number of engineering manufacturing marketing sales and delivery service installation technology and support personnel especially to support our planned highvolume product sales market and geographical 

 

expansion and technological innovation s  recruiting efforts particularly for senior employees may be timeconsuming which may delay the execution of our plans if we are not successful in managing these risks our business financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

employees may leave tesla or choose other employers over tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to us in california nevada and other regions where we have operations there is increasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineering manufacturing engineering and electrical and building construction expertise moreover we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reasons likewise as a result of our temporary suspension of various us manufacturing operations in the first half of 2020 in april 2020 we temporarily furloughed certain hourly employees and reduced most salaried employees’ base salaries we also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities 

finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins with an emphasis on equitybased awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the longterm interests of our stockholders we periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans if we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies corp a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures

we must manage risks relating to our information technology systems and the threat of intellectual property theft data breaches and cyberattacks 

we must continue to expand and improve our information technology systems as our operations grow such as product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems this includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the us and abroad we must also continue to maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft data breaches sabotage and other external or internal cyberattacks or misappropriation however the implementation maintenance segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost and there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems including disruptions to the related areas of business operation these risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service products adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations 

moreover if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results moreover our proprietary information or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions

any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products

our products contain complex information technology systems for example our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality while we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our products and their systems malicious entities have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks products and systems to gain control of or to change our products’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products we encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability however there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful

 

any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations  in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our products their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products their systems or data are capable of being hacked may harm our brand prospects and operating results we have been the subject of such reports in the past 

our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities 

it is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the us mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory from time to time labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the national labor relations board and they may do so in the future in september 2019 an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for tesla on certain issues and against us on certain others the national labor relations board has not yet adopted the recommendation and we have appealed certain aspects of the recommended decision any unfavorable ultimate outcome for tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of tesla’s treatment of our employees furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results

we may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions 

as a manufacturing company we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products recalls for our vehicles have resulted from for example industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier concerns of corrosion in model s and model x power steering assist motor bolts certain suspension failures in model s and model x and issues with model s and model x media control units in addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be nonexistent in the future we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as us federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could result in significant expense supply chain complications and service burdens and may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used tesla vehicles we sell we also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell including on their installation and maintenance and for components not manufactured by us we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties as part of our energy generation and storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract under these performance guarantees we bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls even if they result from failures in components from third party manufacturers these risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our financial condition and operating results may be harmed warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as model 3 model y and solar roof that we have recently introduced andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future

our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks

we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of god and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage as a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions policy limitations and exclusions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which may harm our financial condition and operating results

 

there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness 

as of december 31 2020 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 1057 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions we and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt 

holders of convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiary may convert such notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective convertible senior notes under certain circumstances pursuant to the terms of such notes upon conversion of the applicable convertible senior notes we will be obligated to deliver cash andor shares pursuant to the terms of such notes for example as our stock price has significantly increased recently we have seen higher levels of early conversions of such “inthemoney” convertible senior notes moreover holders of such convertible senior notes may have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change pursuant to the terms of such notes

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results

our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

the terms of certain of our credit facilities including our senior assetbased revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt in addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio as a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it

additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them

our business and our future plans for expansion are capitalintensive and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected

we may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment

we depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives however product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected moreover improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment alternatively as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations may be harmed

 

we hold and may acquire digital assets that may be subject to volatile market prices impairmen t and unique risks of loss 

 

in january 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity as part of the policy which was duly approved by the audit committee of our board of directors we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets gold bullion gold exchangetraded funds and other assets as specified in the future thereafter we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or longterm moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt

 

the prices of digital assets have been in the past and may continue to be highly volatile including as a result of various associated risks and uncertainties for example the prevalence of such assets is a relatively recent trend and their longterm adoption by investors consumers and businesses is unpredictable moreover their lack of a physical form their reliance on technology for their creation existence and transactional validation and their decentralization may subject their integrity to the threat of malicious attacks and technological obsolescence finally the extent to which securities laws or other regulations apply or may apply in the future to such assets is unclear and may change in the future if we hold digital assets and their values decrease relative to our purchase prices our financial condition may be harmed

 

moreover digital assets are currently considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules meaning that any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale which may adversely affect our operating results in any period in which such impairment occurs  moreover there is no guarantee that future changes in gaap will not require us to change the way we account for digital assets held by us 

 

finally as intangible assets without centralized issuers or governing bodies digital assets have been and may in the future be subject to security breaches cyberattacks or other malicious activities as well as human errors or computer malfunctions that may result in the loss or destruction of private keys needed to access such assets while we intend to take all reasonable measures to secure any digital assets if such threats are realized or the measures or controls we create or implement to secure our digital assets fail it could result in a partial or total misappropriation or loss of our digital assets and our financial condition and operating results may be harmed

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

we transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar currently primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and british pound to the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies any strengthening of the us dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars as we have historically experienced in addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the chinese yuan and japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact as a result our operating results may be harmed

we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and expensive 

our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights which could result in substantial costs negative publicity and management attention regardless of merit while we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors accordingly we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses in addition if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative 

 

branding for our products and services in the event that we are required to take one or more such actions our brand business financial condition and operating results may be harmed 

our operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control such as natural disasters wars or health epidemics

we may be impacted by natural disasters wars health epidemics or other events outside of our control for example our corporate headquarters the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada are located in seismically active regions in northern california and nevada and our gigafactory shanghai is located in a floodprone area if major disasters such as earthquakes floods or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products in addition the global covid19 pandemic has impacted economic markets manufacturing operations supply chains employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world and we have been and may in the future be adversely affected as a result we may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

risks related to government laws and regulations

demand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products

government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the us and abroad including certain tax exemptions tax credits and rebates may be reduced eliminated or exhausted from time to time for example a 7500 federal tax credit that was available in the us for the purchase of our vehicles was reduced in phases during and ultimately ended in 2019 we believe that this sequential phaseout likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into the periods preceding each reduction moreover previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in areas including ontario canada germany hong kong denmark and california have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted which may have negatively impacted sales any similar developments could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles and we and our customers may have to adjust to them

in addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds however these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase sometimes without warning for example the us federal government currently offers certain tax credits for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility however these tax credits are currently scheduled to decline andor expire in 2023 and beyond likewise in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use the benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the ferc any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for potential customers increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets 

finally we and our fund investors claim these us federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems nevertheless the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower and they may do so again in the future such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors

we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products 

as we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions we are or will be subject to complex environmental manufacturing health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the us china germany and other locations abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage recycling disposal andor human exposure to hazardous materials product material inputs and postconsumer products and with respect to constructing expanding and maintaining our facilities the costs of compliance including remediations of any discovered issues and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws may be significant and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines we are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of automobiles both domestically and abroad for example in countries outside of the us we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and 

 

emissions that are often materially different from requirements in the us thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries this process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements 

in particular we offer in our vehicles autopilot and fsd features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation we are continuing to develop our fsd technology with the goal of achieving full selfdriving capability in the future there are a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and availability which could adversely affect our business

finally as a manufacturer installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by third partyowned systems if regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which may harm our business financial condition and operating results

any failure by us to comply with a variety of us and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us 

any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws and in particular certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation and application for example in may 2018 the general data protection regulation began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the european union and has created new compliance obligations and significantly increased fines for noncompliance similarly as of january 2020 the california consumer privacy act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to california residents finally new privacy and cybersecurity laws are coming into effect in china notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if for example third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines penalties and damages and harm our brand prospects and operating results

we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings

we are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k to our knowledge no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred however we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the sec the us department of justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future moreover we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceedings

for example on october 16 2018 the us district court for the southern district of new york entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the court on september 29 2018 in connection with the actions taken by the sec relating to mr musk’s statement on august 7 2018 that he was considering taking tesla private pursuant to the settlement we among other things paid a civil penalty of 20 million appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governancerelated matters on april 26 2019 this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previouslyagreed disclosure procedures which was subsequently approved by the court all other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us

 

we may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly 

while we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies including sales through our website we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the us with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model it has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and such assertions persist in certain locations decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been and may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws we have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers in some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model a few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate the application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict

internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile

the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intraday trading high of 90040 per share and a low of 7010 per share as adjusted to give effect to the reflect the fiveforone stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in august 2020 the “stock split”  the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in particular a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares securities class action litigation has been filed against us while we defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources

our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors

we expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities may not be consistent or linear between periods additionally our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who may be focused only on shortterm quarterly financial results if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline 

we may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions if our guidance varies from actual results due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly

 

transactions relating to our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiaries would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes by their holders and we may be required to deliver a significant number of shares any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market prices in addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or the anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

moreover in connection with certain of the convertible senior notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also affect the market price of our common stock or the convertible senior notes

if elon musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations such sales could cause our stock price to decline

certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to elon musk our chief executive officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to thirdparty participants in such offerings and placements we are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further

antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover attempt

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and other provisions of delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations in addition the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

for a description of our material pending legal proceedings please see note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

in addition each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to item 103 of regulation sk because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that could potentially exceed 1 million we believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount

the bay area air quality management district “baaqmd” has issued notices of violation to us relating to air permitting and related compliance for the fremont factory but has not initiated formal proceedings we have disputed certain of these allegations and have asserted that there has been no related adverse community or environmental impact while we have not yet resolved this matter we remain in close communication with baaqmd with respect to it we do not currently expect any material adverse impact on our business

the german umweltbundesamt has issued our subsidiary in germany a notice and fine in the amount of 12 million euro alleging its noncompliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and takeback obligations with respect to endoflife battery products required thereunder this is primarily relating to administrative requirements but tesla has continued to take back battery packs and although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter including the final amount of any penalties we have filed our objection and it is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business

we have also received a followup information request from the epa under section 114a of the clean air act of 1963 as amended the “clean air act” the epa is reviewing the compliance of our fremont factory operations with applicable requirements under the clean air act and we are working with the epa in responding its requests for information while the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2018related items refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2019 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 13 2020

overview and 2020 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products we also offer maintenance installation operation financial and other services related to our products

in 2020 we produced 509737 vehicles and delivered 499647 vehicles we are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity developing and ramping our battery cell technology increasing the affordability of our vehicles expanding our global infrastructure and introducing our next vehicles

in 2020 we deployed 302 gwh of energy storage products and 205 megawatts of solar energy systems we are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products improving our solar roof installation capability and efficiency and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems

in 2020 we recognized total revenues of 3154 billion representing an increase of 696 billion compared to the prior year we continue to ramp production build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth

in 2020 our net income attributable to common stockholders was 721 million representing a favorable change of 158 billion compared to the prior year in 2020 our operating margin was 63 representing a favorable change of 66 compared to the prior year we continue to focus on operational efficiencies while we have seen an acceleration of noncash stockbased compensation expense due to a rapid increase in our market capitalization and updates to our business outlook

we ended 2020 with 1938 billion in cash and cash equivalents representing an increase of 1312 billion from the end of 2019 our cash flows from operating activities during 2020 was 594 billion compared to 241 billion during 2019 and capital expenditures amounted to 316 billion during 2020 compared to 133 billion during 2019 sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself but we will continue a number of capitalintensive projects in upcoming periods

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2021 outlook

impact of covid19 pandemic

 

there continues to be worldwide impact from the covid19 pandemic while we have been relatively successful in navigating such impact to date we have previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments there are also ongoing related risks to our business depending on the progression of the pandemic and recent trends in certain regions have indicated potential returns to limited or closed government functions business activities and persontoperson interactions global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact us and our industries for example pandemicrelated issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts similarly increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted please see the “results of operations” section of this item below and certain risk factors described in part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k particularly the first risk factor included there for more detailed descriptions of the impact and risks to our business 

we cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends from this pandemic the sustained impact of which is largely unknown is rapidly evolving and has varied across geographic regions ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly

 

automotive—production 

the following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development as of the date of this annual report on form 10k

 



 

we recently announced updated versions of model s and model x featuring a redesigned powertrain and other improvements in 2021 we are focused on ramping these models on new manufacturing equipment as well as production rates of model 3 and model y to at least the capacity that we have installed the next phase of production growth will depend on the construction of gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas each of which is progressing as planned for deliveries beginning in 2021 our goal is to continuously decrease production costs and increase the affordability of our vehicles we are continuing to develop and manufacture our own battery cells with which we are targeting highvolume output lower capital and production costs and longer range as cell supply is critical to our business coupling this strategy with cells from our suppliers will help us stay ahead of any potential constraints 

however these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the covid19 pandemic and any industrywide component constraints moreover we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory 

automotive—demand and sales

our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability and for example have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in china in addition to opening new factories in 2021 we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ functionality including autopilot fsd and software features and introducing anticipated future vehicles moreover we expect to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness

however we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade environmental and political uncertainty all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the covid19 pandemic on the other hand there have been recent signs of recovery from competitors that experienced downturns in 2020 meaning that we will have to continue to execute well to maintain the momentum that we have gained relative to an evergrowing competitive landscape

automotive—deliveries and customer infrastructure

 

as our deliveries increase we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries situating our factories closer to local markets should mitigate the strain on our deliveries in any case as we expand we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery servicing and charging infrastructure maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our supercharger locations to ensure costeffectiveness and customer satisfaction in particular we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations 

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment

 

the longterm success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes we continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand for powerwall better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher interest and crossselling with our residential solar energy products will continue to benefit both product lines we remain committed to increasing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a lowcost and simplified online ordering experience in addition we are working to improve our installation capabilities for solar roof by onboarding and training a large number of installers and reducing the installation time dramatically as these product lines grow we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel particularly skilled electricians to support the ramp of solar roof

 

cash flow and capital expenditure trends 

our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time and uncertainties in future global market conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic currently makes projections more challenging we are simultaneously ramping new products in the new model s and model x model y and solar roof constructing or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects the pace at which we meet milestones production adjustments to and among our various products increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth we currently expect our capital expenditures to be 450 to 600 billion in 2021 and each of the next two fiscal years

our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation on the other hand we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capitalintensive projects moreover as our stock price has significantly increased recently we have seen higher levels of early conversions of “inthemoney” convertible senior notes which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes overall we expect our ability to be selffunding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales we also opportunistically strengthened our liquidity further through an atthemarket offering of common stock in december 2020 with net proceeds to us of approximately 499 billion 

operating expense trends 

as long as we see expanding sales and excluding the potential impact of noncash stock compensation expense attributable to the 2018 ceo performance award and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we additionally increase operational efficiency and process automation

in march 2018 our stockholders approved a performancebased stock option award to our ceo the “2018 ceo performance award” consisting of 12 vesting tranches contingent on the achievement of specified market capitalization and operational milestones we incur noncash stockbased compensation expense for each tranche only after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance and if this happens following the grant date we record at such time a cumulative catchup expense that may be significant based on the length of time elapsed from the grant date moreover the remaining expense for that tranche is ratably recorded over the period remaining until the later of i the expected achievement of the relevant operational milestone if it has not yet been achieved and ii the expected achievement of the related market capitalization milestone if it has not yet been achieved upon vesting of a tranche all remaining associated expense is recognized immediately because the expected market capitalization achievements are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievements the achievement of the former earlier than expected may increase the magnitude of any catchup expense andor accelerate the rate at which the remaining expense is recognized during 2020 several operational milestones became probable and several tranches vested including as a result of our market capitalization increasing rapidly resulting in the recognition or acceleration of related expense earlier than anticipated and within a relatively short period of time see note 14 equity incentive plans —2018 ceo performance award to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding the stockbased compensation relating to the 2018 ceo performance award as our market capitalization is unpredictable and our financial performance improves it is possible that the earlierthanplanned recognition of such expenses will continue in the near term

in january 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity as part of the policy we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets thereafter we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin under this policy moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt digital assets are considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules accordingly any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale as we currently intend to hold these assets longterm these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected

due to the covid19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets the estimates used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements sales return reserves the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets goodwill fair value of financial instruments fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted we have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10k t hese estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition

automotive segment

automotive sales revenue 

automotive sales without resale value guarantee 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under asc 606 including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates we recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business other features and services such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle revenue related to fsd features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available

at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns based on historical experience in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue

costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates as our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value

 

with the exception of the vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option program discussed within the automotive leasing section below  we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with asc 606 as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception  the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise the performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns as we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values 

automotive regulatory credits 

we earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to zevs greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel we sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business we recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive sales revenue in the consolidated statements of operations

automotive leasing revenue 

direct vehicle operating leasing program 

we have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the us canada and in certain countries in europe qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for model s and model x leases in certain regions may opt to purchase the vehicles for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases we record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue

our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option 

we offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the us and where we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception we continued to recognize these transactions as operating leases these transactions entailed a transfer of leases which we had originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner as control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with asc 606 these transactions were accounted for as interestbearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with asc 840 leases  prior to january 1 2019 under this program cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred revenue we amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheets and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases under asc 842 and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term consequently any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue the end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months in cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue

 

direct sales t ype leasing program 

we have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as salestype leases under asc 842 in certain countries in asia and europe which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020 depending on the specific program customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term if the customer does not have a right to return the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments under the programs for which there is a right to return the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months our loan arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months we recognize all revenue and costs associated with the salestype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue respectively upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis 

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage sales 

energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers including solar subscriptionbased arrangements energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and ppas that commence after january 1 2019 which is recognized as earned based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for ppas at the contractual billing rates assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met under the practical expedient available under asc 606105518 we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business

for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance

in instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems as our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred

 

as part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract in certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur 

we record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term 

energy generation and storage leasing 

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under ppas prior to january 1 2019 we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service fees which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term 

we capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and ppas which include the referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements

inventory valuation

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results

 

warranties 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations

stockbased compensation

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized if additional operational milestones become probable stockbased compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catchup expense for the service provided since the grant date the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations

income taxes

we are subject to taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2020 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted

 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is likely that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity “vie” of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value “hlbv” method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties the third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets for certain funds there may be significant fluctuations in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as timebased milestones are reached

 

 

results of operations 

effects of covid19

the covid19 pandemic impacted our business and financial results in 2020

the temporary suspension of production at our factories during the first half of 2020 caused production limitations that together with reduced or closed government and third party partner operations in the year negatively impacted our deliveries and deployments in 2020 while we resumed operations at all of our factories worldwide our temporary suspension at our factories resulted in idle capacity charges as we still incurred fixed costs such as depreciation certain payroll related expenses and property taxes as part of our response strategy to the business disruptions and uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic we instituted cost reduction initiatives across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operations while they were scaled back in the first half of 2020 this included temporary labor cost reduction measures such as employee furloughs and compensation reductions additionally we suspended noncritical operating spend and opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements as part of various governmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial results such payroll related benefits related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle capacity charges and they marginally reduced our operating expenses the impact of the idle capacity charges incurred during the first half of 2020 were almost entirely offset by our cost savings initiatives and payroll related benefits

 

revenues

 



 

automotive  services and other segment

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new model s model x model 3 and model y vehicles including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting our revenue from regulatory credits fluctuates depending on when a contract is executed with a buyer and when the credits are delivered

automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting we began offering direct leasing for model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019 and we began offering direct leasing for model y vehicles in the third quarter of 2020 additionally automotive leasing revenue includes direct salestype leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue

 

2020 compared to 2019 

automotive sales revenue increased 623 billion or 31 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to an increase of 129268 model 3 and model y cash deliveries despite production limitations as a result of temporary suspension of production at the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada during the first half of 2020 we were able to increase deliveries year over year from production ramping at both gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory there was also an increase of 986 million from additional sales of regulatory credits to 158 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 additionally due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the year ended december 31 2019 we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales revenue of 555 million we made further pricing adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of automotive sales revenue of 72 million during the year ended december 31 2020 the smaller reduction in revenue from pricing adjustments resulted in a positive impact to automotive sales revenue of 483 million year over year these factors increasing automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in the combined average selling price of model 3 and model y despite the inclusion of higher priced model y deliveries in 2020 the combined average selling price of model 3 and model y decreased due to a higher proportion of model 3 standard range variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year additionally there was a decrease in automotive sales revenue from 8669 fewer model s and model x cash deliveries at a relatively consistent combined average selling price in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year 

automotive leasing revenue increased 183 million or 21 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct salestype leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer these increases were partially offset by the decreases in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined 

services and other revenue increased 80 million or 4 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to an increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow an increase in retail merchandise revenue and an increase in sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers as we had a partial year of sales in the prior year from our midyear 2019 acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in used vehicle revenue driven by a reduction in nontesla tradeins 

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives

2020 compared to 2019 

energy generation and storage revenue increased by 463 million or 30 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to increases in deployments of megapack solar cash and loan jobs and powerwall partially offset by a decrease in deployments of powerpack and reduced average selling prices on our solar cash and loan jobs as a result of our low cost solar strategy powerpack deployments have decreased following the introduction of our megapack product which we began deploying in late 2019

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 104   million  or 23  in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct salestype leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all cost of revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer these increases were partially offset by the decreases in cost of automotive lease revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined  

cost of services and other revenue decreased 99 million or 4 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to a decrease in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by a reduction in nontesla tradeins partially offset by increases in nonwarranty maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow and an increase in costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased 

gross margin for total automotive increased from 21 to 26 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to an improvement of model 3 gross margin primarily from lower material manufacturing freight and duty costs from localized procurement and manufacturing in china partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of model 3 due to a higher proportion of model 3 standard range variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year additionally there was an increase of 986 million in sales of regulatory credits and a positive impact from model y deliveries in 2020 as model y gross margin was higher than our prior year total automotive gross margin these increases were partially offset by idle capacity charges of 213 million as a result of a temporary suspension of production at the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada during the first half of 2020 

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment increased from 17 to 22 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and a lower proportion of services and other which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business within the segment in the year ended december 31 2020 additionally there was an improvement in our nonwarranty maintenance services gross margin due to increased operational efficiencies despite additional costs from ramping service centers to accommodate a larger deployed fleet and an improvement in our used vehicle sales gross margin 

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand in agreements for solar energy system and ppas where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs

2020 compared to 2019 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 635 million or 47 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to increases in deployments of megapack higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our solar roof ramp increases in deployments of powerwall and idle capacity charges of 20 million as a result of temporary suspension of production at gigafactory new york during the first half of 2020 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in deployments of powerpack 

gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 12 to 1 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to a higher proportion of solar roof in our overall energy business which operated at lower gross margins as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp additionally there were lower gross margins in our solar cash and loan business from reduced average selling prices as a result of our low cost solar strategy partially offset by lower materials and manufacturing costs 

research and development expense

 



 

research and development “rd” expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense

 

rd expenses increased 148   million  or 11  in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  the increase was primarily due to a 62 million increase in expensed materials as we continue to expand our product roadmap  61 million increase in stockbased compensation expense primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price 20 million increase in facilities freight and depreciation expenses and a 20 million increase in employee and labor related expenses 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 55 to 47 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease is primarily an increase in total revenues from expanding sales partially offset by an increase in our rd expenses as detailed above 

selling general and administrative expense

 



 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements

sga expenses increased 499 million or 19 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase is primarily due to an increase of 625 million in stockbased compensation expense of which 542 million was attributable to the 2018 ceo performance award we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 838 million in the year ended december 31 2020 for the 2018 ceo performance award compared to 296 million in the prior year of the expense recorded in fiscal year 2020 232 million was due to cumulative catchup expense for the service provided from the grant date when three operational milestones under such award were considered probable of being met and the remaining unamortized expense of 357 million for the first four tranches were recognized upon vesting as the first four market capitalization milestones were achieved see note 14 equity incentive plans  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the remaining stockbased compensation expense increase of 83 million attributable to other directors and employees is primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price the increase in stockbased compensation was partially offset by a decrease of 90 million in customer promotional costs facilitiesrelated expenses and sales and marketing activities additionally there was a reduction to operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the amount of 43 million for the settlement in part of the securities litigation relating to the solarcity acquisition see note 16 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—securities litigation relating to the solarcity acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

sga expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 11 to 10 in year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease is primarily from an increase in total revenues from expanding sales partially offset by an increase in our sga expenses as detailed above 

restructuring and other

 



 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency there were no restructuring actions in the year ended december 31 2020

interest expense

 



 

 

interest expense increased by 63   million  or 9  in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to 105 million of losses on extinguishment of debt in fiscal year 2020 from early conversions on our convertible senior notes  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate as compared to the prior year and an increase of 17 million in the amount of interest we capitalized from the consolidated statements of operations to property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets increased capitalization results in lower interest expense the amount of interest we capitalize is driven by our construction in progress balance which increased yearoveryear due to our construction and expansion of multiple factories 

other income expense net

 



 

other expense income net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates

other expense income net changed unfavorably by 167 million in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the unfavorable change was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the us dollar depreciating greater than 5 against the euro and the chinese yuan in 2020 compared to an appreciation of 2 and 1 against the same currencies in the prior year respectively 

provision for income taxes

 



 

our provision for income taxes increased by 182 million or 165 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was primarily due to the substantial increases in taxable profits in our foreign jurisdictions yearoveryear 

our effective tax rate increased from 17 to 25 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to substantial pretax income in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to a pretax loss for the year ended december 31 2019

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

 



 

our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests increased by 54 million or 62 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was primarily due to lower activities from new financing fund arrangements 

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2020 we had 1938 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 676 billion and consisted primarily of euros chinese yuan and canadian dollars our sources of cash are 

 

predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings 

our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products and technologies including our announced proprietary battery cells ongoing production and additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the fremont factory gigafactory nevada gigafactory shanghai and gigafactory new york the construction of gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities 

as discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—management opportunities challenges and risks and 2021 outlook—cash flow and capital expenditure trends in this annual report on form 10k we currently expect our capital expenditures to be 450 to 600 billion in 2021 and in each of the next two fiscal years 

we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our nearterm debt obligations although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources for example our local subsidiary has entered into credit facilities to support construction and production at gigafactory shanghai see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k as always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business 

in january 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity as part of the policy we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets thereafter we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin under this policy moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt we believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid however digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them 

we have an agreement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period beginning april 30 2018 which we expect to meet through our operations as we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at gigafactory new york pursuant to a new york state executive order issued in march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we were granted a oneyear deferral of our obligation to be compliant as of april 30 2020 with our applicable targets under such agreement

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months even considering the expected levels of capital expenditures in the current and next two fiscal years a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network for example if our nearterm manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected including due to global economic conditions and levels of consumer outlook and spend impacting demand in the worldwide transportation automotive and energy product industries we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures we may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

in addition we had 263 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of december 31 2020 some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts our interests in financing funds or various other assets and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds for details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds  refer to note 12 debt  and note 17 variable interest entity arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

summary of cash flows

 



 

 

cash flows from operating activities

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicles in transit our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales customer lease payments customer deposits cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process operating expenses operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 354 billion to 594 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 from 240 billion during the year ended december 31 2019 this increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of 282 billion the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 533 million and 188 million of the repayment of our 025 convertible senior notes due in 2019 during the three months ended march 31 2019 which represents the portion of the repayment that was classified as an operating activity as this represented an interest payment on the deeplydiscounted convertible senior notes the decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at the fremont factory and gigafactory shanghai the decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue primarily due to delivery of regulatory credits in 2020 under a previous arrangement where we had received payment in advance as of december 31 2019 a larger increase in operating lease vehicles as model 3 direct leasing was introduced in the second quarter of 2019 and model y direct leasing was introduced in the third quarter of 2020 and a larger increase in accounts receivables of government rebates already passed through to customers

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

foreign currency risk

we transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and british pound in relation to our current year operations in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar for our foreign subsidiaries accordingly changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income loss as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances for the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a net foreign currency loss of 114 million in other expense income net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the us dollar euro and canadian dollar as our subsidiaries’ monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in various local currencies for the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized a net foreign currency gain of 48 million in other expense income  net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the us dollar british pound and canadian dollar  

we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm these changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income loss before income taxes these changes would have resulted in a benefit of 8 million at december 31 2020 and an adverse impact of 362 million at december 31 2019 assuming no foreign currency hedging

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates on our floating rate debt would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 by 4 million and 8 million respectively

generally we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities we also intend to further increase costcompetitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing including at our planned gigafactory berlin 

supply chain

our products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world we have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells electronics and complex vehicle assemblies certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale 

as is the case for most automotive companies most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers certain key components we use have multiple available sources and we work to qualify multiple suppliers for each such component where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply we also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times 

our products use various raw materials including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control such as supply and demand and market speculation we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies in order to meet the needs of our operations

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

globally both the operation of our business by us and the ownership of our products by our customers are impacted by a number of government programs incentives and other arrangements our business and products are also subject to a number of governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions

 

programs and incentives 

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives

we have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority “caeatfa” that provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of model s model x model 3 model y and future electric vehicles and the expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in california 

gigafactory nevada—nevada tax incentives

in connection with the construction of gigafactory nevada we have entered into agreements with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that provide abatements for sales use real property personal property and employer excise taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits these incentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on october 17 2014 and ending on either june 30 2024 or june 30 2034 depending on the incentive under these agreements we were eligible for a maximum of 1950 million of transferable tax credits subject to capital investments by us and our partners for gigafactory nevada of at least 350 billion which we exceeded during 2017 and specified hiring targets for gigafactory nevada which we exceeded during 2018 as a result as of december 31 2018 we had earned the maximum amount of credits

gigafactory new york—new york state investment and lease

we have a lease through the research foundation for the state university of new york the “suny foundation” for gigafactory new york which was constructed on behalf of the suny foundation under the lease and a related research and development agreement there continues to be on behalf of the suny foundation installation of certain utilities and other improvements and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment designated by us to be used at gigafactory new york the terms of such agreement require us to comply with a number of covenants including required hiring and cumulative investment targets which we have met to date as of the applicable measurement dates 

gigafactory shanghai—lease and land use rights

we have a lease arrangement with the local government of shanghai for land use rights at gigafactory shanghai under the terms of the arrangement we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023 which we believe will be attainable even if our actual vehicle production at gigafactory shanghai were far lower than the volumes we are forecasting

tesla regulatory credits

in connection with the production delivery placement into service and ongoing operation of our zero emission vehicles charging infrastructure and solar systems in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits we have sold these credits and will continue to sell future credits to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements for example under california’s zero emission vehicle regulation and those of states that have adopted california’s standard vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits referred to as zev credits for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements these laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws tesla also earns other types of saleable regulatory credits in the united states and abroad including greenhouse gas fuel economy renewable energy and clean fuels credits likewise several us states have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production these requirements enable companies deploying solar energy to earn tradable credits known as solar renewable energy certificates “srecs”

 

energy storage systems—incentives 

the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development nevertheless there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage for example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 26 tax credit in 2020 with a ramp down in 2021 and beyond under section 48a3 of the internal revenue code or the irc as described below in addition california and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program

the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets for example in late 2016 ferc issued a final rule order no 821 to further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets order 821 is currently under review before the us court of appeals for the dc circuit

solar energy systems—government and utility programs and incentives

us federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates

the federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit “itc” under two sections of the irc section 48 and section 25d section 48a3 of the irc allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 26 of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar energy system that commences construction by december 31 2020 the credit then declines to 22 in 2021 and a permanent 10 thereafter we claim the section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial projects based on ownership of the solar energy system the federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy systems section 25d of the irc allows a homeownertaxpayer to claim a credit of 26 of qualified expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by december 31 2020 the credit then declines to 22 in 2021 and is scheduled to expire thereafter customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash or through our solar loan offering are eligible to claim the section 25d investment tax credit

in addition to the federal itc many us states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentives for solar energy systems

regulations

vehicle safety and testing

our vehicles are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards “fmvss” our vehicles fully comply with all applicable fmvsss without the need for any exemptions and we expect future tesla vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies additionally there are regulatory changes being considered for several fmvss and while we anticipate compliance there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted

as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable fmvss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the us numerous fmvss apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements we are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by nhtsa including the cafe standards theft prevention act requirements consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted

 

our vehicles sold outside of the us are subject to similar foreign safety environmental and other regulations many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the us and may require redesign andor retesting the european union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that are scheduled to commence in 2020 and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union these changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in europe 

selfdriving

there are no federal us regulations pertaining to the safety of selfdriving vehicles however nhtsa has established recommended guidelines certain us states have legal restrictions on selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them this patchwork increases the legal complexity for our vehicles in europe certain vehicle safety regulations apply to selfdriving braking and steering systems and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of selfdriving vehicles selfdriving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the us and foreign countries and may create restrictions on selfdriving features that we develop

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation

state laws regulate the manufacture distribution sale and service of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state as we open additional tesla stores and service centers we secure dealer licenses or their equivalent and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers certain states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the transfer of title out of the state in such states we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur

as we expand our retail footprint in the us some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations we expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model in addition we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations and we intend to actively fight any such efforts to limit our ability to sell and service our own vehicles

battery safety and testing

our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation the regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation such as by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations

we use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products the use storage and disposal of our battery packs is regulated under federal law we have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs and we are also developing our own recycling technology 

solar energy—general

we are not a “regulated utility” in the us although we are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers to operate our systems we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities in most cases interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been preapproved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body 

sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases ppas and subscription agreements face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions

 

solar energy—net metering 

most states in the us have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their onsite solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so

solar energy—mandated renewable capacity

many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production such as an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or rps or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources such as solar energy systems in srec state markets the rps requires electricity suppliers to secure a portion of their electricity from solar generators the srec program provides a means for the generation of srecs which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entities who surrender the srecs to the state to prove compliance with the state’s renewable energy mandate

competition 

automotive

the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader crosssection of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles’ capabilities

we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology for example model s and model x compete primarily with premium sedans and premium suvs and model 3 and model y compete with small to mediumsized sedans and compact suvs which are extremely competitive markets competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers however many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the us china and europe and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles in addition several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles including plugin versions 

our vehicles also compete in the market based on the compelling user experience that they offer we believe that a key factor in our success will be our autopilot and fsd technologies that currently enable the driverassistance features in our vehicles and in which we are making significant strides through our proprietary and powerful fsd computer and remotely updateable artificial intelligence software ultimately while we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have no control our goal is a fully autonomouslydriven future that improves safety and provides our customers with convenience and additional income through participation in an autonomous tesla ridehailing network this network which will also include our own fleet of vehicles will also allow us to access a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve finally our vehicles offer unparalleled invehicle entertainment features currently including internet search music services passenger karaoke and parked video streaming and gaming

 

energy generation and storage 

energy storage systems

the market for energy storage products is also highly competitive established companies such as aes energy storage siemens lg chem and samsung as well as various emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio there are several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems such as cells battery modules and power electronics as well as others providing integrated systems we compete with these companies based on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specifications of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our powerpack and megapack products give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products

solar energy systems

the primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers we compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems we also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations in the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitors include vivint solar inc sunrun inc trinity solar sunpower corporation and many smaller local solar companies

the electricity produced by solar installations still represents a small fraction of total us electricity generation with tens of millions of singlefamily homes and businesses in our primary service territories and many more in other locations we have a large opportunity to expand and grow this business as we make our retrofit installations more accessible and ramp our innovative solar roof we also believe that residential solar energy generation is gaining favorable regulatory momentum as exemplified in part by the state of california recently requiring that new homes be built with solar generation starting in 2020

intellectual property 

we place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio as part of our business we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other measures including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements for example we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio we have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world 

employees 

as of december 31 2019 tesla inc had 48016 fulltime employees to date we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business and industry

we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays or other complications in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of our vehicles energy products and product features or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets which could harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

we have previously experienced launch and production ramp delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models such as model s model x and model 3 and new vehicle features such as the allwheel drive dual motor drivetrain on model s and the second version of our autopilot hardware for example we encountered unanticipated supply chain constraints that led to initial delays in producing model x and an isolated supplier limitation in the manufacture of model 3 similarly during our initial model 3 production ramp we had challenges ramping fully automated processes such as portions of the battery module assembly line material flow system and the general assembly line which we addressed by reducing the levels of automation and introducing semiautomated or manual processes in addition we have used a number of new manufacturing technologies techniques and processes for our vehicles such as aluminum spot welding systems and highspeed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts and we may introduce new processes in the future we have also introduced unique design features in our vehicles with different manufacturing challenges such as large display screens dual motor drivetrain hardware for our autopilot and fsd features and falconwing doors there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale any such new processes or features

in particular our future business depends in large part on the highvolume production of model 3 and model y which we believe are our vehicles with the largest markets we have limited experience to date in manufacturing model 3 at high volumes and continuously increasing its production rates particularly across multiple vehicle manufacturing facilities which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019 with gigafactory shanghai coming online in order to be successful we will need to implement maintain andor ramp efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances high quality and maximum output rates we have planned including at gigafactory shanghai and for model y which we commenced manufacturing at the fremont factory in the first quarter of 2020 bottlenecks such as those we have experienced in the past with new product ramps and other unexpected challenges may also arise as we ramp production and it will be important that we address them promptly while continuing to reduce our manufacturing costs if we are not successful in doing so or if we experience issues with our ongoing manufacturing process improvements and costdown efforts we could face delays in establishing andor sustaining our model 3 and model y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets 

moreover we will need to hire train and compensate skilled employees to operate highvolume production facilities to support our vehicle ramp at the fremont factory and gigafactory shanghai as well as at gigafactory nevada to support the manufacture of battery packs and drive units for certain of our vehicles finally because our vehicle models in particular model 3 and model y may share certain parts suppliers or production facilities with each other the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact also the production of other models or lead to bottlenecks that impact the production of all models 

we may also experience similar future delays or other complications in launching andor ramping production of new vehicles such as tesla semi cybertruck and the new tesla roadster our energy storage products and the solar roof as well as future features and services such as new autopilot or fsd features and the autonomous tesla ridehailing network likewise we may encounter delays with the design construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities including our planned gigafactory berlin in germany 

 

any significant delay or other complication in the production ramp of our current products or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future products features and services including complications associated with expanding our production capacity and supply chain or obtaining or maintaining related regulatory approvals or inability to manage such ramps costeffectively could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to meet our growing product sales delivery and installation plans and vehicle servicing and charging network needs or accurately project and manage this growth internationally any of which could harm our business and prospects

concurrent with developing launching and ramping our products our success will depend on our ability to continue to significantly increase their sales deliveries installations and servicing worldwide while allocating our available resources among multiple products simultaneously as we expand globally we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale installation and service of our products the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of superchargers in various jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense these plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will ultimately generate additional sales or installations of our products 

we continuously evaluate and as appropriate evolve our retail operations and product offerings in order to maximize our reach and optimize our costs vehicle lineup and model differentiation and purchasing experience however there is no guarantee that each step in our evolving strategy will be perceived as intended by prospective customers accustomed to more traditional sales models in particular we are targeting with model 3 and model y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers in which we have limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products until we ramp local production at gigafactory shanghai and in the future at gigafactory berlin we will have to contend with predominantly singlefactory vehicle production at the fremont factory for numerous international variants if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate we may not be able to timely generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with our operations in a given region which may negatively impact our deliveries and operating results in a particular period likewise as we develop and grow our energy storage product and solar business worldwide our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand for our products in different markets 

moreover because we do not have independent dealer networks we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers and meeting their vehicle servicing needs while we have substantially implemented and improved many aspects of our delivery and service operations we still have relatively limited experience with and may face difficulties in such deliveries and servicing at high volumes particularly in international markets as we expand for example significant transit time may be required to transport vehicles in volume into international markets and we also saw challenges in initially ramping our logistical channels in china and europe as we delivered model 3 there for the first time in the first quarter of 2019 to accommodate growing volumes we have deployed a number of delivery models such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces some of which have not been previously tested at scale and in different geographies and may not ultimately be successful likewise because of our unique expertise with our vehicles we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by our service centers mobile service technicians or certain authorized professionals that we have specifically trained and equipped if we experience delays in adding such servicing capacity or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles particular highervolume and newer additions to our fleet such as model 3 and model y it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory finally the increasing number of tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world 

we are also expanding our installation capabilities for the solar roof as we continue its manufacturing ramp by training both our own personnel and third party installers if we are not successful in growing this overall installation capability to keep pace with our increasing production or if we experience unforeseen delays in the production ramp or inaccurately forecast demand for the solar roof our operating results may be negatively impacted

 

there is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales delivery servicing charging and installation targets globally that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations moreover we may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs adapt our products and conduct our operations to meet local requirements and regulations  implement required local infrastructure systems and processes and find and hire a significant number of additional sales service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel if we fail to manage our growth effectively it could result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles we operate in the automotive industry which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility 

our growth is highly dependent upon the worldwide adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular although we have successfully grown demand for our vehicles thus far there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicles will not compete with one another in the market moreover the target demographics for our vehicles in particular the mass market demographic for model 3 and model y are highly competitive if the market for electric vehicles in general and tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be harmed 

we have only relatively recently achieved highvolume production of vehicles and are still at an earlier stage and have limited resources relative to our competitors moreover the market for alternative fuel vehicles is rapidly evolving as a result the market for our vehicles could be affected by numerous factors such as 















in addition sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to increased volatility especially as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies specifically it is uncertain as to how such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a company that has been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales

 

we are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are singlesource suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products according to our schedule and at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our products contain thousands of purchased parts that we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers we attempt to mitigate our supply chain risk by entering into longterm agreements where it is practical and beneficial to do so including agreements we entered into with panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier qualifying and obtaining components from multiple sources where sensible such as the pv panels for our retrofit solar installations that we purchase from a variety of suppliers and maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times however our limited and in most cases singlesource supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for our production such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slowerthanplanned model s and model x ramps furthermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars governmental changes tariffs natural disasters such as the march 2011 earthquakes in japan health epidemics and other factors beyond our and our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis the loss of any supplier particularly a single or limitedsource supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from our suppliers could lead to product design changes production delays of key revenuegenerating products idle manufacturing facilities and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing servicing and supporting our products any of which could result in negative publicity damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

we may also be impacted by changes in our supply chain or production needs we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to our design changes likewise any significant increases in our production such as for model 3 and our expectations for model y has required andor may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time our suppliers may not ultimately be able to sustainably and timely meet our cost quality and volume needs requiring us to replace them with other sources while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components additionally we continuously negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms seek new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempt to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer

outside of the us we have limited manufacturing experience and we may experience issues or delays increasing the level of localized procurement at our gigafactory shanghai and in the future at our gigafactory berlin furthermore as the scale of our vehicle production increases we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport components to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally and at much higher volumes if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

any problems or delays in expanding gigafactory nevada or ramping and maintaining operations there could negatively affect the production and profitability of our products such as model 3 model y and our energy storage products in addition the battery cells produced there store large amounts of energy

to lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume we have vertically integrated the production of lithiumion cells at gigafactory nevada where we also manufacture battery packs and drive units for certain vehicles and energy storage products and assemble our megapack product production of lithiumion cells at gigafactory nevada began in 2017 and we have no other direct experience in the production of lithiumion cells given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in issues or delays in further ramping our products and expanding production output at gigafactory nevada 

 

in order to achieve our volume and gross margin targets for our vehicles and energy storage products we must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at gigafactory nevada which among other things requires panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp its cell production lines at significant volumes although panasonic has a long track record of producing highquality cells at significant volume at its factories in japan it has relatively limited experience with cell production at gigafactory nevada in addition we produce several components for model 3 and model y such as battery modules incorporating the lithium ion cells produced by panasonic and drive units including to support gigafactory shanghai production at gigafactory nevada some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity while we have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying multiple semiautomated lines and improving our original lines additional bottlenecks may arise as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines if we are unable to maintain gigafactory nevada production ramp output additionally over time as needed and do so costeffectively or if we or panasonic are unable to hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel our ability to supply battery packs or other components for model 3 model y and our other products could be negatively impacted which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

in addition the high volumes of lithiumion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at gigafactory nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such disruptions or issues could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines costs and production at or funding the ramp of gigafactory shanghai or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there could adversely impact our business prospects operating results and financial condition

as part of our continuing work to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis and in order to make them affordable in international markets by accessing local supply chains and workforces we have established gigafactory shanghai in china currently we have installed annual production capacity for 150000 model 3 vehicles there that we believe we will eventually be able to push to actual rates of production in excess of such number  and we have commenced construction of the next phase of gigafactory shanghai to add model y manufacturing capacity at least equivalent to that for model 3  the ramp and further expansion of gigafactory shanghai are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements maintenance of operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion potential supply chain constraints hiring training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture highquality units at scale we have limited experience to date with operating manufacturing facilities abroad and only recently began to sell model 3 in china if we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines costs capital efficiency and production capacity for gigafactory shanghai or in maintaining and complying with the terms of local debt financing that we intend will largely fund it or in generating and maintaining demand locally for the vehicles we manufacture at gigafactory shanghai our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

in particular local manufacturing is critical to our expansion and sales in china which is the largest market for electric vehicles in the world our vehicle sales in china have been negatively impacted in the past by certain tariffs on automobiles manufactured in the us such as our vehicles and our costs for producing our vehicles in the us have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced from china if we are not able to successfully and timely ramp gigafactory shanghai we may continue to be exposed to the impact of such unfavorable tariffs duties or costs to our detriment compared to locallybased competitors 

 

we face risks associated with our international operations including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory political economic tax and labor conditions and with establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business 

we have a global footprint with domestic and international operations and subsidiaries accordingly we are subject to a variety of legal political and regulatory requirements and social environmental and economic conditions over which we have little control for example we may be impacted by trade policies environmental conditions political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations which are inherently unpredictable we are subject to a number of risks associated in particular with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention these risks include conforming our products to various international regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures organizing local operating entities difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations challenges in attracting customers foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements our ability to enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of materials in particular for lithiumion cells could harm our business

we may experience increases in the cost of or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various materials in our business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers the prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased production of electric vehicles and energy storage products by our competitors and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells these risks include







our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage products while we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells manufactured at our own facilities we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for energy products until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs substantial increases in the prices for our materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by battery cell suppliers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices any attempts to increase product prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations of orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results

 

if our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed 

if our vehicles or our energy products contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as new autopilot or fsd features take longer than expected to become enabled are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks issues experienced by vehicle customers have included those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen as well as the panoramic roof and the 12volt battery in the model s and the seats and doors in the model x although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not be to the satisfaction of our customers while we have performed extensive internal testing on the products we manufacture we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs powertrains vehicles and energy storage products there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers 

any product defects delays or legal restrictions on product features or other failure of our products to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays product recalls product liability claims breach of warranty claims and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims

although we design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road product liability claims even those without merit could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected as is true for other automakers our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury and such crashes where autopilot or fsd features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of new technologies that we are pioneering including autopilot and fsd features in our vehicles in addition the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur in particular due to a highspeed crash which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or redesign efforts all of which would be time consuming and expensive

moreover as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause injury to people or property a successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicles and energy storage products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results in most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds not by insurance 

 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industries we currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from companies with new technology 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future there is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete a significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and applications in some cases such competitors have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sales resources and networks than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products in particular some competitors have also announced plans to compete with us in important and large markets for electric vehicles such as china and in europe increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition model 3 and model y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan and compact suv market including bmw ford lexus mercedes and volkswagen group

the solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive we face competition from other manufacturers developers and installers of solar and energy storage systems as well as from large utilities decreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and ppas moreover prices for solar product components and prices per kwh for lithiumion battery cells have declined and may continue to decline which may adversely impact our ability to costeffectively manufacture such components ourselves

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industries or are subject to negative publicity then our financial condition operating results business prospects and access to capital may suffer materially

consumers may be less likely to purchase our products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operations will continue in the long term similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts ratings agencies and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors including those that are largely outside of our control such as our limited operating history customer unfamiliarity with our products any delays in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operations to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services and our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations 

in particular tesla’s products business results of operations statements and actions are wellpublicized by a range of third parties such attention includes frequent criticism which is often exaggerated or unfounded such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team any such negative perceptions whether caused by us or not could harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed

 

if we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing programs our business may suffer 

we offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we also currently offer leasing directly through our local subsidiaries for model s model x and model 3 in the us and for model s and model x in canada under a lease held directly by us we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease the profitability of any vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles for example we made certain adjustments to our vehicle prices during 2019 to reflect anticipated changes to our cost structure from periodically optimizing our retail strategy and as a limited accommodation to customers in consideration of a reduction in the electric vehicle federal tax credit such pricing changes may impact the residual values of our vehicles the leasing program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk we expect the availability of leasing and other financing options will be important for our vehicle customers if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers we may be unable to grow our deliveries furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties either of which may harm our business

moreover we have provided resale value guarantees to customers and partners for certain financing programs under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined amounts however actual resale values as with residual values for leased vehicles are subject to similar fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above if the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the predetermined amounts we have offered our operating results profitability andor liquidity could be negatively impacted

the unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determinations with respect to government and economic incentives in the us and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles energy storage products or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our products and services 

we and our customers currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the us and abroad such incentives include tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles specific policies in place around the world include exempting the purchase of electric vehicles from import taxes value added taxes or carbon dioxide and weightbased purchase taxes such programs could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example under current regulations a 7500 federal tax credit that was available in the us for the purchase of our vehicles was reduced in phases during 2019 and ended on december 31 2019 we believe that this sequential phaseout likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into the periods preceding each reduction moreover in july 2018 a previously available incentive for purchases of model 3 in ontario canada was cancelled and tesla buyers in germany lost access to electric vehicle incentives for a short period of time beginning late 2017 in april 2017 and january 2016 respectively previously available incentives in hong kong and denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired negatively impacting sales effective march 2016 california implemented regulations phasing out a 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for highincome consumers such developments could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles and we and our customers may have to adjust to them

 

in addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds however these incentives may expire on a particular date when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase sometimes without warning for example the us federal government currently offers an investment tax credit itc for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility however the itc is currently schedul ed to decline in phases from 26  for qualifying solar systems for which constru ction began by december 31 2020  to 10 for commercial and utility systems and to 0 for customerowned residential systems for which construction begins after december 31 2021 likewise in jurisdictions where net energy metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use several jurisdictions have reduced altered or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so such reductions in or termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results by making our products less competitive for potential customers increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets 

moreover we and our fund investors claim the itc and certain state incentives in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar and energy storage systems although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower and they may do so again in the future such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors

any failure by us to comply with the terms of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory new york could result in negative consequences for our business

we are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the suny foundation these agreements provide for the construction and use of our gigafactory in buffalo new york which we have primarily used for the development and production of our solar roof and other solar products and components energy storage components and supercharger components and for other lessorapproved functions under this agreement we are obligated to among other things directly employ specified minimum numbers of personnel in the state of new york and spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period beginning april 30 2018 while we expect significant operations at gigafactory new york and the surrounding buffalo area to continue including with our ramp and manufacture of the solar roof if we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations we would be obligated to pay a “program payment” of 412 million to the suny foundation for such year any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts to the suny foundation the termination of our lease at gigafactory new york andor the need to adjust certain of our operations in particular our production ramp of the solar roof or supercharger components any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

if we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer 

none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel especially to support our highvolume manufacture of vehicles expansion plans and technological innovation and any failure or delay in doing so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

 

key talent may leave tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to us in california nevada and other regions where we have operations including outside of the us there is increasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineering manufacturing engineering and other skills such as electrical and building construction expertise this competition affects our ability to retain and hire key employees moreover we have in the past conducted reductions in force in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and certain senior personnel have also departed for various reasons our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner especially to support our expansion plans and to retain current employees or replace departed senior employees with qualified and experienced individuals which is typically a timeconsuming process additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities difficulties in retaining or recruiting employees could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins with an emphasis on equitybased awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the longterm interests of our stockholders we have to periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards that may be granted and shares that may be purchased under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans if we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals to obtain future increases to the number of awards that may be granted and shares that may be purchased under such plans and compensate our personnel in accordance with our compensation philosophy our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel would be negatively impacted

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies corp a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures

we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed to protect our systems against breaches and cyberattacks if these efforts are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted or our intellectual property could be compromised as a result of which our operating results and reputation could be harmed 

we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems and deploying such systems globally to assist us in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the us and abroad including at gigafactory shanghai such as systems for product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems we also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft data breaches and other cyberattacks the implementation maintenance segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes these risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations 

 

we cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded as planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results moreover our proprietary information or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products and harm our business

our products contain complex information technology systems for example our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our products and their systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks products and systems to gain control of or to change our products’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products we encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability accordingly we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be exploited in the future before they can be identified or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful

any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our products their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products their systems or data are capable of being “hacked” could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have been the subject of such reports in the past

we are subject to substantial laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations including as they evolve could negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities and substantially harm our business and operating results 

as a manufacturing company including with respect to our current facilities such as the fremont factory gigafactory nevada gigafactory new york and gigafactory shanghai and our future facility at gigafactory berlin we are or will be subject to complex environmental manufacturing health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the us china germany and other locations abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage recycling disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials and with respect to constructing expanding and maintaining our facilities the costs of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws may be significant we may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities which would hinder our operation of these facilities such costs and delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results furthermore any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties remediation costs third party damages or a suspension or cessation of our operations

 

in addition motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of automobiles internationally for example in countries outside of the us we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emissions among other things that are often materially different from requirements in the us thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries this process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements 

in particular we offer in our vehicles autopilot and fsd features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but which currently require drivers to remain engaged we are continuing to develop our fsd technology with the goal of achieving full selfdriving capability in the future there is a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and availability any of which could adversely affect our business

finally as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by thirdparty owned systems for example existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit utilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with their solar energy systems charge fees and penalties to our customers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate designs such that the price of our solar products may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict us and our customers from transacting under our ppas or qualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering if such regulations and policies are adopted or if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

failure to comply with a variety of us and international privacy and consumer protection laws to which we are subject could harm the company 

our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws and in particular certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation and application for example in may 2018 the general data protection regulation began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the european union and has created new compliance obligations and has significantly increased fines for noncompliance similarly beginning in january 2020 the california consumer privacy act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to california residents although we take steps to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand

 

our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities 

it is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the us mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory from time to time labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the national labor relations board and they may do so in the future in september 2019 an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for tesla on certain issues and against us on certain others the national labor relations board has not yet adopted the recommendation and we have appealed certain aspects of the recommended decision any unfavorable ultimate outcome for tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of tesla’s treatment of our employees furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition

we may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance 

any product recall with respect to our products may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition for example certain vehicle recalls that we initiated have resulted from various causes including a component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged a concern with the firmware in the restraints control module in certain righthanddrive vehicles industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier model x seat components that could cause unintended seat movement during a collision and concerns of corrosion in model s and model x power steering assist motor bolts furthermore testing of our products by government regulators or industry groups may require us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that we have provided to other vehicle oems including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used tesla vehicles and production powertrain components and systems we sell in addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell and we pass through to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers’ warranties finally we offer a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their ppa or lease under these performance guarantees we bear the risk of electricity production shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel failure these risks are exacerbated in the event the panel or inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserves include our management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as model 3 model y and the solar roof that we have recently introduced andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future 

 

our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks 

we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of god and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage as a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors

we expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities may not be consistent or linear between periods additionally our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who may be focused only on quarterly financial results if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness

as of december 31 2019 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 1249 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions we and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt

pursuant to their terms holders of our 125 convertible senior notes due 2021 2375 convertible senior notes due 2022 and 200 convertible senior notes due 2024 together the “tesla convertible notes” may convert their respective tesla convertible notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective tesla convertible notes under certain circumstances upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible notes we will be obligated to deliver cash andor shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such tesla convertible notes moreover our subsidiary’s zerocoupon convertible senior notes due 2020 the “subsidiary convertible notes” are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 30000 per share finally holders of the tesla convertible notes and the subsidiary convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date

 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire  depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

the terms of certain of our credit facilities including the credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt in addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio as a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it 

we may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected

the design manufacture sale installation andor servicing of automobiles energy storage products and solar products is a capitalintensive business and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles energy storage products andor solar products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness we need sufficient capital to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products establishment andor increases of model 3 and model y production capacity at the fremont factory and at gigafactory shanghai the continued expansion of gigafactory nevada the construction of gigafactory berlin the manufacturing ramp of the solar roof at gigafactory new york and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected

 

we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings 

we are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k to our knowledge no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred however we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the sec the doj or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future moreover we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceedings

for example on october 16 2018 the us district court for the southern district of new york entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the court on september 29 2018 in connection with the actions taken by the sec relating to mr musk’s statement on august 7 2018 that he was considering taking tesla private pursuant to the settlement we among other things paid a civil penalty of 20 million appointed an independent director as the chair of the board appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governancerelated matters on april 26 2019 this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previouslyagreed disclosure procedures which was subsequently approved by the court all other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us 

if we update or discontinue the use of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected we may have to shorten the useful lives of any equipment to be retired as a result of any such update and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial results

we have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in what we believe is state of the art tooling machinery and other manufacturing equipment for our various product lines and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful lives however manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cuttingedge equipment more quickly than expected moreover we are continually implementing learnings as our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase which may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment alternatively as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels our learnings may cause us to discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results

we transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro japanese yen canadian dollar chinese yuan and norwegian krone to the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies any strengthening of the us dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars as we have historically experienced in addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact as a result our operating results could be adversely affected

 

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

we sell our vehicles directly to consumers using means that we believe will maximize our reach currently including through our website and our own stores while we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in each state in the us as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model in some states we have also opened galleries to educate and inform customers about our products but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles the application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so

in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws we have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model in some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model a few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate 

internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs 

others including our competitors may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights while we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors accordingly we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses in addition if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services in the event that we were required to take one or more such actions our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention

 

our facilities or operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control such as natural disasters  wars or health epidemics 

we may be impacted by natural disasters wars health epidemics or other events outside of our control for example our corporate headquarters the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada are located in seismically active regions in northern california and nevada and our gigafactory shanghai is located in a floodprone area if major disasters such as earthquakes floods or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products in addition beginning in late 2019 the media has reported a public health epidemic originating in china prompting precautionary governmentimposed closures of certain travel and business gigafactory shanghai was closed for a brief time as a result before it reopened in february 2020 and rejoined our us factories which had continued to operate it is unknown whether and how global supply chains particularly for automotive parts may be affected if such an epidemic persists for an extended period of time we may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile

the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 96899 per share and a low of 17699 per share over the last 52 weeks the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in particular a large proportion of our common stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies moreover stockholder litigation like this has been filed against us in the past while we defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline 

we may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance which may include projections regarding sales and production as well as anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions if our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly

 

transactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

the conversion of some or all of the tesla convertible notes or the subsidiary convertible notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes our subsidiary convertible notes have been historically and the other tesla convertible notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances if holders elect to convert their convertible notes we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

moreover in connection with each issuance of the tesla convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible notes we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes

elon musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings if mr musk were forced to sell these shares in order to satisfy his loan obligations such sales could cause our stock price to decline

certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to elon musk our chief executive officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third party participants in such offerings and placements we are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further

antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and other provisions of delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations in addition the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2017related items refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2018 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 19 2019

overview and 2019 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products we also offer maintenance installation operation and other services related to our products

automotive

during 2019 we achieved annual vehicle delivery and production records of 367656 and 365232 total vehicles respectively we also laid the groundwork for our next phase of growth with the commencement of model 3 production at gigafactory shanghai preparations at the fremont factory for model y production which commenced in the first quarter of 2020 the selection of berlin germany as the site for our next factory for the european market and the unveiling of cybertruck we also continued to enhance our user experience through improved autopilot and fsd features including the introduction of a new powerful onboard fsd computer and a new smart summon feature and the expansion of a unique set of incar entertainment options

energy generation and storage

we revamped key aspects of our solar operations in 2019 by streamlining traditionally complex ordering permitting installation and backend service processes to enhance the customer experience especially for retrofit solar installations our solar deployments grew approximately 48 and 26 quarteroverquarter in the second half of the year we also deployed 165 gwh of energy storage in 2019 more than the aggregate of all prior years finally we further evolved our product offerings by launching the third generation of the solar roof for which we are expanding both our manufacturing and installation capabilities and megapack our largest utilityscale energy storage product to date 

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2020 outlook

automotive—production 

a key focus in 2020 will be our efforts towards establishing and expanding capacity for vehicle production at volume across three continents at the fremont factory we commenced model y production earlier than anticipated and combined with model 3 we have installed annual production capacity for 400000 vehicles we expect to further increase this capacity to 500000 vehicles through the installation of additional equipment 

at gigafactory shanghai we have installed annual production capacity for 150000 model 3 vehicles that we believe we will eventually be able to push to actual rates of production in excess of such number  subject to local production of battery packs which we began ramping there later than other processes we have commenced construction of the next phase of gigafactory shanghai to add model y manufacturing capacity at least equivalent to that for model 3 to finance our construction and expansion in december 2019 our local subsidiary entered into a rmb 90 billion or the equivalent amount in us dollars fixed asset term facility and a rmb 225 billion or the equivalent amount in us dollars working capital revolving facility part of which was used to repay a rmb 35 billion bridge loan entered into in march 2019  we are supplementing such financing with limited direct capital expenditures 

 

finally we have selected germany as the site of our next factory for manufacturing vehicles for the european marke t due to its strong manufacturing and engineering presence  however the construction of and ramp at gigafactory berlin as well as at gigafactory shanghai  are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements maintenance of operational licenses and approvals for additional e xpansion  potential supply chain constraints hiring training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture highquality units at scale  ultimately achieving increased total vehicle production costeffectively across all of our manufacturing operations will require that we timely address any bottlenecks that may arise as we ramp establish and maintain sustained supplier capacity and successfully utilize manufacturing processes at the maximum output rates that we have planned for them 

automotive—demand and sales

as the automotive industry continues to validate and grow the market for electric vehicles we are generating demand and new customers even without traditional marketing and with relatively low marketing costs and in 2019 our orders shifted to originating mostly from new customers without prior reservations production at gigafactory shanghai allows us to offer model 3 in china at competitive local pricing and more quickly which should drive further demand and opportunity in the world’s largest market for midsized premium sedans and we expect a similar impact in china for model y when we commence production there of this offering in the popular compact suv segment 

moreover the significant interest generated by our unveiling of cybertruck demonstrated our brand visibility innovation and viability across an increasing range of vehicle segments meanwhile we are making our existing vehicles incrementally more compelling including through a planned software update for fsdenabled vehicles to react to traffic lights and stop signs and navigate city intersections and additional functionality of both invehicle software and the tesla mobile app

 

on the other hand we may be impacted by trade and environmental policies political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations which are inherently unpredictable sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to increased volatility specifically it is uncertain as to how such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a company that has been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales finally we make certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business including as we introduce new vehicles and variants and optimize the pricing among them such pricing changes may impact our vehicles’ resale values and in turn our operating results for example if price reductions result in an increase to our estimates of the volume of vehicles that may potentially be returned to us under preexisting resale value guarantees provided to customers and partners for certain financing programs our gross profits may be reduced

automotive—deliveries and customer infrastructure

 

we continue to optimize our manufacturing and global delivery patterns to address higher volumes of our predominantly singlefactory production at the fremont factory we expect to alleviate any related issues through local production at gigafactory shanghai and eventually at gigafactory berlin 

we also continue to expand and invest in our servicing and charging locations and capabilities to keep pace with our customer vehicle fleet and ensure a convenient and efficient customer experience however if our customer vehicles particularly in the rapidly growing model 3 fleet experience unexpected reliability issues it could outpace and overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment

 

we expect to continue to grow our retrofit solar system deployments as we execute our new strategy including through compelling financing options such as a subscriptionbased offering which is currently available in california 

 

we are focused on training our personnel and third party partners to ramp i nstallations of our solar roof  and are also hiring rapidly for its ongoing manufacturing ramp at gigafactory new york we expect such ramp will support our significant operations and our compliance with minimum hiring and cumulative investment targets under our agreement with the suny foundation related to the construction and use of gigafactory new york however if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at buffalo or our production ramp of the solar roof prove incorrect we may incur additional expenses or substantial payments to the suny foundation 

finally with the introduction of our 3 mwh megapack we now offer an even greater variety of scalable energy storage products with a wide range of markets and applications and expect this product to drive additional interest from global project developers and utilities 

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses

our capital expenditures are difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time for example the curve of any new product ramp such as for model y and the solar roof is inherently subject to uncertainty of timing and if we are able to meet various milestones along such ramp more quickly than expected our capital expenditures may be accelerated we also continuously evaluate and as appropriate adjust our capital expenditures based on among other things our manufacturing plans for our various products which we may rebalance from time to time based on the mix of demand among them and other contingent factors the pace and prioritization of current projects under development and the addition of any new projects moreover we are generally increasing the capital efficiency of our projects with experience  and we may find that our actual capital expenditures on new projects are different than previously expected 

subject to the above considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramps for our products construction and expansion of our factories and pipeline of announced projects under development and consistent with our current strategy of using partners to manufacture battery cells as well as considering all other infrastructure growth we currently expect our average annual capital expenditures in 2020 and the two succeeding fiscal years to be 25 billion to 35 billion

we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future as we focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation as well as from increases in expected overall revenues from our expanding sales in particular our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business have already manifested in total operating expenses decreasing from 44 billion to 41 billion from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019 including restructuring and other charges meanwhile our total revenues increased from 215 billion to 246 billion in the same period

in march 2018 our stockholders approved the 2018 ceo performance award with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones we will incur significant noncash stockbased compensation expense for each tranche under this award after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met and if later than the grant date we will also have to record a cumulative catchup expense at such time such catchup expense may be material depending on the length of time elapsed from the grant date for example in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the result of an additional operational milestone becoming probable of achievement we recorded a cumulative catchup expense of 72 million for service provided from the grant date moreover as the expense for a tranche is recorded over the longer of i the expected achievement period of the relevant operational milestone and ii only if the related market capitalization milestone has not been achieved its expected achievement period the achievement of a market capitalization milestone earlier than expected may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized upon vesting of a tranche all remaining associated expense will be recognized immediately see note 14 equity incentive plans—2018 ceo performance award  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding the stockbased compensation relating to the 2018 ceo performance award

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

adoption of new revenue standard

on january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  “new revenue standard” using the modified retrospective method the new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

automotive segment

automotive sales revenue 

automotive sales without resale value guarantee 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot fsd features and overtheair software updates we recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business other features and services such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle revenue related to autopilot and fsd features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available 

at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns based on historical experience in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue 

costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot fsd features and overtheair software updates as our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

 

automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value

with the exception of two programs which are discussed within the automotive leasing section we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise the performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns as we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values the two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option and vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee where exercise is probable 

prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised for certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under asc 840 leases prior to january 1 2019 we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate the remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciated their value less estimated residual value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory

automotive regulatory credits 

in connection with the production and delivery of our zero emission vehicles in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable automotive regulatory credits we have sold these credits and will continue to sell future credits to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements for example under california’s zero emission vehicle regulation and those of states that have adopted california’s standard vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits referred to as zev credits for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements these laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws we also earn other types of saleable regulatory credits in the united states and abroad including greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuels credits  payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business we recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

automotive leasing revenue 

automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases

direct vehicle leasing program 

we have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in the us canada and in certain countries in europe as of december 31 2019 the direct vehicle leasing program is offered for all new model s model x and model 3 vehicles in the us and new model s and model x vehicles in canada qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for model s and model x leases may opt to purchase the vehicles for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases we record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue

we capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option 

we offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the united states these transactions entail a transfer of leases which we have originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner as control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard these transactions were accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with asc 840 leases  prior to january 1 2019  under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment is recorded within deferred revenue we amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheets and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases under asc 842 and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term consequently any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue the end customers can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months in cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue

 

vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee where exercise is probable 

for certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise we have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheets to used vehicle inventory

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage sales 

energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers including solar subscriptionbased arrangements upon adoption of asc 842 energy generation and storage sales revenue includes agreements for solar energy systems and ppas that commence after january 1 2019 as these are now accounted for under the new revenue standard sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business

for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance

 

in instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets however any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems as our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred 

as part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract in certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur

we record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term 

energy generation and storage leasing 

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under ppas prior to january 1 2019 we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term 

we capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and ppas which include the referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements

inventory valuation

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff

 

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results

warranties

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and production powertrain components and systems we sell in addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations

stockbased compensation

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions and espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being met if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized if additional operational milestones become probable stockbased compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catchup expense for the service provided since the grant date the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations

 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

income taxes

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2019 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity “vie” of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs  the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation

 

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value “hlbv” method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties the thirdparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets

 

 

results of operations

revenues

 



 

automotive  services and other segment

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash sales of new model s model x and model 3 vehicles including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot and fsd features and overtheair software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting 

automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for model s model x and model 3 vehicles under direct lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting we began offering direct leasing for model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue

 

201 9 compared to 201 8 

automotive sales revenue increased 232 billion or 13 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to an increase of 137969 model 3 cash deliveries from production scaling and an increase of 175 million in sales of regulatory credits to 594 million the increase was partially offset by a decrease of 30487 model s and model x cash deliveries the deliveries in the year ended december 31 2019 were at lower average selling prices than the prior year due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings and the introduction of lower end model 3 trims in 2019 due to the price adjustments we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments as a result along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of 555 million refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

automotive leasing revenue decreased 14 million or 2 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases the decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program partially due to the introduction of model 3 direct leasing in the second quarter of 2019 

services and other revenue increased 835 million or 60 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of tradein vehicles partially offset by lower average selling prices for tradedin tesla vehicles due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019 additionally there was an increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow 

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives

2019 compared to 2018 

energy generation and storage revenue decreased by 24 million or 2 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to decreases in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs partially offset increases in deployments of powerwall powerpack and megapack 

 

cost of revenues and gross margin 

 



 

automotive  services and other segment

cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand 

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs

costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services  costs to acquire and certify used vehicles costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers

 

201 9 compared to 201 8 

cost of automotive sales revenue increased 225 billion or 16 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to an increase of 137969 model 3 cash deliveries and higher average model s and model x costs per unit compared to the prior year due to the discontinuation of lower end trims in 2019 the increases were partially offset by a decrease of 30487 model s and model x cash deliveries and a decrease in average model 3 costs per unit compared to the prior year primarily due to lower end trims introduced in 2019 and temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 additionally due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019 we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments if customers elect to exercise the buyback options we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles which resulted in a reduction of automotive cost of sales of 451 million for the year ended december 31 2019 refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased 29 million or 6 in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases the decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program partially due to the introduction of model 3 leasing in the second quarter of 2019 

cost of services and other revenue increased 890 million or 47 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to the costs of used vehicle sales from the increased volumes of tradein vehicles additionally there were increases in the costs of our new service centers additional service personnel in existing and new service centers mobile service capabilities parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles 

gross margin for total automotive decreased from 23 to 21 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to lower model s and model x margins from lower selling prices due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019 a higher proportion of model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales compared to the prior period additionally the price adjustments also resulted in a reduction in gross automotive sales profit of 104 million from the adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program the decrease was partially offset by improvement of model 3 margins compared to the prior year as we achieved additional manufacturing efficiencies in the production of model 3 and an increase of 175 million in sales of regulatory credits

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment decreased from 19 to 17 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and a higher proportion of services and other within the segment which operates at lower gross margins than our automotive business 

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets in addition where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 

2019 compared to 2018 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue decreased by 24 million  or 2 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs partially offset by increases in deployments of powerwall powerpack and megapack

 

gross margin for energy generation and storage remained relatively consistent at 12 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  energy storage gross margins improved in the current year as a result of lower materials costs partially offset by lower gross margins in our cash and loan solar business driven by higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our solar r oof ramp 

research and development expense

 



 

research and development “rd” expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 7 to 5 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily from an increase in overall revenues from our expanding sales as well as from our focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business 

rd expenses decreased 117 million or 8 in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a 95 million decrease in employee and labor related expenses from cost efficiency initiatives and a 26 million decrease in professional and outside service expenses

selling general and administrative expense

 



 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements

sga expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 13 to 11 in year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily from an increase in overall revenues from our expanding sales as well as from our focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business 

sga expenses decreased 189 million or 7 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a 302 million decrease in employee and labor related expenses from decreased headcount and cost efficiency initiatives partially offset by a 112 million increase in stockbased compensation expense the increase in stockbased compensation expense was primarily related to the 2018 ceo performance award as we recorded a 72 million cumulative catchup expense for the service provided from the grant date when an additional operational milestone was considered probable of being met in the fourth quarter of 2019 additionally the expense period was shorter in the prior year as it commenced upon the grant approval date of march 21 2018

 

restructuring and other 

 



 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency as a result we recognized  50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses and losses from closing certain stores impacting both segments we recognized  47 million in impairment related to the iprd intangible asset as we abandoned further development efforts refer to note 4 goodwill and intangible assets for details and  15 million for the related equipment within the energy generation and storage segment we also incurred a loss of  37 million for closing operations in certain facilities on the statement of cash flows the amounts were presented in the captions in which such amounts would have been recorded absent the impairment charges the employee termination expenses were substantially paid by december 31 2019 while the remaining amounts were noncash

during the year ended december 31 2018 we carriedout certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency and recognized  37 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from subleasing a certain facility the employee termination cash expenses of  27 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018 while the remaining amounts were noncash also included within restructuring and other activities was  55 million of expenses materially all of which were noncash from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty in addition we concluded that a small portion of the iprd asset is not commercially feasible consequently we recognized an impairment loss of  13 million we recognized settlement and legal expenses of  30 million in the year ended december 31 2018 for the settlement with the sec relating to a takeprivate proposal for tesla these expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018  

interest expense

 



 

interest expense increased by 22 million or 3 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness at relatively consistent weighted average interest rates as compared to the year ended december 31 2018

other income expense net

 



 

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates

 

other income expense net increased   by 23 million  or 105 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the change was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  offset by losses from interest rate swaps related to our debt facilities yearoveryear 

provision for income taxes

 



 

our provision for income taxes increased by 52 million or 90 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to the increase in taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions yearoveryear

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

 



 

our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests changed unfavorably by 174 million in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the change was primarily due to lower activities in our financing fund arrangements

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2019 we had 627 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 126 billion and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euros and canadian dollars our sources of cash are predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings

our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products establishment andor increases of model 3 and model y production capacity at the fremont factory and at gigafactory shanghai the continued expansion of gigafactory nevada the construction of gigafactory berlin the manufacturing ramp of the solar roof at gigafactory new york and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network 

as discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—management opportunities challenges and risks and 2020 outlook—trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses in this annual report on form 10k considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramps for our products construction and expansion of our factories and pipeline of projects under development and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture battery cells as well as considering all other infrastructure growth we currently expect our average annual capital expenditures in 2020 and the two succeeding fiscal years to be 25 billion to 35 billion

 

we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our nearterm debt obligations although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources for example we expect that much of our investment in gigafactory shanghai will continue to be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in china such as the rmb 90 billion or the equivalent amount in us dollars fixed asset term facility and rmb 225 billion or the equivalent amount in us dollars working capital revolving facility that our local subsidiary entered into in december 2019 and we expect the same with respect to gigafactory berlin  as always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business  to further strengthen our balance sheet or for general corporate purposes  

we have an agreement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following full production at gigafactory new york we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the state of new york and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network we may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

in addition we had 303 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of december 31 2019 some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts our interests in financing funds or various other assets and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds upon the drawdown of any unused committed amounts there are no restrictions on use of available funds for general corporate purposes for details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to note 12 debt  and note 17 variable interest entity arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

summary of cash flows

 



 

cash flows from operating activities

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicles in transit our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales customer lease payments customer deposits cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process operating expenses operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 307 million to  241   billion during the year ended december 31 2019 from 210 billion during the year ended december 31 2018 this favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of  902 million partially offset by the increase in net operating assets and liabilities of 407 million and 188 million of the repayment of our 025 convertible senior notes due in 2019 which was classified as an operating activity as this represented an interest payment on the discounted convertible notes the increase in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2019 as compared to 2018 as we were ramping for model 3 production in 2018 and a larger increase in operating lease vehicles in 2019 as compared to 2018 as we began offering model 3 leasing in 2019 the increase in net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in inventory and a larger increase in deferred revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 

cash flows from investing activities

cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 133 billion during 2019 mainly for gigafactory shanghai construction model 3 production and model y preparations and 210 billion during 2018 mainly for model 3 production design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems amounted to 105 million and 218 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

  cash flows from financing activities

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2018 consisted primarily of 118 billion of net borrowings under automobile assetbacked notes 431 million of net borrowings under the senior secured assetbased revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” 334 million from the issuance of solar assetbacked notes and 296 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances these cash inflows were partially offset by net repayments of 582 million under our vehicle leasebacked loan and security agreements the “warehouse agreements” collateralized lease repayments of 559 million repayments of 230 million of the 275 convertible senior notes due on november 1 2018 and repayments of 210 million under the revolving aggregation credit facility

 

contractual obligations 

we are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties including certain debt financing arrangements and leases primarily for stores service centers certain manufacturing and corporate offices these also include as part of our normal business practices contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts the following table sets forth as of december 31 2019 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity in millions

 

 



 





the table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of 247 million because if recognized they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase and finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners and certain leasing partners refer to automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the maximum amount we could be required to pay under these programs should customers exercise their resale value guarantees or buyback options would be 170 billion over the next five years of which 226 million is within a 12month period from december 31 2019 we have not included this in the table above as it is unknown how many customers will exercise their options additionally we plan to resell any vehicles which are returned to us and therefore the actual exposure to us is deemed to be limited

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which were established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

foreign currency risk

we transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro japanese yen canadian dollar chinese yuan and norwegian krone in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar for our foreign subsidiaries accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income loss as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances for the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized a net foreign currency gain of 48 million in other expense income net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the us dollar british pound and canadian dollar as our subsidiaries are denominated in various local currencies for the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized a net foreign currency gain of 2 million in other expense income  net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the euro new taiwan dollar and canadian dollar 

we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm these changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income loss before income taxes these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of 362 million at december 31 2019 and 176 million at december 31 2018 assuming no foreign currency hedging

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes a hypothetical 10 change in our interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 by 8 million and 9 million respectively

overview 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles “evs” and energy generation and storage systems and also install and maintain such energy systems and sell solar electricity we are the world’s first vertically integrated sustainable energy company offering endtoend clean energy products including generation storage and consumption we have established and continue to grow a global network of stores galleries vehicle service centers mobile service technicians body shops supercharger stations and destination chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products and we continue to develop selfdriving capability in order to improve vehicle safety our sustainable energy products engineering expertise intense focus to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and business model differentiate us from other companies 

we currently produce and sell three fully electric vehicles the model s sedan the model x sport utility vehicle “suv” and the model 3 sedan all of our vehicles offer high performance and functionality as well as attractive styling 

we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 and have continued to improve model s by introducing performance allwheel drive dual motor and autopilot options as well as free overtheair software updates we commenced deliveries of model x in september 2015 model x offers seating for up to seven people allwheel drive and our autopilot functionality we commenced deliveries of model 3 a lowerpriced sedan designed for the mass market in july 2017 and we have significantly ramped its production we are now embarking on the delivery of model 3 in international markets and are focusing on lowering manufacturing costs while continuing to increase its production rate

we also intend to bring additional allelectric vehicles to market in the future including model y the tesla semi truck a pickup truck and a new version of the tesla roadster  the production of fully electric vehicles that meet consumers’ range and performance expectations requires substantial design engineering and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles our design and vehicle engineering capabilities combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system have enabled us to design and develop electric vehicles that we believe overcome the design styling and performance issues that have historically limited broad adoption of electric vehicles as a result our customers enjoy several benefits including







we sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network which we are continuing to grow globally the benefits we receive from distribution ownership enable us to improve the overall customer experience the speed of product development and the capital efficiency of our business we are also continuing to build our network of superchargers and destination chargers in north america europe and asia to provide alternative convenient options for fast charging

 

in addition we are leveraging our technological expertise in batteries power electronics and integrated systems to manufacture and sell energy storage products in late 2016 we began production and deliveries of our latest generation energy storage products powerwall 2 and powerpack 2 powerwall 2 is a 14 kilowatt hour “kwh” home battery with an integrated inverter powerpack 2 is an infinitely scalable energy storage system for commercial industrial and utility applications comprised of up to 210 kwh ac battery packs and up to 650 kva at 480v inverters similar to our electric vehicles our energy storage products have been developed to receive overtheair firmware and software updates that enable additional features over time 

finally we sell and lease solar energy systems with or without accompanying energy storage systems to residential and commercial customers and sell renewable energy to residential and commercial customers at prices that are typically below utility rates since 2006 we have installed solar energy systems for hundreds of thousands of customers however the electricity produced by our solar installations represents a very small fraction of total us electricity generation with tens of millions of singlefamily homes and businesses in our primary service territories and many more in other locations we have a large opportunity to expand and grow this business we believe that residential solar energy generation is gaining momentum as exemplified in part by the state of california recently requiring that new homes be built with solar generation starting in 2020 we also intend to ramp production of our innovative solar roof product

we manufacture our vehicle products primarily at our facilities in fremont california lathrop california tilburg netherlands and at our gigafactory 1 near reno nevada we manufacture our energy storage products at gigafactory 1 and tesla solar products at our us facilities including in buffalo new york gigafactory 2 in january 2019 we began construction of our gigafactory shanghai in china where we intend to commence production of certain trims of model 3 for the local market by the end of 2019

in addition to our volumeproduced consumer evs including future vehicles such as model y and a pickup truck we are planning to introduce additional types of vehicles to address a broader crosssection of the vehicle market including commercial evs such as the tesla semi truck and a new version of the tesla roadster we have started to accept reservations for the tesla semi truck and the new tesla roadster

energy storage

using the energy management technologies and manufacturing processes developed for our vehicle powertrain systems we developed energy storage products for use in homes commercial facilities and on the utility grid advances in battery architecture thermal management and power electronics that were originally commercialized in our vehicles are now being leveraged in our energy storage products our energy storage systems are used for numerous applications including backup power grid independence peak demand reduction demand response reducing intermittency of renewable generation replacement of fossil fuel generation and wholesale electric market services 

our energy product portfolio includes systems with a wide range of applications from residential to large gridscale projects powerwall 2 is a 14 kwh rechargeable lithiumion battery designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility and can be used to provide seamless backup power in a grid outage and to maximize selfconsumption of solar power generation in addition we offer the powerpack 2 system a fully integrated energy storage solution comprised of up to 210kwh ac battery packs and up to 650 kva at 480v inverters that can be grouped together to form megawatt hour “mwh” and gigawatt hour “gwh” sized installations the powerpack 2 system can be used by commercial and industrial customers for peak shaving load shifting selfconsumption of solar generation and demand response as well as to provide backup power during grid outages and by utilities and independent power producers to smooth and firm the output of renewable power generation sources provide dynamic energy capacity to the grid defer or eliminate the need to upgrade transmission or distribution infrastructure and provide a variety of other grid services such as frequency regulation and voltage control powerpack 2 can also be combined with renewable energy generation sources to create microgrids that provide communities with clean resilient and affordable power

along with designing and manufacturing energy storage products we continue to develop and advance our software capabilities for the control and optimal dispatch of energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications

solar energy systems

the major components of our solar energy systems include solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical current inverters that convert the electrical output from the panels to a usable current compatible with the electric grid racking that attaches the solar panels to the roof or ground electrical hardware that connects the solar energy system to the electric grid and our monitoring device while we have recently started manufacturing solar panels at gigafactory 2 in collaboration with panasonic we currently purchase the majority of system components from vendors maintaining multiple sources for each major component to ensure competitive pricing and an adequate supply of materials we also design and manufacture other system components

the residential solar energy systems that we sell enable our customers to take direct advantage of federal tax credits to reduce their electricity costs our solar loan offering enables customers to own their solar energy systems with little upfront cost we also continue to offer lease and power purchase agreement “ppa” options to both residential and commercial customers our current standard leases and ppas have a 20year term and we typically offer customers the opportunity to renew their agreements

in october 2016 we unveiled solar roof which integrates solar energy production with aesthetically pleasing and durable glass roofing tiles and is designed to complement the architecture of homes and commercial buildings while turning sunlight into electricity we have been installing this product at a slow pace to gather learnings about our design and installation processes and plan to ramp the production of solar roof with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019

 

technology 

vehicles

our core competencies are powertrain engineering vehicle engineering innovative manufacturing and energy storage our core intellectual property includes our electric powertrain our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain and our development of selfdriving technologies our powertrain consists of our battery pack power electronics motor gearbox and control software we offer several powertrain variants for our vehicles that incorporate years of research and development in addition we have designed our vehicles to incorporate the latest advances in consumer technologies such as mobile computing sensing displays and connectivity 

battery pack

we design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety reliability and long life our proprietary technology includes systems for high density energy storage cooling safety charge balancing structural durability and electronics management we have also pioneered advanced manufacturing techniques to manufacture large volumes of battery packs with high quality at low cost

we have significant expertise in the safety and management systems needed to use lithiumion cells in the automotive environment and have further optimized cell designs to increase overall performance these advancements have enabled us to improve over time the cost and performance of our batteries 

our engineering and manufacturing efforts have been performed with a longerterm goal of building a foundation for further development for instance we have designed our battery pack to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry and form factor we maintain extensive testing and rd capabilities at the individual cell level the full batterypack level and on other critical battery pack systems and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithiumion cell vendors chemistry types and performance characteristics we believe that the flexibility of our designs combined with our research and realworld performance data will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells and optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles

power electronics

the power electronics in our electric vehicle powertrain govern the flow of high voltage electrical current throughout our vehicles and serve to power our electric motor to generate torque while driving and deliver energy into the battery pack while charging

the drive inverter converts direct current from the battery pack into alternating current to drive our induction and permanent magnet motors and provides “regenerative braking” functionality which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack the primary technological advantages to our designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package with high efficiency and low cost

the charger charges the battery pack by converting alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this charger from a common household outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses 

dual motor powertrain

we offer dual motor powertrain vehicles which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an allwheel drive configuration tesla’s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels the nearinstantaneous response of the motors combined with low centers of gravity provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control

 

vehicle control and infotainment software 

the performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software there are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors software algorithms control traction vehicle stability the acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle climate control and thermal management and are also used extensively to monitor the charge state of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions we develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally

selfdriving development

we have expertise in developing selfdriving systems and currently offer in our vehicles an advanced driver assist system that we refer to as autopilot including autosteering traffic aware cruise control automated lane changing automated parking summon and driver warning systems in october 2016 we began equipping all tesla vehicles with hardware needed for full selfdriving capability including cameras that provide 360 degree visibility updated ultrasonic sensors for object detection a forwardfacing radar with enhanced processing and a powerful new onboard computer our autopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle our system provides safety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit this hardware suite along with overtheair firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard camera radar ultrasonics and gps enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance

additionally we continue to make significant advancements in the development of fully selfdriving technologies

energy storage

we are leveraging many of the componentlevel technologies from our vehicles to advance our energy storage products including high density energy storage cooling safety charge balancing structural durability and electronics management by taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems we are able to maximize manufacturing capacity to produce both powerwall and powerpack products additionally we are making significant strides in the area of bidirectional gridtied power electronics that enable us to interconnect our battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids while providing fastacting systems for power injection and absorption

solar energy systems

we are continually innovating and developing new technologies to facilitate the growth of our solar energy systems business for example solar roof is being designed to work seamlessly with tesla powerwall 2 and we have developed proprietary software to reduce system design and installation timelines and costs

design and engineering 

vehicles

in addition to the design development and production of the powertrain we have created significant inhouse capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems we design and engineer bodies chassis interiors heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems inhouse and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which reduces the product development time of new models

 

additionally our team has expertise in lightweight materials a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range model s and model x are built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporate a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle moreover we have designed model 3 with a mix of materials to be lightweight and safe while also increasing costeffectiveness for this massmarket vehicle we are designing model y on the model 3 platform and expect that model y will share about 75 of its components with model 3 which we expect will reduce the cost and time to ramp production of model y 

energy storage

we have an inhouse engineering team that both designs our energy storage products themselves and works with our residential commercial and utility customers to design bespoke systems incorporating our products our team’s expertise in electrical mechanical civil and software engineering enables us to create integrated energy storage solutions that meet the particular needs of all customer types

manufacturing 

vehicles

we conduct vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at our facilities in fremont california lathrop california and tilburg netherlands we have also built and continue to expand gigafactory 1 a manufacturing facility for battery cells modules packs and storage products and vehicle components outside of reno nevada we are also constructing gigafactory shanghai a manufacturing facility in china for the production of model 3 vehicles for the local market

manufacturing facilities in fremont ca and lathrop ca

we manufacture our vehicles and certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards at our manufacturing facilities in fremont ca including the tesla factory and our manufacturing facility in lathrop ca our fremont facilities contain several manufacturing operations including stamping machining casting plastics body assembly paint operations drive unit production seat assembly final vehicle assembly and endofline testing in addition we manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors gearboxes and components for model s and model x at the tesla factory some major vehicle component systems are purchased from suppliers however we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at the tesla factory 

the netherlands

our european headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in amsterdam and tilburg our operations in tilburg include final assembly testing and quality control for model s and model x vehicles delivered within the european union a parts distribution warehouse for service centers throughout europe a center for remanufacturing work and a customer service center

gigafactory 1 outside of reno nevada

gigafactory 1 is a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery material cell module and battery pack production in one location we use the battery packs manufactured at gigafactory 1 for our vehicles including model 3 and energy storage products we also manufacture model 3 drive units at gigafactory 1

 

gigafactory 1 is being built in phases tesla panasonic and other partners are currently manufacturing inside the finished sections our present plan is to continue expanding gigafactory 1 over the next few years so that its capacity significantly exceeds the approximately 500000 vehicle per year capacity that we announced when we first started developing it and we have additionally added capacity for manufacturing our energy storage products we have also announced that we will likely manufacture model y which we intend to produce at high volumes by the end of 2020 at gigafactory 1 

we believe that gigafactory 1 will allow us to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs with our volume production of model 3 we have an agreement with panasonic to partner with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it is using to manufacture and supply us with battery cells through our ownership of gigafactory 1 and our partnership with panasonic we own sole access to a facility designed to be the highestvolume and lowestcost source of lithiumion batteries in the world

gigafactory shanghai

we are constructing gigafactory shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of model 3 for customers in china by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the us we broke ground in january 2019 and subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online we expect to begin production of certain trims of model 3 at gigafactory shanghai by the end of 2019 we expect much of the investment in gigafactory shanghai to be provided through local debt financing supported by limited direct capital expenditures by us moreover we are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory to be less than that of our model 3 production at the tesla factory from which we have drawn learnings that should allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout and processes at gigafactory shanghai

supply chain

our vehicles use thousands of purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of suppliers we have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts while we obtain components from multiple sources in some cases similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source in addition while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have currently fully qualified only one cell supplier for the battery packs we use in our production vehicles we are working to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers

we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials we believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements

energy storage

our energy storage products are manufactured at gigafactory 1 we leverage the same supply chain process and infrastructure as we use for our vehicles the battery architecture and many of the components used in our energy storage products are the same or similar to those used in our vehicles’ battery pack enabling us to take advantage of manufacturing efficiencies and supply chain economies of scale the power electronics and inverters for the powerwall and powerpack systems are also manufactured at gigafactory 1 allowing us to ship deploymentready systems directly to customers

 

solar energy systems 

we currently purchase major components such as solar panels and inverters directly from multiple manufacturers we typically purchase solar panels and inverters on an asneeded basis from our suppliers at thenprevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued under our master contractual arrangements in december 2016 we entered into a longterm agreement with panasonic to manufacture photovoltaic “pv” cells and modules with negotiated pricing provisions at our gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york with the intended capacity to manufacture at least 10 gigawatt “gw” of solar products annually we have recently started manufacturing solar panels at this facility in collaboration with panasonic

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

vehicles

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives

we have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority “caeatfa” that provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of model s model x model 3 and future electric vehicles and the expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in california 

nevada tax incentives

in connection with the construction of gigafactory 1 we have entered into agreements with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that provide abatements for sales use real property personal property and employer excise taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits these incentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on october 17 2014 and ending on either june 30 2024 or june 30 2034 depending on the incentive under these agreements we were eligible for a maximum of 1950 million of transferable tax credits subject to capital investments by us and our partners for gigafactory 1 of at least 350 billion which we exceeded during 2017 and specified hiring targets for gigafactory 1 which we exceeded during 2018 as a result as of december 31 2018 we had earned the maximum amount of credits

tesla regulatory credits

in connection with the production delivery placement into service and ongoing operation of our zero emission vehicles charging infrastructure and solar systems in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits we have sold these credits and will continue to sell future credits to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements for example under california’s zero emission vehicle regulation and those of states that have adopted california’s standard vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits referred to as zev credits for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements these laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws tesla also earns other types of salable regulatory credits in the united states and abroad including greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuels credits likewise several us states have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production these requirements enable companies deploying solar energy to earn tradable credits known as solar renewable energy certificates “srecs”

regulation—vehicle safety and testing

our vehicles are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards “fmvss” our vehicles fully comply with all applicable fmvsss without the need for any exemptions and we expect future tesla vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies additionally there are regulatory changes being considered for several fmvss and while we anticipate compliance there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted

 

as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable fmvss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the us numerous fmvss apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements we are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by nhtsa including the cafe standards theft prevention act requirements consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements 

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted

our vehicles sold outside of the us are subject to similar foreign safety environmental and other regulations many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the us and may require redesign andor retesting the european union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that are scheduled to commence in 2020 and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the united kingdom’s impending withdrawal from the european union these changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in europe

regulation – self driving

there are no federal us regulations pertaining to the safety of selfdriving vehicles however nhtsa has established recommended guidelines certain us states have legal restrictions on selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them this patchwork increases the legal complexity for our vehicles in europe certain vehicle safety regulations apply to selfdriving braking and steering systems and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of selfdriving vehicles selfdriving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the us and foreign countries and may create restrictions on selfdriving features that we develop

regulation—battery safety and testing

our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation the regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation such as by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations

we use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs the use storage and disposal of our battery packs is regulated under federal law we have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation

state laws regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state as we open additional tesla stores and service centers we secure dealer licenses or their equivalent and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers a few states such as michigan and connecticut do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet phone or mail in such states we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and are not sales locations

as we expand our retail footprint in the us some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations we expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model in addition we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations and we intend to actively fight any such efforts to limit our ability to sell our own vehicles

 

energy storage 

the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development nevertheless there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage for example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 30 tax credit under section 48a3 of the internal revenue code or the irc as described below in addition california and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program

the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets in 2011 and 2013 ferc removed many barriers for systems like energy storage to provide frequency regulation service thus increasing the value these systems can obtain in wholesale energy markets more recently in late 2016 ferc released a notice of proposed rulemaking that if it becomes a final rule would further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets finally in january 2017 ferc issued a statement supporting the use of energy storage as both electric transmission and as electric generation concurrently thus enabling energy storage systems to provide greater value to the electric grid

solar energy systems

government and utility programs and incentives

us federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates

the federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit “itc” under two sections of the irc section 48 and section 25d section 48a3 of the irc allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar energy system that commences construction by december 31 2019 the credit then declines to 26 in 2020 22 in 2021 and a permanent 10 thereafter we claim the section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial projects based on ownership of the solar energy system the federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy systems section 25d of the irc allows a homeownertaxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by december 31 2019 the credit then declines to 26 in 2020 and 22 in 2021 and is scheduled to expire thereafter customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash or through our solar loan offering are eligible to claim the section 25d investment tax credit

in addition to the federal itc many us states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentives for solar energy systems

regulation – general

we are not a “regulated utility” in the us to operate our systems we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities in most cases interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been preapproved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body 

sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases and ppas face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions

regulation – net metering

most states in the us have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their onsite solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so

 

regulation – mandated renewable capacity 

many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production such as an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or rps or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources such as solar energy systems in srec state markets the rps requires electricity suppliers to secure a portion of their electricity from solar generators the srec program provides a means for srecs to be created a srec represents the renewable energy associated with 1000 kwhs of electricity produced from a solar energy system when a solar energy system generates 1000 kwhs of electricity one srec is issued by a government agency which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entities who surrender the srecs to the state to prove compliance with the state’s renewable energy mandate

competition 

vehicles

the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader crosssection of the passenger and commercial vehicle market

we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology for example model s and model x compete primarily with premium sedans and premium suvs and model 3 competes with small to mediumsized sedans which are extremely competitive markets with internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers 

moreover many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the us market as well in addition several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles including plugin versions 

energy storage

the market for energy storage products is also highly competitive established companies such as aes energy storage siemens lg chem and samsung as well as various emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio there are several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems such as cells battery modules and power electronics as well as others providing integrated systems we compete with these companies based on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specifications of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our powerpack 2 product give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products

solar energy systems

the primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers we compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems we also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations in the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitors include vivint solar inc sunrun inc trinity solar sunpower corporation and many smaller local solar companies

 

intellectual property 

as part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements additionally we previously announced a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world

segment information 

we operate as two reportable segments automotive and energy generation and storage

the automotive segment includes the design development manufacturing sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits additionally the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other which includes nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers the energy generation and storage segment includes the design manufacture installation and sale or leasing of stationary energy storage products and solar energy systems and sale of electricity generated by our solar energy systems to customers

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business and industry

we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays or other complications in the design manufacture launch production delivery and servicing ramp of new vehicles and other products such as model 3 model y our energy storage products and solar roof which could harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

we have previously experienced launch manufacturing production and delivery ramp delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models such as model s model x and model 3 new vehicle features such as the allwheel drive dual motor drivetrain on model s and the second version of autopilot hardware and a significant increase in automation introduced in the manufacture of model 3 for example we encountered unanticipated challenges such as certain supply chain constraints that led to initial delays in producing model x similarly we experienced certain challenges in the production of model 3 that led to delays in its ramp moreover in the areas of model 3 production where we had challenges ramping fully automated processes such as portions of the battery module assembly line material flow system and the general assembly line we reduced the levels of automation and introduced semiautomated or manual processes if issues like these arise or recur if our remediation measures and process changes do not continue to be successful if we experience issues with transitioning to full automation in certain production lines or to other planned manufacturing improvements or if we experience issues or delays in building our gigafactory shanghai in china or commencing and ramping model 3 production there we could experience issues in sustaining the model 3 ramp or delays in increasing model 3 production further also if we encounter difficulties in scaling our delivery or servicing capabilities for model 3 or future vehicles and products to high volumes in the us or internationally our financial condition and operating results could suffer in addition because our vehicle models share certain production facilities with other vehicle models the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other models or lead to bottlenecks that impact the production of all models

we may also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles such as model y the tesla semi our planned pickup truck and new tesla roadster our energy storage products and solar roof any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of and delivery capabilities for our current products or the development manufacture launch production and delivery and servicing capability ramp of our future products including complications associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain and delivery systems or obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays in realizing our projected timelines and cost and volume targets for the production and ramp of model 3  which could harm our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results

our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to manufacture market and sell the model 3 vehicle which we are offering at a lower price point and which we are producing at significantly higher volumes than the model s or model x vehicles we commenced production and initial customer deliveries of model 3 in july 2017 and since then have achieved a stabilized production rate at the tesla factory we expect to continue to increase our model 3 production rate to approximately 7000 units per week on a sustained basis by the end of 2019 moreover in china we expect to commence production of certain trims of model 3 for the local market in china in the initial phase of our gigafactory shanghai by the end of 2019 and then progressively increase levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing inclusive of gigafactory shanghai our goal is to be able to produce 10000 model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis and an annualized output rate in excess of 500000 model 3 vehicles sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 however the timeframe for commencing model 3 production at gigafactory shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online

 

we have limited experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we recently achieved and to which we anticipate ramping further for model 3 and to be successful we will need to complete the implementation and ramp of efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains necessary to support such volumes including at gigafactory shanghai we are employing a higher degree of automation in the manufacturing processes for model 3 than we have previously employed and to continue to implement additional automation in some cases we have temporarily reduced the levels of automation and introduced semiautomated or manual processes  at additional labor cost additional bottlenecks may also arise as we continue to ramp production at the tesla factory and commence the initial phase of model 3 production at gigafactory shanghai and it will be important that we address them promptly and in a costeffective manner  moreover our model 3 production plan has generally required to date significant investments of cash and management resources and we expect to deploy some level of additional resources as we further progress our ramp and begin production in new locations in the future such as china 

our production plan for model 3 is based on many key assumptions including













if one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect our ability to meet our model 3 projections on time and at volumes and prices that are profitable the demand for and deliveries of model 3 as well as our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 

we may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production sales and delivery plans and servicing needs any of which could harm our business and prospects

our plans call for sustaining and further ramping from our significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries particularly for model 3 our ability to achieve these plans will depend upon a number of factors including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity to achieve the planned production yield further install and increase capacity in accordance with our planned timelines and costs maintain our desired quality levels and optimize design and production changes as well as our suppliers’ ability to support our needs in addition we have used and may use in the future a number of new manufacturing technologies techniques and processes for our vehicles which we must successfully introduce and scale for highvolume production for example we have introduced highly automated production lines aluminum spot welding systems and highspeed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts we have also introduced unique design features in our vehicles with different manufacturing challenges such as large display screens dual motor drivetrain autopilot hardware and falconwing doors we have limited experience developing manufacturing selling and servicing and allocating our available resources among multiple products simultaneously if we are unable to realize our plans our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially damaged

 

concurrent with our increasing vehicle production levels we will also need to continue to significantly increase sales and deliveries of our vehicles although we have a plan for selling and delivering increased volumes of vehicles we have limited experience in marketing selling and delivering vehicles at the higher volumes at which we are manufacturing model 3 and we may face difficulties meeting our sales and delivery goals in both existing markets as well as new markets into which we expand such as europe and china where we are beginning to deliver model 3 for the first time in the first quarter of 2019 in particular we are targeting for the first time with model 3 a mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers in which we have limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products while we are producing numerous variants including regional versions of model 3 in accordance with the demand that we expect for them if our projections are inaccurate we may not be able to generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have the capacity to produce based on vehicle production line constraints and long lead times for procuring certain parts 

moreover because we do not have independent dealer networks we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers and meeting their vehicle servicing needs to date we have limited experience with such deliveries and servicing at the scale to which we expect to grow particularly in international markets to accommodate our volumes we have deployed a number of delivery models such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces some of which have not been previously tested at scale and in different geographies moreover significant transit time may be required to transport vehicles such as model 3 in volume into new markets for the first time to the extent that such factors lead to delays in our deliveries our results may be negatively impacted finally because of our unique expertise with our vehicles we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by our service centers mobile service technicians or certain authorized professionals that we have specifically trained and equipped if we experience delays in adding such servicing capacity or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of model 3 which we recently commenced producing at volume it could overburden our servicing capabilities if we are unable to ramp up to meet our sales delivery and servicing targets globally or our projections on which such targets are based are inaccurate this could result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with model 3

our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular although we have successfully grown demand for our vehicles thus far there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicles will not compete with one another in the market moreover the model 3 mass market demographic is larger but more competitive than the demographic for model s and model x and additional electric vehicles are entering the market 

if the market for electric vehicles in general and tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be harmed we have only recently begun high volume production of vehicles are still at an earlier stage and have limited resources relative to our competitors and the market for alternative fuel vehicles is rapidly evolving as a result the market for our vehicles could be affected by numerous factors such as 















 

we are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are singlesource suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products according to our schedule and at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers the majority of whom are currently singlesource suppliers although we attempt to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible any significant increases in our production may require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time and in the past we have also replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our products moreover we have signed longterm agreements with panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier for lithiumion cells at gigafactory 1 in nevada and pv cells and panels at gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york if we encounter unexpected difficulties with key suppliers such as panasonic and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers we could experience production delays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing servicing and supporting our products

this limited and in many cases single source supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our products such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slowerthanplanned model s and model x ramps furthermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars governmental changes natural disasters such as the march 2011 earthquakes in japan and other factors beyond our and our suppliers’ control could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to product design changes and delays in product deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

changes in our supply chain have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost we have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to our design changes and we may experience similar cost increases in the future certain suppliers have sought to renegotiate the terms of supply arrangements additionally we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer 

in particular because we are producing model 3 at significantly higher volumes than any of our other products to date the negative impact of any delays or other constraints with respect to our suppliers for model 3 could be substantially greater than any supply chainrelated issues experienced with respect to our other products we need our model 3 suppliers to sustainably ramp in accordance with our ongoing ramp of model 3 and deliver according to our schedule there is no assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to sustainably and timely meet our cost quality and volume needs for example we may experience issues or delays increasing the level of localization in china through local sourcing and manufacturing at our gigafactory shanghai furthermore as the scale of our vehicle production increases we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities components at much higher volumes if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

 

future problems or delays in expanding gigafactory 1 or ramping operations there could negatively affect the production and profitability of our products such as model 3 and our energy storage products 

to lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume we have vertically integrated the production of lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for model 3 and energy storage products at gigafactory 1 while gigafactory 1 began producing lithiumion cells for energy storage products in january 2017 and has since begun producing lithiumion cells for model 3 we have no other direct experience in the production of lithiumion cells given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in issues or delays in further ramping and expanding production at gigafactory 1 moreover we expect that we will need additional production at gigafactory 1 to support vehicle production at gigafactory shanghai in part when we commence model 3 production there in order to achieve our volume and gross margin targets for model 3 and the anticipated ramp in production of energy storage products we must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at gigafactory 1 which among other things requires panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp its cell production lines at significant volumes although panasonic has a long track record of producing highquality cells at significant volume at its factories in japan it has limited experience with cell production at gigafactory 1 in addition we produce several components for model 3 such as battery modules incorporating the lithiumion cells produced by panasonic and drive units at gigafactory 1 some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity while we have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying multiple semiautomated lines and improving our original lines additional bottlenecks may arise as we continue to increase the production rate finally we have announced that we will likely manufacture model y at gigafactory 1 if we are unable to maintain gigafactory 1 production ramp additionally over time as needed and do so costeffectively or if we or panasonic are unable to attract hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel our ability to supply battery packs or other components for model 3 and our other products could be negatively impacted which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

if our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed

if our vehicles or our energy products contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as full selfdriving take longer than expected to become enabled or are legally restricted our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks issues experienced by vehicle customers have included those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12volt battery in the model s and the seats and doors in the model x although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not be to the satisfaction of our customers while we have performed extensive internal testing on the products we manufacture we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs powertrains vehicles and energy storage products there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for consumers 

any product defects delays or legal restrictions on product features or other failure of our products to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays product recalls product liability claims and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

 

if we fail to scale our business operations and otherwise manage future growth and adapt to new conditions effectively as we rapidly grow our company including internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our products successfully 

any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we expect to continue to expand our operations significantly including internationally and with our increasing production of model 3 and the worldwide sales delivery and servicing of a significantly higher number of vehicles than our current vehicle fleet in the coming years furthermore we are developing and growing our energy storage product and solar business worldwide including in countries where we have limited or no previous operating experience our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully we may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to control expenses and avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs establish sufficient worldwide automobile sales delivery service and supercharger facilities in a timely manner adapt our products and conduct our operations to meet local requirements implement required local infrastructure systems and processes and find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing engineering service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel

in particular we plan to expand our manufacturing capabilities outside of the us where we have limited experience operating a factory or managing related regulatory financing and other challenges for example as part of our continuing work to increase model 3 production to 10000 vehicles per week on a sustained basis and make model 3 affordable in the markets where we plan to offer it we expect to commence the initial phase of model 3 production at gigafactory shanghai for the local market in china by the end of 2019 although the timeframe for that is subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online as we expect to commence our manufacturing activities in china using progressively increased levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing we expect that we will need to initially support manufacturing activities there with production processes at our existing manufacturing facilities such as gigafactory 1 moreover local manufacturing is critical to our expansion and sales in china which is the largest market for electric vehicles in the world our sales of model s and model x in china have been negatively impacted by certain tariffs on automobiles manufactured in the us such as our vehicles and our costs for producing our vehicles in the us have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced from china if we are not able to establish manufacturing activities in china and other jurisdictions to minimize the impact of such unfavorable tariffs duties or costs or ramp our production capabilities at gigafactory 1 or other facilities to support such vehicle manufacturing activities our ability to compete in such jurisdictions and our operating results business and prospects will be harmed 

if we are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing costs for our vehicles including model 3 our financial condition and operating results will suffer 

while we are continuing to and expect in the future to realize cost reductions by both us and our suppliers there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals including for the least expensive variant of model 3 that we ultimately expect to produce or our other financial targets we incur significant costs related to procuring the materials required to manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel if our efforts to continue to decrease manufacturing costs are not successful we may incur substantial costs or cost overruns in utilizing and increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facilities such as for model 3 both in the us and internationally many of the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control such as potential increases in the costs of our materials and components such as lithium nickel and other components of our battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels if we are unable to continue to control and reduce our manufacturing costs our operating results business and prospects will be harmed 

 

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of materials in particular for lithiumion cells could harm our business 

we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various materials in our business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers the prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased production of electric vehicles and energy storage products by our competitors and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells these risks include







our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage products while we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells manufactured at our own facilities we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for energy products until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs substantial increases in the prices for our materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by battery cell suppliers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims

although we design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road product liability claims even those without merit could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected as is true for other automakers our cars have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury and such crashes where autopilot is engaged are the subject of significant public attention we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of new technologies that we are pioneering including autopilot in our vehicles moreover as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause injury to people or property a successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicles and energy storage products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results in most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds not by insurance 

 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industries we currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from companies with new technology 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future there is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete a significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and applications in some cases such competitors have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sales resources and networks than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products in particular some competitors have also announced plans to compete with us in important and large markets for electric vehicles such as china increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition our model 3 vehicle faces competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes

the solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive we face competition from other manufacturers developers and installers of solar and energy storage systems as well as from large utilities decreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and ppas moreover solar panel and lithiumion battery prices have declined and are continuing to decline as we increase our battery and solar manufacturing capabilities including at gigafactory 1 and gigafactory 2 future price declines may harm our ability to produce energy storage systems and solar systems at competitive prices

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industries then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially

consumers may be less likely to purchase our products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operations will continue in the long term similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts ratings agencies and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors such as our limited operating history negative press customer unfamiliarity with our products any delays in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operations to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations and any other negative publicity related to us many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team could harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed

 

our plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by expanding and optimizing our retail service and vehicle charging operations will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to additional sales installations or servicing of our products or availability of public charging solutions 

we plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by globally expanding and optimizing our retail service and vehicle charging operations these plans require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales or installations of our products this ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry into markets in which we have limited or no experience selling delivering installing andor servicing our products at scale and which may pose legal regulatory labor cultural and political challenges that we have not previously encountered may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and installations and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore the increasing number of tesla vehicles will require us to continue to increase the number of our supercharger stations and connectors significantly in locations throughout the world if we fail to do so in a timely manner our customers could become dissatisfied which could adversely affect sales of our vehicles we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale installation and service of our products the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of superchargers in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delays or cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our customer infrastructure network or our expansion plans are not successful in continuing to grow demand this could lead to a decrease or stagnation in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we face risks associated with our global operations and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political economic tax and labor conditions and with establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business

we currently have a global footprint with domestic and international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions and we continue to expand and optimize our retail service and supercharger capabilities internationally accordingly we are subject to a variety of legal political and regulatory requirements and social and economic conditions over which we have little control for example we may be impacted by trade policies political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies

we are subject to a number of risks associated in particular with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention these risks include conforming our products to various international regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures organizing local operating entities difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations challenges in attracting customers foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements our ability to enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products for example in china which is a key market for us certain products such as automobiles manufactured in the us have become subject to a recently increased tariff imposed by the government while such increase has been temporarily suspended the tariff could remain in place for an undetermined length of time be further increased in the future andor lead consumers to postpone or choose another vehicle brand subject to lower tariffs or no tariffs moreover recently increased import duties on certain components used in our products that are sourced from china may increase our costs and negatively impact our operating results 

 

 

our vehicles and energy storage products make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns and future events may lead to additional concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications 

the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or redesign efforts all of which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithiumion cells such as a vehicle or other fire even if such incident does not involve our vehicles or energy storage products could seriously harm our business

in addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our facilities and are producing high volumes of cells and battery modules and packs at gigafactory 1 any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall moreover any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

if we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing programs our business may suffer

we offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we also currently offer model s and model x leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the us and canada under a lease held directly by us we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease the profitability of any vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles the leasing program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk we expect the availability of leasing and other financing options will be important for our vehicle customers if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers we may be unable to grow our sales furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties either of which may harm our business

moreover we have provided resale value guarantees to customers and partners for certain financing programs under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined amounts however actual resale values as with residual values for leased vehicles are subject to similar fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements if the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the predetermined amounts we have offered our operating results profitability andor liquidity could be negatively impacted

 

 

the unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determinations with respect to government and economic incentives in the us and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles energy storage products or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our products and services 

we and our customers currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the us and abroad such incentives include among other things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes the 25 value added tax or the carbon dioxide and weightbased purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gaspowered vehicles notably the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gaspowered vehicles through the oil and gas industries nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example under current regulations a 7500 federal tax credit that was available in the us for the purchase of our vehicles is being reduced in phases during and will sunset at the end of 2019 we believe the first reduction in this tax credit may have pulled forward some nearterm demand in the us into 2018 and could create similar pullforwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit moreover in july 2018 a previously available incentive for purchases of model 3 in ontario canada was cancelled and tesla buyers in germany lost access to electric vehicle incentives for a short period of time beginning late 2017 in april 2017 and january 2016 respectively previously available incentives in hong kong and denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired negatively impacting sales effective march 2016 california implemented regulations phasing out a 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for highincome consumers such developments could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles and we and our customers may have to adjust to them

in addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our installation costs and cost of capital and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds however these incentives may expire on a particular date when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase often without warning for example the us federal government currently offers a 30 itc for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility the itc is currently scheduled to decline in phases ultimately to 10 for commercial and utility systems and to 0 for customerowned residential systems by january 2022 likewise in jurisdictions where net energy metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use several jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so such reductions in or termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results by making our products less competitive for potential customers increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets additionally the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act in the us could potentially increase the cost and decrease the availability of renewable energy financing by reducing the value of depreciation benefits associated with and the overall investor tax capacity needed to monetize renewable energy projects such changes could lower the overall investment willingness and capacity for such projects available in the market

moreover we and our fund investors claim the itc and certain state incentives in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar and energy storage systems although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower and they may do so again in the future such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors

 

any failure by us to realize the expected benefits of our substantial investments and commitments with respect to the manufacture of pv cells and modules including if we are unable to comply with the terms of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory 2 could result in negative consequences for our business 

we own certain pv cell and module manufacturing and technology assets and a buildtosuit lease arrangement with the research foundation for the state university of new york the “suny foundation” this agreement with the suny foundation provides for the construction of gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york with the intended capacity to produce at least 10 gw of solar products annually under this agreement we are obligated to among other things employ specified minimum numbers of personnel in the state of new york and spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following the completion of all construction and related infrastructure the arrival of manufacturing equipment and the receipt of certain permits and other specified items at gigafactory 2 if we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations we would be obligated to pay a “program payment” of 412 million to the suny foundation in such year any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts to the suny foundation the termination of our lease at gigafactory 2 andor the need to secure an alternative supply of pv cells and modules for our solar products moreover if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and technology assets in accordance with our expectations we may have to recognize accounting charges pertaining to the writeoff of such assets any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

if we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer and jeffrey b straubel our chief technology officer 

none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel especially to support our highvolume manufacture of vehicles and expansion plans and any failure or delay in doing so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

key talent may leave tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to us in california nevada and other regions where we have operations there is increasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineering manufacturing engineering and other skills such as electrical and building construction expertise this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones moreover we have in the past conducted reductions in force in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and certain senior personnel have also departed for various reasons our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner especially to support our expansion plans and to retain current employees or replace departed senior employees with qualified and experienced individuals which is typically a timeconsuming process additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones could have an adverse effect on our performance and results

 

finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins with an emphasis on equitybased awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the longterm interests of our stockholders each of our current equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan provides for an “evergreen” provision that permits our board of directors to increase on an annual basis subject to specified limits the number of equitybased awards that may be granted to and shares of our common stock that may be purchased by our personnel thereunder these plans are currently scheduled to expire in december 2019 and we will need to extend them or establish new plans in order to continue to compensate our employees following their expiration which will require the approval of our stockholders moreover there is no assurance that these plans as extended or any future plans will contain evergreen provisions which would mean that we would have to periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards that may be granted and shares that may be purchased under such plans if we are unable to obtain such stockholder approvals and compensate our personnel in accordance with our compensation philosophy our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel would be negatively impacted 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies corp a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures

we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed to protect our systems against breaches and cyberattacks if these efforts are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results and reputation could be harmed 

we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems to assist us in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the us and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems we also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft data breaches and other cyberattacks the implementation maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes these risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations 

we cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded as planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results moreover our proprietary information could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions

 

any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products and harm our business 

our products contain complex information technology systems for example our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our products and their systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks products and systems to gain control of or to change our products’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products we encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability accordingly we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be exploited in the future before they can be identified or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful

any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our products their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products their systems or data are capable of being “hacked” could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have been the subject of such reports in the past 

we are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities 

as a manufacturing company including with respect to facilities such as the tesla factory gigafactory   1 and gigafactory 2 we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the us and abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials the costs of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws may be significant we may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities which would hinder our operation of these facilities such costs and delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results furthermore any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties remediation costs third party damages or a suspension or cessation of our operations

our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities 

it is common for employees at companies with significant manufacturing operations such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the us mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory the united automobile workers “uaw” has been engaged in a campaign to organize manufacturing operations at tesla as part of that campaign the uaw has filed with the national labor relations board “nlrb” a series of unfair labor practice charges against tesla on which a hearing recently concluded we cannot predict the timing of the nlrb’s decision and an unfavorable outcome for tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of tesla’s treatment of our employees furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition

 

our products and services are subject to substantial regulations which are evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results 

motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of automobiles internationally for example in countries outside of the us we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emissions among other things that are often materially different from requirements in the us thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries this process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements

additionally our vehicles are equipped with a suite of driverassistance features called autopilot which help assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but require drivers to remain engaged there is a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and availability any of which could adversely affect our business

moreover as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by thirdparty owned systems for example existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit utilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with their solar energy systems charge fees and penalties to our customers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate designs such that the price of our solar products may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict us and our customers from transacting under our ppas or qualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering if such regulations and policies remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions or if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

failure to comply with various privacy and consumer protection laws to which we are subject could harm the company 

our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages and other costs substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws and in particular certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation and application for example in may 2018 the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the european union the gdpr has created new compliance obligations and has significantly increased fines for noncompliance although we take steps to protect the security of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand

 

we may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance 

any product recall with respect to our products may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition for example certain vehicle recalls that we initiated have resulted from various causes including a component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged a concern with the firmware in the restraints control module in certain righthanddrive vehicles industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier model x seat components that could cause unintended seat movement during a collision and concerns of corrosion in model s power steering assist motor bolts furthermore testing of our products by government regulators or industry groups may require us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that we have provided to other vehicle oems including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance 

subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system battery and drive unit we provide fouryear or 50000mile limited warranties for the purchasers of new model 3 model s and model x vehicles and either a fouryear or 50000mile limited warranty or a twoyear or 100000mile maximum odometer limited warranty for the purchasers of used model s or model x vehicles certified and sold by us the limited warranty for the battery and drive unit for new model s and model x vehicles covers the drive unit for eight years as well as the battery for a period of eight years or for certain older vehicles 125000 miles if reached sooner than eight years although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranties or extended service plans the limited warranty for used model s and model x vehicles does not extend or otherwise alter the terms of the original battery and drive unit limited warranty for such used vehicles specified in their original new vehicle limited warranty for the battery and drive unit on our current new model 3 vehicles we offer an eightyear or 100000mile limited warranty for our standard or midrange battery and an eightyear or 120000mile limited warranty for our longrange battery with minimum 70 retention of battery capacity over the warranty period in addition customers of new model s and model x vehicles have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicles to cover additional services for up to an additional four years or 50000 miles 

for energy storage products we provide limited warranties against defects and to guarantee minimum energy retention levels for example we currently guarantee that each powerwall 2 product will maintain at least 70 or 80 depending on the region of installation of its stated energy capacity after 10 years and that each powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in each of its first 15 years of use for our solar roof we currently offer a warranty on the glass tiles for the lifetime of a customer’s home and a separate warranty for the energy generation capability of the solar tiles we also offer extended warranties availability guarantees and capacity guarantees for periods of up to 20 years at an additional cost at the time of purchase as well as workmanship warranties to customers who elect to have us install their systems

finally customers who lease solar energy system leases or buy energy from us under ppas are covered by warranties equal to the length of the agreement term which is typically 20 years systems purchased for cash are covered by a workmanship warranty of up to 20 years in addition we pass through to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers’ warranties which generally range from 10 to 25 years finally we provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their lease under these performance guarantees we bear the risk of production shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel failure these risks are exacerbated in the event the panel or inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties

 

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserves include our management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as model 3 and solar roof that we have recently introduced andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future 

our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks

we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of god and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage as a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors

we expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities such as gigafactory shanghai may not be consistent or linear between periods additionally our revenues from periodtoperiod may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who may be focused only on quarterly financial results if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness

as of december 31 2018 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 1100 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note 13 longterm debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions we and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt

pursuant to their terms holders of our 025 convertible senior notes due 2019 125 convertible senior notes due 2021 and 2375 convertible senior notes due 2022 collectively the “tesla convertible notes” may convert their respective tesla convertible notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective tesla convertible notes under certain circumstances upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible notes we will be obligated to deliver cash andor shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such tesla convertible notes moreover our subsidiary’s 1625 convertible senior notes due 2019 and zerocoupon convertible senior notes due 2020 together the “subsidiary convertible notes” are convertible into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from 30000 to 75936 per share finally holders of the tesla convertible notes and the subsidiary convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date

 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire  depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

the terms of certain of our credit facilities including our senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt in addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio as a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it 

we may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them  our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

the design manufacture sale installation andor servicing of automobiles energy storage products and solar products is a capital intensive business and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity  the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles  energy storage products andor solar products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness we need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations ramp vehicle production continue research and development projects establish sales delivery and service centers build and deploy superchargers  expand gigafactory 1 ramp production at gigafactory 2 build and commence model 3 production at gigafactory shanghai and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles  energy storage products and solar products we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

 

additionally we use capital from thirdparty investors to enable our customers’ access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront cost the availability of this financing depends upon many factors including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry the quality and mix of our customer contracts any regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing customer contracts changes in law including tax law risks or government incentives associated with these financings and our ability to compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited number of potential investors moreover while interest rates remain at low levels they have risen in recent periods if the rate of return required by investors rises as a result of a rise in interest rates it will reduce the present value of the customer payment streams underlying and therefore the total value of our financing structures increasing our cost of capital if we are unable to establish new financing funds on favorable terms for thirdparty ownership arrangements we may be unable to finance the installation of our solar energy systems for our lease or ppa customers’ systems or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be negatively impacted which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings

we are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in note 17 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k  aside from the settlement with the sec discussed below relating to elon musk’s statement that he was considering taking tesla private to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred however we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the sec the doj or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future moreover we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceedings

for example on october 16 2018 the us district court for the southern district of new york entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the court on september 29 2018 in connection with the actions taken by the sec relating to mr musk’s statement on august 7 2018 that he was considering taking tesla private pursuant to the settlement we among other things paid a civil penalty of 20 million appointed an independent director as the chair of the board appointed two additional independent directors to the board and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governancerelated matters although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement if there is a lack of compliance additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us 

if we update or discontinue the use of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected we may have to shorten the useful lives of any equipment to be retired as a result of any such update and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial results

we have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in what we believe is state of the art tooling machinery and other manufacturing equipment for our various product lines and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful lives however manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cuttingedge equipment more quickly than expected moreover we are continually implementing learnings as our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase which may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment alternatively as we ramp production of model 3 to higher levels our learnings may cause us to discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results 

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched as we have increased vehicle deliveries in markets outside of the us we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro canadian dollar chinese yuan and norwegian krone any strengthening of the us dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars as we have historically experienced in addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact as a result our operating results could be adversely affected

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles

we sell our vehicles directly to consumers using means that we believe will maximize our reach currently including through our website and our own stores while we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in each state in the us as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model in certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses we have opened galleries which are not full sales locations

the application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so

in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws we have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model in some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model a few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate we have also filed a lawsuit in federal court in michigan challenging the constitutionality of the state’s prohibition on direct sales as applied to our business

internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs 

others including our competitors may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services in the event that we were required to take one or more such actions our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention

 

tesla is a highlyvisible public company whose products business results of operations statements and actions are often scrutinized by critics whose influence could negatively impact the perception of our brand and the market value of our common stock 

tesla is a highlyvisible public company whose products business results of operations statements and actions are wellpublicized such attention includes frequent criticism of us by a range of thirdparties our continued success depends on our ability to focus on executing on our mission and business plan while maintaining the trust of our current and potential customers employees stockholders and business partners any negative perceived actions of ours could influence the perception of our brand or our leadership by our customers suppliers or investors which could adversely impact our business prospects operating results and the market value of our common stock

our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters

our corporate headquarters the tesla factory and gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active regions in northern california and nevada if major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products we may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile

the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 38746 per share and a low of 24459 per share over the last 52 weeks the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in particular a large proportion of our common stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies moreover stockholder litigation like this has been filed against us in the past while we are continuing to defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline 

we provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections regarding sales and production as well as anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions if our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly

 

transactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

the conversion of some or all of the tesla convertible notes or the subsidiary convertible notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes our subsidiary convertible notes have been historically and the other tesla convertible notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances if holders elect to convert their convertible notes we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

moreover in connection with each issuance of the tesla convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible notes we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes

elon musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings if mr musk were forced to sell these shares pursuant to a margin call that he could not avoid or satisfy such sales could cause our stock price to decline

certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to elon musk our chief executive officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third party participants in such offerings and placements we are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially and mr musk were unable to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged shares mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further

antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and other provisions of delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations in addition the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

overview and 2018 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products we also offer maintenance installation operation and other services related to our products

automotive

our production vehicle fleet includes our model s premium sedan and our model x suv which are our highestperformance vehicles and our model 3 a lowerpriced sedan designed for the mass market we continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced autopilot options internet connectivity and free overtheair software updates to provide additional safety convenience and performance features in addition we have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline including model y tesla semi a pickup truck and a new version of the tesla roadster

in 2018 we continued to scale our automotive operations particularly our ramp of model 3 and achieved total production of 254530 vehicles and delivered 245506 vehicles representing yearoveryear increases of approximately 152 and 138 respectively

energy generation and storage

we lease and sell retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers and are ramping our solar roof product that combines solar energy generation with attractive integrated styling our energy storage products which we manufacture at gigafactory 1 consist of powerwall mostly for residential applications and powerpack for commercial industrial and utilityscale applications

during 2018 we deployed 104 gwh of energy storage products nearly tripling our 358 mwh of energy storage deployments during 2017 we also deployed 326 megawatts “mw” of solar energy generation during 2018

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2019 outlook

automotive demand production and deliveries

our goal is to produce the world’s highest quality vehicles as quickly and as costeffectively as possible with a priority on workplace health and safety the worldwide automotive markets for alternative fuel vehicles and selfdriving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so a growing number of companies including established automakers have announced plans to expand and in some cases fully transition to production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles andor to develop selfdriving technologies however we believe that the unique features of our vehicles the safety aspects of each of our vehicles our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with model 3 the innovation and expansion of our global retail service and charging operations and infrastructure and our future vehicles will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets 

 

model 3 was the bestselling premium vehicle in the united states in 2018 vehicles traded in to us by model 3 customers continue to suggest the existence of a wider addressable market for this vehicle than existing owners of midsized premium sedans moreover as we have offered only the longrange midrange and performance variants of model 3 thus far we believe that we will see increased demand with the introduction of less expensive variants such as a version with a base price of 35000 that we intend to offer in the future and additional financing options we commenced in january 2019 production of model 3 for europe and china each of which we believe has a much larger midsized premium sedan market than north america where we have exclusively delivered model 3 to date we also believe that we have an advantage over our competitors with respect to our battery and powertrain technology as our vehicles’ eparated range per kwh is expected to be superior to that of other electric vehicles to be introduced in the near term and we have the ability to improve our vehicles through overtheair software updates we are producing variants including regional versions of model 3 in accordance with the demand that we expect for them however and we have finite production capabilities with long lead times associated with procuring certain parts if our model 3 demand expectations prove inaccurate or we experience delays in introducing planned additional variants including as we begin offering model 3 in new markets we may not be able to timely generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have the capacity to produce we may also be impacted by trade policies political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies in addition the federal tax credit for the purchase of a qualified electric vehicle in the us was reduced to 3750 for any tesla vehicle delivered during the first or second quarter of 2019 and will be further reduced to 1875 for each tesla vehicle delivered in the third or fourth quarter of 2019 and to 0 for each tesla vehicle delivered thereafter we believe that this phaseout likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into 2018 and could create similar pullforwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit in the long run we do not expect a meaningful impact to our sales in the us as we believe that each of our vehicle models offers a compelling proposition even without incentives globally we are also working to and in some cases have already begun to increase the value proposition and affordability of our offerings to customers and offer other financing arrangements over time for example we intend to introduce leasing options for model 3 

our model 3 production ramped dramatically during 2018 and we expect to continue to grow model 3 production to a sustained rate of 7000 vehicles per week at our tesla factory by the end of 2019 as we ramp international deliveries we remain focused on further cost improvements and on increasing the affordability of model 3 furthermore in january 2019 we commenced construction of our gigafactory shanghai in china we expect to build a production process that is optimized and simplified for model 3 production comprised of stamping body joining and paint shops and general assembly at gigafactory shanghai to begin production of certain trims of model 3 for china by the end of 2019 we believe that the efficiencies of local production as well as avoiding certain tariffs on usmanufactured vehicles will allow us to offer model 3 at a lower average selling price in the largest market for electric vehicles in the world inclusive of gigafactory shanghai our goal is to be able to produce 10000 model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis and an annualized output rate in excess of 500000 model 3 vehicles sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 however the timeframe for gigafactory shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online ultimately achieving increased model 3 production costeffectively will require that we timely address any additional bottlenecks that may arise as we continue to ramp and establish sustained supplier capacity including locally at gigafactory shanghai 

we also recently discontinued new custom orders for the 75 kwh versions of model s and model x to focus on longer range versions of our highestperformance flagship vehicles and further differentiate them from model 3 we have gradually increased the level of option standardization across these models and this latest step and our increasing production efficiency have allowed us to reduce the production hours for them while preserving the flexibility to increase output as necessary as model s and model x are produced in the us for the foreseeable future we could be impacted by increased import duties on components sourced from china as well as by tariffs on vehicles exported to china although we intend to partially divert such deliveries to north america and europe if necessary

 

advancing our customerfacing infrastructure remains a top priority delivering vehicles to our customers and the related logistics were challenging during 2018 but we continue to improve these processes to maximize customer satisfaction including by purchasing our own carhauling trucks we are also expanding our servicing capabilities for our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet including by growing our service locations and mobile service fleet moving to twoshift operations at service centers where needed and optimizing our parts distribution network we are also updating the tesla mobile app for scheduling service appointments in order to increase customer convenience as sales of tesla vehicles ramp further we plan to continue to open new tesla retail locations service centers and body shops around the world and we plan to continue to expand our mobile service fleet we also plan to continue to significantly increase the number of superchargers and destination charging connectors globally as well as evolve our supercharger technology to enable faster charging times while reducing our related costs however we will have to stabilize and sustain our delivery and logistics model to deliver an increasing number of vehicles and we have only limited experience with this at scale particularly in markets outside of north america moreover if our growing fleet of customer vehicles particularly model 3 experiences unexpected reliability issues it could overburden our servicing capabilities 

 

finally we are making progress with our selfdriving technology as well as the autopilot features in our vehicles our neural net and functionality continue to improve and we frequently release minor software updates and from time to time release key version updates recently we launched a “navigate on autopilot” feature that allows enabled tesla vehicles under appropriate circumstances and driver input to change lanes transition between freeways and exit freeways while we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have no control our ultimate goal is to achieve full autonomy additionally there is growing competition from other automobile and technology companies in the area of selfdriving

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment

we are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products transitioning away from former channel partners and shifting our sales strategy significantly to sell these products in tesla stores and on our website and through crossselling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners as we continue to implement this strategy we expect that our retrofit solar system deployments will decrease slightly before stabilizing and growing in the second half of the year including through crossselling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners our emphasis for retrofit solar products remains on executing projects for upfront cash generation and profitability rather than absolute volume growth such as by reducing the mix of leased systems and prioritizing residential installations that are combined with our energy storage products

we are continuing with the design iterations and testing on our solar roof product and we are continuing installations at a slow pace with the expectation that we will ramp production with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019

we expect our energy storage products to continue to experience significant growth and we are targeting to more than double our deployments to over 2 gwh in 2019 we see opportunities in north america as well as in australia and europe where energy storage coupled with solar generation may mitigate typically higher electricity rates as well as for projects to increase energy grid reliability we are continuing to ramp production for these products at gigafactory 1 including through a new production line and we have seen further manufacturing efficiencies and improvements in our installation processes as we ramp

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses

capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately 25 billion mostly to support increases in model 3 production capacity at gigafactory 1 and the tesla factory the establishment of model 3 production capacity at gigafactory shanghai and the addition of manufacturing capacity for model y which we intend to produce in volume by the end of 2020 as well as the ongoing expansion of our retail locations service centers body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger stations

generally we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future due to increases in expected revenues and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency in addition due to our cost management efforts to maximize operational efficiency we expect operating expenses in 2019 to grow by less than 10 from 2018

 

in march 2018 our stockholders approved a new 10year ceo performance award for elon musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones the “2018 ceo performance award” consequently we may incur significant additional noncash stockbased compensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting 

automotive financing options

we offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain markets in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners currently both programs are available only in certain international markets resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following december 31 2018 totaled 1497 million in value

we have adopted the new revenue recognition standard asc 606 effective january 1 2018 this impacts the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners which now generally qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return in addition for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018 we have ceased recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach

vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used vehicles in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows to date we have only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us based on current market demand for our vehicles we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts but resale prices may inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially

we currently offer model s and model x leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the us and canada  we also offer leasing through leasing partners in certain jurisdictions leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk in addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities we assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our financing offerings including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them and to support the overall financing needs of our customers to the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

energy generation and storage financing options

we offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements these contractual arrangements include longterm leases and ppas in both structures we install our solar energy systems at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee in the lease structure this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee in the ppa structure we charge customers a fee per kilowatthour or kwh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces the leases and ppas are typically for 20 years with a renewal option and the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations

for customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems we also offer solar loans whereby a thirdparty lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed installed and serviced by us we enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer separately the customer enters into a loan agreement with a thirdparty lender who finances the full purchase price we are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the thirdparty lender and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan

 

gigafactory 1 

we continue to develop gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products we also continue to invest in the future expansion of gigafactory 1 and in additional production capacity there for example we have announced that we will likely manufacture model y at gigafactory 1

panasonic has partnered with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices as these terms convey to us the right to use as defined in asc 840 leases  their production equipment we consider them to be leased assets when production commences this results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations for all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory 1 we will apply similar accounting during the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded 7666 million on the consolidated balance sheet

while we currently believe that our progress at gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp for example we have in the past experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at gigafactory 1 which negatively affected our production of model 3 while we continue to resolve such issues at gigafactory 1 as they arise given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate

gigafactory 2

we have an agreement with the suny foundation for the construction of a factory with the intended capacity to produce at least 10 gw of solar products annually in buffalo new york referred to as gigafactory 2 in december 2016 we entered into an agreement with panasonic under which it manufactures custom pv cells and modules for us primarily at gigafactory 2 and we purchase certain quantities of pv cells and modules from panasonic during the 10year term

the terms of our agreement with the suny foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants and any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the suny foundation and result in termination of the agreement although we remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 2 our expectations as to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits

gigafactory shanghai

we are constructing gigafactory shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of model 3 for customers in china by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the us we broke ground in january 2019 and subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online we expect to begin production of certain trims of model 3 at gigafactory shanghai by the end of 2019 we expect much of the investment in gigafactory shanghai to be provided through local debt financing supported by limited direct capital expenditures by us moreover we are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory to be less than that of our model 3 production at the tesla factory from which we have drawn learnings that should allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout and processes at gigafactory shanghai

other manufacturing

we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities and construct our planned facilities and continually explore additional production capacity internationally 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

adoption of new revenue standard

on january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers “new revenue standard” using the modified retrospective method the new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

automotive segment

automotive sales revenue 

automotive sales without resale value guarantee 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates we recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business other features and services such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle revenue related to autopilot and full selfdriving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available 

at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue 

costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates as our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

 

automotive sales with resale value guarantee 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value

with the exception of two programs which are discussed within the automotive leasing section we now recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise the performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values the two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option and vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee where exercise is probable 

prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised for certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under asc 840 leases  we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate the remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciated their value less estimated residual value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory

automotive regulatory credits 

california and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zeroemission vehicles these laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zeroemission vehicles may earn regulatory credits “zev credits” and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers as a manufacturer solely of zeroemission vehicles we have earned emission credits such as zev and ghg credits on our vehicles and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future we enter into contractual agreements with thirdparties to purchase our regulatory credits payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business we recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

automotive leasing revenue 

automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases

direct vehicle leasing program 

we have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the us canada and europe currently the direct vehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the us and canada qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases we record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue

we capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option 

we offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees to certain leasing partner sales in the united states these transactions entail a transfer of leases which we have originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner as control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard these transactions continue to be accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with asc 840 leases  under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue we amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue in cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue

on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts as we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values although we have not experienced any material losses during any period to date

 

vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee where exercise is probable 

for certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise we have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory

services and other revenue 

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers there were no significant changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard 

revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a standready obligation to the customer we sell used vehicles services service plans vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations payment for used vehicles services and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet 

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage sales 

energy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and accepted by the customer payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business

 

for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance 

in instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets however any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems as our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred

as part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract in certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur

we record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term 

energy generation and storage leasing 

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under ppas we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term 

 

we capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or ppas which include the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or ppa 

inventory valuation

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results

warranties

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy storage products we sell in addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of the new revenue standard automotive sales with resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets require a corresponding warranty accrual warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations

stockbased compensation

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock option awards with only service conditions and espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures

 

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations

income taxes

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2018 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings we were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities the tax act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets

 

in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date as such in accordance with sab 118 we completed our analysis during the fourth quarter of 2018 considering current legislation and guidance resulting in no material adjustments from the provisional amounts recorded during the prior year 

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity “vie” of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs  the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value “hlbv” method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties the thirdparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets

 

business combinations 

we account for business acquisitions under asc 805 business combinations  the total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date we recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed we recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests we include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date

when determining such fair values we make significant estimates and assumptions critical estimates include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from our estimates furthermore our estimates might change as additional information becomes available as more fully discussed in note 3 business combinations  included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

revenues

 



 

automotive  services and other segment

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to sale of new model s model x and model 3 vehicles including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers our revenue from nonzev regulatory credits generally follows our production and delivery trends as we have longterm contracts with existing customers for the sale of these credits however as we do not have longterm contracts for zev credit sales revenue from sale of zev credits fluctuate by quarter depending on when a contract is executed with a buyer for example our revenue from zev credit sales in the three months ended december 31 2017 was 1791 million while it was 0 in the three months ended june 30 2018

automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for model s and model x vehicles under direct lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting we do not yet offer leasing for model 3 vehicles

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers

 

2018 compared to 2017 

automotive sales revenue increased 910 billion or 107 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to an increase of approximately 144330 model 3 deliveries from our significant production ramp in the year ended december 31 2018 delivered at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent yearoveryear additionally we recognized 140 billion of additional automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard and an increase of 583 million in sales of regulatory credits to 4186 million in the year ended december 31 2018 zev credits sales were 1034 million and nonzev regulatory credits sales were 3152 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2797 million zev credit sales and 806 million in nonzev regulatory credit sales in the year ended december 31 2017 the growth in nonzev regulatory credits yearoveryear was generally consistent with the delivery volume growth the above increases in revenue were offset by a decrease of approximately 3240 model s and model x deliveries during the year ended december 31 2018 excluding the impact of adoption of the new revenue standard at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 

automotive leasing revenue decreased 2231 million or 20 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of 8327 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended december 31 2017 when our counterparty retains ownership any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee are settled to automotive leasing revenue

services and other revenue increased 3899 million or 39 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of tradein vehicles partially offset by lower average selling prices for used vehicles sales due to an increase in tradeins of relatively lower priced nontesla vehicles in the year ended december 31 2018 additionally there was an increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow these increases were partially offset by a decrease in powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017

2017 compared to 2016 

automotive sales revenue increased 295 billion or 53 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily related to a 58 increase in deliveries to 80060 vehicles resulting from increased sales of model s and model x at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior period as well as sales of 1764 model 3 vehicles since its launch in the third quarter of 2017 additionally sales of regulatory credits increased by 580 million to 3603 million in the year ended december 31 2017 zev credits sales were 2797 million and nonzev regulatory credits sales were 806 million in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2154 million zev credit sales and 869 million in nonzev regulatory credit sales in the year ended december 31 2016 the increases were partially offset by additional deferrals of autopilot 20 revenue in the year ended december 31 2017

automotive leasing revenue increased 3448 million or 45 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and expiration of resale value guarantees as compared to the year ended december 31 2016

service and other revenue increased 5332 million or 114 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales as a result of increased automotive sales as well as from the expansion of our tradein program additionally there was a 411 million increase from the inclusion of engineering service revenue from grohmann engineering gmbh now tesla grohmann automation gmbh which we acquired on january 3 2017 and a 684 million increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continued to grow during the year ended december 31 2017

 

energy generation and storage segment 

energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and ppas and the sale of solar energy systems incentives

2018 compared to 2017 

energy generation and storage revenue increased by 4390 million or 39 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to increases in deployments of powerpack powerwall and cash and loan solar energy systems projects the increase in powerpack revenue was significant yearoveryear due to increases in revenue recognized for commercial projects most predominantly 812 million for the south australia battery project additionally we increased powerwall production in the year ended december 31 2018 which helped us to continue to work through our energy storage order backlog 

2017 compared to 2016 

energy generation and storage revenue increased by 9349 million or 515 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity on november 21 2016

cost of revenues and gross margin

 



 

 

automotive  services and other segment

cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand 

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs

costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services  costs to acquire and certify used vehicles and costs for retail merchandise cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers

2018 compared to 2017 

cost of automotive sales revenue increased 696 billion or 104 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to a significantly higher volume of model 3 vehicles deliveries in 2018 and the recognition of 9698 million of additional cost of automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard these increases were partially offset by significant reductions in model 3 average costs per unit compared to the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in 2017 and other cost efficiencies additionally there were lower overall costs for model s and model x cash deliveries from approximately 3240 fewer units delivered yearoveryear and reductions in combined model s and model x average costs per unit as a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies 

cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased 2198 million or 31 in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of 6244 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard partially offset by increased cost of automotive leasing revenue from an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended december 31 2017 when our counterparty retains ownership the net book value of the leased vehicle of the lease vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue

cost of services and other revenue increased 6513 million or 53 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to the increase in the cost of our new service centers additional service personnel in existing and new service centers mobile service capabilities parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles additionally there was an overall increase in the cost of used vehicle sales from the increased volume of relatively lower priced nontesla tradein vehicles these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017

 

gross margin for total automotive remained relatively consistent at 23 in the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 there were increases from improved model s and model x combined margins as costs per unit decreased yearoveryear from continuing manufacturing efficiencies and an increase in regulatory credits sales which have no associated costs the increases were partially offset by margin dilution from model 3 despite model 3 margins improving yearoveryear the higher proportion of model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales in the year ended december 31 2018 lowered our overall gross margin for total automotive as model 3 had a lower annualized margin than model s and model x due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 and as we have yet to achieve significant manufacturing efficiencies in the production of model 3 

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment remained relatively consistent at 19 in the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above services and other has historically operated at lower margins than our automotive sales and leasing business but has a small impact on the overall segment margin because of its relatively small revenue base

2017 compared to 2016 

cost of automotive sales revenues increased 246 billion or 58 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to a 58 increase in vehicle deliveries resulting from increased sales of model s and model x as well as the commencement of deliveries of model 3 in the third quarter of 2017

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2262 million or 47 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million in cost of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and the expiration of resale value guarantees

cost of services and other revenue increased 7566 million or 160 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sales due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow

gross margin for total automotive decreased from 25 to 23 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the commencement of deliveries of model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the full operating costs and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volumes as production ramps and increases in early payoffs and expirations of resale value guarantees yearoveryear contributed to the lower gross margin lower material and manufacturing costs for model s and model x as we further improved our vehicle production processes and the partial recognition of autopilot 20 revenue in the year ended december 31 2017 partially offset the overall decrease

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment decreased from 23 to 19 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 these decreases are driven by the factors impacting gross margin for total automotive as explained above as well as higher costs of maintenance service

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets in addition where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 

 

2018 compared to 2017 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 4904 million or 56 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to increases in deployments of powerpack powerwall and cash and loan solar energy system projects the increase in powerpack cost of revenue was significant yearoveryear due to increases in cost of revenue recognized for commercial projects most predominantly 725 million for the south australia battery project additionally costs for cash and loan solar energy system projects have increased from higher installation costs higher allocation of overhead costs from lower deployment of solar projects overall and certain warranty related onetime charges there were also higher costs for our solar energy system leasing arrangements due to impairment charges and higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our solar roof ramp

gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 22 to 12 in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to the higher proportion of energy storage of our overall energy generation and storage portfolio due to a threefold growth of mwh of energy storage deployments in the year ended december 31 2018 although energy storage margins have improved significantly as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 it continues to operate at a lower margin than our solar business thereby having a greater dilutive impact on our gross margin in the year ended december 31 2018 additionally increases in costs for our cash and loan solar energy system projects impairment charges on solar energy system leasing arrangements and temporary manufacturing underutilization of our solar roof ramp have further contributed to the decrease in gross margin

2017 compared to 2016 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 6962 million or 390 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity on november 21 2016

gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 2 to 22 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue and costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity

interest expense increased by 2724 million or 137 in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of interest expense from solarcity of 1855 million for the year ended december 31 2017 in addition our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 mainly due to the convertible senior notes due in 2022 and the senior notes due in 2025 both of which we issued during 2017

other income expense net

 



 

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates

other income expense net changed favorably by 1472 million to a gain of 219 million in the year ended december 31 2018 from a loss of 1254 million in the year ended december 31 2017 the change was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and gains from interest rate swaps related to our debt facilities yearoveryear additionally we had 577 million of losses in the year ended december 31 2017 for measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair values of certain solarcity liabilities as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2016 with no corresponding expense in the year ended december 31 2018

other income expense net changed unfavorably by 2367 million to a loss of 1254 million in the year ended december 31 2017 from a gain of 1113 million in the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease was primarily due to 577 million of losses in the year ended december 31 2017 for measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of solarcity and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 

provision for income taxes 

 



 

our provision for income taxes increased by 263 million or 83 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions yearoveryear

our provision for income taxes increased by 49 million or 18 in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily due to the increase in vehicle deliveries in foreign tax jurisdictions partially offset by 105 million of future us alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of the tax act which previously had an associated valuation allowance

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

 



 

our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2018 we had 369 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 7490 million and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euros and japanese yen our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings

our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products increases in model 3 production capacity at the tesla factory the establishment of model 3 production capacity at gigafactory shanghai the continued expansion of gigafactory 1 the addition of manufacturing capacity for model y with the expectation to achieve volume production by the end of 2020 and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network we currently expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately 25 billion

 

in 2019  we will continue to utilize our increasing experience and learnings from past and current product ramps to do so at a level of capital efficiency per dollar of spend that we expect to be significantly greater than historical levels for example based on our experience with ramping model 3 at the tesla factory we expect that the capital spend per unit of model 3 manufacturing capacity at gigafactory shanghai will be less than that of our line in fremont likewise based on such experience and the substantial commonality of components we expect between model y and model 3 we believe that the production ramp of model y will be significantly faster than that of model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of model 3 at fremont considering the pipeline of new products planned at this point and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture cells as well as considering all other infrastructure growth and expansion of gigafactory 1 gigafactory 2 and gigafactory shanghai  we currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between 25 to 30 billion annually for the next two fiscal years   moreover we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our nearterm debt obligations including the repayment of 9200 million for our 025 convertible senior notes due on march 1 2019 although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources for example we expect that much of our investment in gigafactory shanghai will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in china as always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business 

we have an agreement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following full production at gigafactory 2 we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the state of new york and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network we may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

in addition we had 150 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of december 31 2018 some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts our interests in financing funds or various other assets and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds upon the drawdown of any unused committed amounts there are no restrictions on the use of such funds for general corporate purposes for details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to note 13 longterm debt obligations  and note 18 variable interest entity arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

foreign currency risk

we transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro japanese yen canadian dollar chinese yuan and norwegian krone in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar for our foreign subsidiaries accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income loss as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances for the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized a net foreign currency gain of 15 million in other income expense net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the euro new taiwan dollar and canadian dollar for the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized a net foreign currency loss of 523 million in other income expense net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the euro canadian dollar and norwegian krone 

we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm these changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income loss before income taxes these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of 1757 million at december 31 2018 and 1160 million at december 31 2017

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes a hypothetical 10 change in our interest rates would have increased our interest expense for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 by 85 million and 76 million respectively

overview 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems and also install and maintain such systems and sell solar electricity we are the world’s only vertically integrated sustainable energy company offering endtoend clean energy products including generation storage and consumption we have established and continue to grow a global network of stores vehicle service centers and supercharger stations to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products and we continue to develop selfdriving capability in order to improve vehicle safety our sustainable energy products engineering expertise intense focus to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and business model differentiate us from other companies 

we currently produce and sell three fully electric vehicles the model s sedan the model x sport utility vehicle “suv” and the model 3 sedan all of our vehicles offer high performance and functionality as well as attractive styling 

we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 and have continued to improve model s by introducing performance allwheel drive dual motor and autopilot options as well as free overtheair software updates we commenced deliveries of model x in september 2015 model x offers seating for up to seven people allwheel drive and our autopilot functionality we commenced deliveries of model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market in july 2017 and continue to ramp its production

we also intend to bring additional vehicles to market in the future including trucks and an allnew sports car the production of fully electric vehicles that meets consumers’ range and performance expectations requires substantial design engineering and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles our design and vehicle engineering capabilities combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system have enabled us to design and develop electric vehicles that we believe overcome the design styling and performance issues that have historically limited broad adoption of electric vehicles as a result our customers enjoy several benefits including







we sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network which we are continuing to grow globally the benefits we receive from distribution ownership enable us to improve the overall customer experience the speed of product development and the capital efficiency of our business we are also continuing to build our network of superchargers and destination chargers in north america europe and asia to provide both fast charging that enables convenient longdistance travel as well as other convenient charging options

in addition we are leveraging our technological expertise in batteries power electronics and integrated systems to manufacture and sell energy storage products in late 2016 we began production and deliveries of our latest generation energy storage products powerwall 2 and powerpack 2 powerwall 2 is a 14 kilowatt hour kwh home battery with an integrated inverter powerpack 2 is an infinitely scalable energy storage system for commercial industrial and utility applications comprised of 210 kwh ac battery packs and 50 kva at 480v inverters 

 

 

similar to our electric vehicles our energy storage products have been developed to receive overtheair firmware and software updates that enable additional features over time   

finally we sell and lease solar systems with or without accompanying energy storage systems to residential and commercial customers and sell renewable energy to residential and commercial customers at prices that are typically below utility rates since 2006 we have installed solar energy systems for hundreds of thousands of customers our longterm lease and power purchase agreements with our customers generate recurring payments and create a portfolio of highquality receivables that we leverage to further reduce the cost of making the switch to solar energy the electricity produced by our solar installations represents a very small fraction of total us electricity generation with tens of millions of singlefamily homes and businesses in our primary service territories and many more in other locations we have a large opportunity to expand and grow this business

we manufacture our vehicle products primarily at our facilities in fremont california lathrop california tilburg netherlands and at our gigafactory 1 near reno nevada we manufacture our energy storage products at gigafactory 1 and our solar products at our factories in fremont california and buffalo new york gigafactory 2

power electronics

the power electronics in our electric vehicle powertrain govern the flow of high voltage electrical current throughout our vehicles and serve to power our electric motor to generate torque while driving and deliver energy into the battery pack while charging

the drive inverter converts direct current “dc” from the battery pack into alternating current “ac” to drive our induction motors and provides “regenerative braking” functionality which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack the primary technological advantages to our designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package

the charger charges the battery pack by converting alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this charger from a common household outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses 

dual motor powertrain

we offer dual motor powertrain vehicles which use two electric motors to provide greater efficiency performance and range in an allwheel drive configuration tesla’s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels the almost instantaneous response of the motors combined with low centers of gravity provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control

vehicle control and infotainment software

the performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software there are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors software algorithms control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle and are also used extensively to monitor the charge state of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions we develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally

selfdriving development

we have expertise in vehicle autopilot systems including autosteering traffic aware cruise control automated lane changing automated parking summon and driver warning systems in october 2016 we began equipping all tesla vehicles with hardware needed for full selfdriving capability including cameras that provide 360 degree visibility updated ultrasonic sensors for object detection a forwardfacing radar with enhanced processing and a powerful new onboard computer our autopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle our system provides safety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit this hardware suite along with overtheair firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard camera radar ultrasonics and gps enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance

our european headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in amsterdam and tilburg our operations in tilburg include final assembly testing and quality control for vehicles delivered within the european union a parts distribution warehouse for service centers throughout europe a center for remanufacturing work and a customer service center

gigafactory 1 outside of reno nevada

gigafactory 1 is a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery material cell module and battery pack production in one location we use the battery packs manufactured at gigafactory 1 for our vehicles including model 3 and energy storage products we also manufacture model 3 drive units at gigafactory 1

gigafactory 1 is being built in phases tesla panasonic and other partners are currently manufacturing inside the finished sections our present plan is to continue expanding gigafactory 1 over the next few years so that its capacity significantly exceeds the approximately 500000 vehicle per year capacity that we announced when we first started developing it and to additionally have sufficient capacity for our energy storage products

we believe that gigafactory 1 will allow us to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs once we are in volume production with model 3 we have committed to substantial capital expenditures for gigafactory 1 panasonic has agreed to partner with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells through our ownership of gigafactory 1 and our partnership with panasonic we own sole access to a facility designed to be the highestvolume and lowestcost source of lithiumion batteries in the world

supply chain

our vehicles use thousands of purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of suppliers we have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts while we obtain components from multiple sources in some cases similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source in addition while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have currently fully qualified only one cell supplier for the battery packs we use in our production vehicles we are working to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers

we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials we believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements

energy storage

our energy storage products are manufactured at gigafactory 1 we leverage the same supply chain process and infrastructure as we use for our vehicles the battery architecture and many of the components used in our energy storage products are the same or similar to those used in our vehicles’ battery pack enabling us to take advantage of manufacturing efficiencies and supply chain economies of scale the power electronics and inverters for the powerwall and powerpack systems are also manufactured at gigafactory 1 allowing us to ship deploymentready systems directly to customers

solar energy systems

we currently purchase major components such as solar panels and inverters directly from multiple manufacturers we typically purchase solar panels and inverters on an asneeded basis from our suppliers at thenprevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued under our master contractual arrangements in december 2016 we entered into a longterm agreement with panasonic to manufacture photovoltaic “pv” cells and modules at our gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york with negotiated pricing provisions and the intent to manufacture at least 10 gigawatt of solar panels annually we have recently started manufacturing solar panels in gigafactory 2 in collaboration with panasonic

 

 

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

vehicles

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives

we have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority “caeatfa” that provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of model s model x model 3 and future electric vehicles and expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in california 

nevada tax incentives

in connection with the construction of gigafactory 1 in nevada we have entered into agreements with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that will provide abatements for sales and use taxes real and personal property taxes and employer excise taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits these incentives are available for the applicable periods ending on june 30 2034 subject to capital investments by tesla and its partners for gigafactory 1 of at least 350 billion in the aggregate on or before june 30 2024 which were met as of december 31 2017 and certain other conditions specified in the agreements if we do not satisfy one or more conditions under the agreements tesla will be required to repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of the tax incentives incurred plus interest

tesla regulatory credits

in connection with the production delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles charging infrastructure and solar systems in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits we have sold these credits and will continue to sell future credits to automotive companies and regulated entities for example under california’s zeroemission vehicle regulation and those of states that have adopted california’s standard vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements these laws provide that automakers may bank excess credits referred to as zev credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell their credits to other regulated parties pursuant to the us environmental protection agency’s “epa” national greenhouse gas “ghg” emission standards and similar standards adopted by the canadian government car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average carbon dioxide emissions standards manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can use the credits to comply with these regulatory requirements many us states have also adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production these requirements enable companies deploying solar energy to earn tradable credits known as solar renewable energy certificates “srecs”

regulation—vehicle safety and testing

our vehicles are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards “fmvss” our vehicles fully comply with all applicable fmvsss without the need for any exemptions and we expect future tesla vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies additionally there are regulatory changes being considered for several fmvss and while we anticipate compliance there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted

as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable fmvss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the us numerous fmvss apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements we are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by nhtsa including the cafe standards theft prevention act requirements consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition this 

 

 

law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted 

our vehicles sold outside of the us are subject to foreign safety testing regulations many of those regulations are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the us and may require redesign andor retesting the european union has proposed new rules that if approved may significantly change the manner that vehicles are certified for compliance in europe by creating more individual countrybycountry typeapproval requirements instead of the current singular europewide system

regulation – self driving

there are no federal us regulations pertaining to the safety of selfdriving vehicles however nhtsa has established recommended guidelines certain us states have legal restrictions on selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them this patchwork increases legal complexity for our vehicles in europe certain vehicle safety regulations apply to selfdriving braking and steering systems and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of selfdriving vehicles selfdriving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the us and foreign countries and may create restrictions on our selfdriving features

regulation—battery safety and testing

our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation the regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation such as by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations

we use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs the cells do not contain any lead mercury cadmium or heavy metals our battery packs include certain materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation

state laws regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state as we open additional tesla stores and service centers we secure dealer licenses or their equivalent and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers a few states such as michigan and connecticut do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet phone or mail in such states we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and are not retail locations

as we expand our retail footprint in the us some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations we expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model in addition we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations and we intend to actively fight any such efforts to limit our ability to sell our own vehicles

while we have analyzed the principal laws in the us eu china japan uk and australia relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis of all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in certain jurisdictions that may restrict our sales and service operations

 

 

energy storage 

the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development nevertheless there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local level that support the adoption of energy storage for example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 30 tax credit under section 48a3 of the internal revenue code or the irc as described below in addition california and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program

the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets in 2011 and 2013 ferc removed many barriers for systems like energy storage to provide frequency regulation service thus increasing the value these systems can obtain in wholesale energy markets more recently in late 2016 ferc released a notice of proposed rulemaking that if it becomes a final rule would further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets finally in january 2017 ferc issued a statement supporting the use of energy storage as both electric transmission and as electric generation concurrently thus enabling energy storage systems to provide greater value to the electric grid

solar energy systems

government and utility programs and incentives

us federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates

the federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit or federal itc under two sections of the irc section 48 and section 25d section 48a3 of the irc allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar energy system that commences construction by december 31 2019 the credit then declines to 26 in 2020 22 in 2021 and a permanent 10 thereafter we claim the section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial projects based on ownership of the solar energy system the federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy systems section 25d of the irc allows a homeownertaxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by december 31 2019 the credit then declines to 26 in 2020 and 22 in 2021 and is scheduled to expire thereafter customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash or through our solar loan are eligible to claim the section 25d investment tax credit

in addition to the federal itc many us states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentive available for solar energy systems

regulation – general

we are not a “regulated utility” in the us to operate our systems we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities in almost all cases interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been preapproved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body 

sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases and ppas face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions

regulation – net metering

thirtyeight states washington dc and puerto rico have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their onsite solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid each of the states where we currently serve customers has adopted a net metering policy except for texas where certain individual utilities have adopted net metering or a policy similar to net metering in certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so

 

 

regulation – mandated renewable capacity 

many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production such as an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or rps or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources such as solar energy systems in solar renewable energy certificate or srec state markets the rps requires electricity suppliers to secure a portion of their electricity from solar generators the srec program provides a means for srecs to be created a srec represents the renewable energy associated with 1000 kwhs of electricity produced from a solar energy system when a solar energy system generates 1000 kwhs of electricity one srec is issued by a government agency which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entities who surrender the srecs to the state to prove compliance with the state’s renewable energy mandate

competition 

vehicles

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more so in the future as we introduce additional vehicles including model 3 which will compete with lowerpriced vehicles

we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology for example model s and model x compete primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan and premium suv markets with internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers and model 3 competes with small to mediumsized sedans our vehicles also compete with vehicles propelled by alternative fuels principally electricity

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the us market as well in addition several manufacturers sell hybrid vehicles including plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles 

energy storage

the market for energy storage products is also highly competitive established companies such as aes energy storage siemens lg chem and samsung as well as various emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio there are several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems such as cells battery modules and power electronics as well as others providing integrated systems we compete with these companies on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specifications of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our powerpack 2 product give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products

solar energy systems

the primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers we compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems we also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations in the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitors include vivint solar inc sunrun inc trinity solar sunpower corporation and many smaller local solar companies

intellectual property 

as part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and 

 

 

other contractual arrangements additionally we previously announced a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

risks related to our business and industry

we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays or other complications in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of new vehicles and other products such as model 3 our energy storage products and the solar roof which could harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

we have previously experienced launch manufacturing and production ramp delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models such as model s model x and model 3 and new vehicle features such as the allwheel drive dual motor drivetrain on model s and the second version of autopilot hardware for example we encountered unanticipated challenges such as certain supply chain constraints that led to initial delays in producing model x similarly we have experienced certain bottlenecks in the production of model 3 in places like the battery module assembly line at gigafactory 1 leading to delays in its ramp if such issues continue longer than expected or new issues arise or recur with respect to model 3 or any of our other production vehicles we could experience further delays in addition because our vehicle models share certain production facilities with other models the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other models

we may also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles such as our tesla semi truck our planned model y and new tesla roadster our energy storage products and the solar roof any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of our current products or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future products including complications associated with expanding our production capacity and supply chain or obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

we may experience delays in realizing our projected timelines and cost and volume targets for the production and ramp of our model 3 vehicle which could harm our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results

our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to manufacture market and sell the model 3 vehicle which we are offering at a lower price point and which we intend to produce at significantly higher volumes than our present production capabilities for the model s or model x vehicles we commenced production and initial customer deliveries of model 3 in july 2017 and are targeting a forecasted production rate of 5000 model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter of 2018 

we have no experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we anticipate for model 3 and to be successful we will need to complete the implementation and ramp of efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains necessary to support such volumes we are employing a higher degree of automation in our materials conveyance battery module production and other manufacturing processes for model 3 than we have previously employed and in some cases we have implemented interim processes such as semiautomated manufacturing lines for which we are likely to incur additional labor costs until we bring online our fully automated processes moreover our model 3 production plan has generally required and will require significant investments of cash and management resources

our production plan for model 3 is based on many key assumptions including





 

 







if one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect our ability to meet our model 3 projections on time and at volumes and prices that are profitable the number of current and future model 3 reservations as well as our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 

we may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production and delivery plans both of which could harm our business and prospects

our plans call for significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries to high volumes in a short amount of time our ability to achieve these plans will depend upon a number of factors including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity achieve the planned production yield and further increase capacity as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels and optimize design and production changes and our suppliers’ ability to support our needs in addition we have used and may use in the future a number of new manufacturing technologies techniques and processes for our vehicles which we must successfully introduce and scale for high volume production for example we have introduced highly automated production lines aluminum spot welding systems and highspeed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts we have also introduced unique design features in our vehicles with different manufacturing challenges such as large display screens dual motor drivetrain autopilot hardware and falconwing doors we have limited experience developing manufacturing selling and servicing and allocating our available resources among multiple products simultaneously if we are unable to realize our plans our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially damaged

concurrent with the significant planned increase in our vehicle production levels we will also need to continue to significantly increase deliveries of and servicing capacity for our vehicles although we have a plan for delivering and servicing significantly increased volumes of vehicles we have limited experience in delivering a high volume of vehicles and no experience in delivering and servicing vehicles at the significantly higher volumes we anticipate for model 3 and we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans into both existing markets as well as new markets into which we expand if we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery and servicing needs globally this could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

we are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products according to our schedule and at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

our products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers although we attempt to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible any significant unanticipated demand would require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time and in the past we have also replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our products moreover we have signed longterm agreements with panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier for lithiumion cells at gigafactory 1 in nevada and pv cells and panels at gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york if we encounter unexpected difficulties with key suppliers such as panasonic 

 

 

and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers we could experience production delays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing servicing and supporting our products 

this limited and in many cases single source supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our products such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slowerthanplanned model s and model x ramps furthermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars governmental changes natural disasters such as the march 2011 earthquakes in japan and other factors beyond our and our suppliers’ control could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to product design changes and delays in product deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

changes in our supply chain have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost we have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made and we may experience similar cost increases in the future certain suppliers have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements additionally we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer 

the foregoing discussion applies to model 3 and our energy storage products as well however because we plan to produce model 3 at significantly higher volumes than model s or model x the negative impact of any delays or other constraints with respect to our suppliers for model 3 could be substantially greater than any such issues experienced with respect to our other products as some of our suppliers for model s and model x do not have the resources equipment or capability to provide components for the model 3 in line with our requirements we have engaged a significant number of new suppliers and we need such suppliers to ramp and deliver according to our schedule there is no assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to meet our cost quality and volume needs or do so at the times needed furthermore as the scale of our vehicle production increases we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities components at much higher volumes than we have experience with if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with model 3

our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular although we have successfully grown demand for model s and model x have seen very strong initial demand for model 3 and believe that we will be able to continue to grow demand separately for each of these and future vehicles there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicles will not compete with one another in the market moreover the mass market demographic which we are targeting with model 3 is larger but more competitive than the demographic for model s and model x and additional electric vehicles are entering the market 

if the market for electric vehicles in general and tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in key and other markets our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new rapidly evolving and could be affected by numerous external factors such as 





 

 









future problems or delays in expanding gigafactory 1 or ramping operations there could negatively affect the production and profitability of our products such as model 3

to lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume we have vertically integrated the production of lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for model 3 and energy storage products at gigafactory 1 while gigafactory 1 began producing lithiumion cells for energy storage products in january 2017 and has since begun producing lithiumion cells for model 3 we have no other direct experience in the production of lithiumion cells given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of expanding and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to ramp production and expand than we currently anticipate in order to reach our planned volume and gross margin for model 3 we must have significant cell production from gigafactory 1 which among other things requires panasonic to successfully ramp its allnew cell production lines to significant volumes over a short period of time although panasonic has a long track record of producing highquality cells at significant volume at its factories in japan it has never before started and ramped cell production at a factory in the us like at gigafactory 1 in addition we have started producing several components for model 3 such as battery modules incorporating the lithiumion cells produced by panasonic at gigafactory 1 some of the manufacturing lines for such components have taken longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity we expect that we will continue to experience challenges as we move through the ramp and we will continue to finetune our manufacturing lines to address them while we currently believe that we will reach our production targets if we are unable to resolve ramping challenges and expand gigafactory 1 production in a timely manner and at reasonable prices and if we or panasonic are unable to attract hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel our ability to supply battery packs or other components for model 3 and our other products could be negatively impacted any such problems or delays with gigafactory 1 could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

if our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed

if our vehicles or our energy products were to contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as full selfdriving take longer than expected to become enabled or are legally restricted our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and could conceivably contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks issues experienced by customers have included those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery in the model s and the seats and doors in the model x although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not be up to the satisfaction of our customers while we have performed extensive internal testing on the products we manufacture we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs powertrains vehicles and energy storage products there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for consumers 

any product defects delays or legal restrictions on product features or other failure of our products to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays product recalls product liability claims significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects model 3 has not yet been evaluated by nhtsa for a star rating under the new car assessment program and while based on our internal evaluation we expect to obtain comparable ratings to those achieved by model s and model x there is no assurance this will occur 

 

 

if we fail to scale our business operations and otherwise manage future growth and adapt to new conditions effectively as we rapidly grow our company including internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our products successfully 

any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we continue to expand our operations significantly including internationally including by a transition to high volume vehicle production with the ramp of model 3 and the worldwide sales delivery and servicing of a significantly higher number of vehicles than our current vehicle fleet in the coming years furthermore we are developing and growing our energy storage product and solar business worldwide including in countries where we have limited or no previous operating experience in connection with our vehicle business our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully we may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to control expenses and avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs establish sufficient worldwide automobile sales delivery service and supercharger facilities in a timely manner adapt our products and conduct our operations to meet local requirements implement the required infrastructure systems and processes and find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing engineering service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel 

if we are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing costs for our vehicles including model 3 our financial condition and operating results will suffer 

while we have experienced and expect in the future to realize cost reductions by both us and our suppliers there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals we incur significant costs related to procuring the materials required to manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel we may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in utilizing and increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facilities such as for model 3 furthermore if we are unable to achieve production cost targets on our vehicles pursuant to our plans we may not be able to meet our gross margin and other financial targets many of the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control such as potential increases in the costs of our materials and components such as lithium nickel and other components of our battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels if we are unable to continue to control and reduce our manufacturing costs our operating results business and prospects will be harmed 

we are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of a limited fleet of electric vehicles which currently includes model s model x and model 3 

we currently generate a significant percentage of our revenues from the sale of two products model s and model x vehicles model 3 for which we are planning significantly higher volumes than model s or model x has required and will continue to require significant investment in connection with its ongoing ramp and there is no guarantee that it will be commercially successful historically automobile customers have come to expect a variety of vehicles offered in a manufacturer’s fleet and new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently in order to meet these expectations we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models to the extent our product variety and cycles do not meet consumer expectations or cannot be produced on our projected timelines and cost and volume targets our future sales may be adversely affected this could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

our vehicles and energy storage products make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns and future events may lead to additional concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications 

the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or redesign efforts all of which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithiumion 

 

 

cells such as a vehicle or other fire even if such incident does not involve our vehicles or energy storage products could seriously harm our business 

in addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our facilities and plan to produce high volumes of cells and battery modules and packs at gigafactory 1 any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall moreover any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of materials in particular for lithiumion cells could harm our business

we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various materials in our business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers the prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased production of electric vehicles and energy storage products by our competitors and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells these risks include







our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage products while we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells manufactured at our own facilities we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers in particular we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in battery packs for our current production vehicles any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for energy products until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs substantial increases in the prices for our materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by battery cell suppliers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims

although we design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road product liability claims could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected as is true for other automakers our cars have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury and such crashes where autopilot is engaged are the subject of significant public attention we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims related to misuse or failures of new technologies that we are pioneering including autopilot in our vehicles moreover as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause 

 

 

injury to people or property a successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicles and energy storage products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results in most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds not by insurance 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industries we currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from companies with new technology 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future there is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete many established and new automobile manufacturers such as audi bmw daimler general motors toyota and volvo as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and applications in some cases such competitors have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sales networks and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition our model 3 vehicle faces competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes

the solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive we face competition from other manufacturers developers and installers of solar and energy storage systems as well as from large utilities decreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and ppas moreover solar panel and lithiumion battery prices have declined and are continuing to decline as we increase our battery and solar manufacturing capabilities including at gigafactory 1 and gigafactory 2 future price declines may harm our ability to produce energy storage systems and solar systems at competitive prices

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industries then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially

consumers may be less likely to purchase our products now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operations will continue in the long term similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors such as our limited operating history unfamiliarity with our products competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services and our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed

 

 

our plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by expand ing our network of tesla stores galleries delivery centers service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to additional sales or installations of our products or availability of superchargers 

we plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by globally expanding our network of tesla stores galleries delivery centers service centers mobile service offerings and superchargers these plans will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales or installations of our products this ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry into markets in which we have limited or no experience selling delivering installing andor servicing our products and which may pose legal regulatory labor cultural and political challenges that we have not previously encountered may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and installations and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore the increasing number of model s and model x vehicles as well as the significant increase in our vehicle fleet size that we expect from model 3 will require us to continue to increase the number of our supercharger stations and connectors significantly if we fail to do so our customers could become dissatisfied which could adversely affect sales of our vehicles we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale installation and service of our products the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of superchargers in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delays or cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our customer infrastructure network or our expansion plans are not successful in continuing to grow demand this could lead to a decrease or stagnation in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we face risks associated with our international operations and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions and with establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business

we currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions that are subject to legal political and regulatory requirements and social and economic conditions that may be very different from those affecting us domestically additionally as part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sales delivery service and supercharger locations internationally international expansion requires us to make significant expenditures including the establishment of local operating entities hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention these risks include conforming our products to various international regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations challenges in attracting customers foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements our ability to enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products 

if we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing programs our business may suffer 

we offer vehicle financing arrangements for model s and model x through our local subsidiaries in the us canada germany and the uk including leasing directly through certain of those subsidiaries the profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk we expect the need for leasing and other financing options will continue to be important to model s and model x deliveries and for model 3 in the long term if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers we may be unable to grow our sales furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties either of which may harm our business

 

 

the unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determinations with respect to government and economic incentives in the u  s  and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our products and services 

we currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the us and abroad such incentives include among other things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes taxes on nonrecurring vehicle fees the 25 value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gaspowered vehicles notably the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gaspowered vehicles through the oil and gas industries nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example in april 2017 and january 2016 respectively previously available incentives in hong kong and denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired negatively impacting sales moreover under current regulations a 7500 federal tax credit available in the us for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kwh of battery capacity such as our vehicles will begin to phase out over time with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200000 th qualifying vehicle in the us we currently expect such 200000 th qualifying delivery to occur at some point during 2018 in addition california implemented regulations phasing out a 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for highincome consumers which became effective in march 2016 in certain circumstances there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles

in addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our installation costs and cost of capital and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds however these incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase often without warning for example the federal government currently offers a 30 investment tax credit “itc” for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility the itc is currently scheduled to decline to 10 and expire altogether for residential systems by january 2022 likewise in jurisdictions where net energy metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use several jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so such reductions in or termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results by making our products less competitive for potential customers increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets additionally the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act in the us could potentially increase the cost and decrease the availability of renewable energy financing by reducing the value of depreciation benefits associated with and the overall investor tax capacity needed to monetize renewable energy projects such changes could lower the overall investment willingness and capacity for such projects available in the market

moreover we and our fund investors claim the itc in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar and energy storage systems although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower and they may do so in the future such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments or contribute additional assets to our funds or fund investors

any failure by us to realize the expected benefits of our substantial investments and commitments with respect to the manufacture of pv cells and modules including if we are unable to comply with the terms of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory 2 could result in negative consequences for our business

we own certain pv cell and module manufacturing and technology assets and a buildtosuit lease arrangement with the research foundation for the state university of new york the “suny foundation” this agreement with the suny foundation provides for the construction of gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york which at full capacity we expect will be capable of producing at least 10 gigawatt of pv cells and modules annually including for our solar roof under this agreement we are obligated to among other things employ specified 

 

 

minimum numbers of personnel in the state of new york and spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following the completion of all construction and related infrastructure the arrival of manufacturing equipment and the receipt of certain permits and other specified items at gigafactory 2 if we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations we would be obligated to pay a “program payment” of 412 million to the suny foundation in such year any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts to the suny foundation the termination of our lease at gigafactory 2 andor the need to secure an alternative supply of pv cells and modules for products such as our solar roof moreover if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and technology assets in accordance with our expectations we may have to recognize accounting charges pertaining to the writeoff of such assets any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer and jeffrey b straubel our chief technical officer 

none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

key talent may leave tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience in california nevada and other regions where we have operations there is increasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineering manufacturing engineering and other skills such as electrical and building construction expertise this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner especially to support our expansion plans and ramp to highvolume manufacture of vehicles and retain current employees additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones could have an adverse effect on our performance

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer chairman of our board of directors and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures

on february 8 2018 we filed a proxy statement with the us securities and exchange commission pursuant to which we are seeking stockholder approval of the grant in january 2018 of a 10year performancebased stock option award for mr musk which will be forfeited if not so approved the “ceo performance award” mr musk currently has no other compensation at tesla other than a prior performancebased stock option award granted to mr musk in 2012 which has vested as to 9 out of 10 tranches and a statemandated minimum wage salary that he has never accepted there is no assurance that the ceo performance award will receive stockholder approval

we are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities 

as a manufacturing company including with respect to facilities such as the tesla factory gigafactory 1 and gigafactory 2 we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations at numerous 

 

 

jurisdictional levels in the u  s  and abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials the costs of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws may be significant we may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities which would hinder our operation of these facilities such costs and delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results furthermore any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties remediation costs third party damages or a suspension or cessation of our operations 

our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities 

it is common for employees at companies with significant manufacturing operations such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the us mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory the united automobile workers has publicly announced a desire to organize the tesla factory and has been engaged in a campaign against the company furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition

our products and services are subject to substantial regulations which are evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results 

motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture import sale and service of automobiles internationally for example in countries outside of the us we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emissions among other things that are often materially different from requirements in the us thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries this process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements

additionally our vehicles are equipped with a suite of driverassistance features called autopilot which help assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but require drivers to remain engaged there is a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and availability any of which could adversely affect our business

moreover as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by thirdparty owned systems for example existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit utilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with their solar energy systems charge fees and penalties to our customers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate designs such that the price of our solar products may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict us and our customers from transacting under our ppas or qualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering if such regulations and policies remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions or if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection of our solar and energy storage systems to the grid are introduced modified or eliminated they could deter potential customers from 

 

 

purchasing our solar and energy storage products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws 

our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages and other costs we may also incur substantial expenses and costs in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws for example commencing in may 2018 the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” will fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the european union the gdpr will create new compliance obligations and will significantly increase fines for noncompliance although we take steps to protect the security of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand

we may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance 

any product recall including for solar or charging equipment in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition for example certain limited vehicle recalls that we initiated in the past two years have resulted from a component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged a concern with the firmware in the restraints control module in certain righthanddrive vehicles industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier a front seat belt issue in a single field vehicle and model x seat components that could cause unintended seat movement during a collision furthermore testing of our vehicles by government regulators or industry groups may require us to initiate vehicle recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our vehicles in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that we have provided to other vehicle oems including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

our resale value guarantee and leasing programs for our vehicles expose us to the risk that the resale values of vehicles returned to us are lower than our estimates and may result in lower revenues gross margin profitability and liquidity 

we have provided resale value guarantees to many of our customers under which such customers may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined resale values if the resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than our estimates our profitability andor liquidity could be negatively impacted

we have applied lease accounting on leases made directly by us and prior to 2018 on all leases made by our leasing partners and sales by us of vehicles with a resale value guarantee under lease accounting we recognize the associated revenues and costs of the vehicle sale over time rather than fully upfront at vehicle delivery as a result these programs generate lower revenues in the period the car is delivered and higher gross margins during the period of the resale value guarantee as compared to purchases in which the resale value guarantee does not apply a higher than anticipated prevalence of these programs could therefore have an adverse impact on our near term revenues and operating results moreover unlike the sale of a vehicle with a resale value guarantee or programs with leasing partners which do not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery under a lease held directly by us we may receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease to the extent we expand our leasing program without securing 

 

 

external financing or business partners to support such expansion our cash flow and liquidity could also be negatively impacted 

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance 

subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system battery and drive unit we provide four year or 50000 mile limited warranties for the purchasers of new model 3 model s and model x vehicles and either a four year or 50000 mile limited warranty or a two year or 100000 mile limited warranty for the purchasers of used model s or model x vehicles certified and sold by us the limited warranty for the battery and drive unit for new model s and model x vehicles covers the drive unit for eight years as well as the battery for a period of eight years or for certain older vehicles 125000 miles if reached sooner than eight years although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranties or extended service plans the limited warranty for used model s and model x vehicles does not extend or otherwise alter the terms of the original battery and drive unit limited warranty for such used vehicles specified in their original new vehicle limited warranty for the battery and drive unit on our current new model 3 vehicles we offer an eight year or 100000 mile limited warranty for our standard range battery and an eight year or 120000 mile limited warranty for our long range battery with minimum 70 retention of battery capacity over the warranty period in addition customers of new model s and model x vehicles have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicles to cover additional services for up to an additional four years or 50000 miles provided it is purchased within a specified period of time 

for energy storage products we provide limited warranties against defects and to guarantee minimum energy retention levels for example we guarantee that each powerwall 2 product will maintain at least 7080 of its stated energy capacity after 10 years and that each powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in each of its first 10 to 15 years of use for our solar roof we offer a warranty on the glass tiles for the lifetime of a customer’s home and a separate warranty for the energy generation capability of the solar tiles we also offer extended warranties availability guarantees and capacity guarantees for periods of up to 20 years at an additional cost at the time of purchase as well as workmanship warranties to customers who elect to have us install their systems

finally customers who buy energy from us under solar energy system leases or ppas are covered by warranties equal to the length of the agreement term which is typically 20 years systems purchased for cash are covered by a warranty of up to 10 years with extended warranties available at additional cost in addition we pass through to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers’ warranties which generally range from 5 to 25 years subjecting us to the risk that the manufacturers may later cease operations or fail to honor their underlying warranties finally we provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their lease

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as model 3 and solar roof that are new andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future 

we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed to protect our systems against breaches and cyberattacks if these efforts are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results and reputation could be harmed 

we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems to assist us in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the us and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management 

 

 

financial tax and regulatory compliance systems the implementation maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes these risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations we also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against system security risks data breaches and cyberattacks 

we cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded as planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results moreover our proprietary information could be compromised and our reputation may be adversely affected if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions

our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks

we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of god and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage as a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to fluctuations in our operating costs

we expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we among other things ramp up the production of model 3 expand gigafactory 1 open new tesla stores and service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities open new supercharger locations ramp production at gigafactory 2 increase our sales and marketing activities and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations moreover we expect to continue to design develop and manufacture new and future products and increase our production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the shortterm are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time

any unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business

our vehicles contain complex information technology systems for example our vehicles are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of our vehicles we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our vehicles and their systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks vehicles and systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle we encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our vehicles via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerabilities accordingly we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful

 

 

any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles their systems or data are capable of being “hacked” could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have been the subject of such reports in the past 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness

as of december 31 2017 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 1017 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note 13 convertible and longterm debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions we and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt

pursuant to their terms holders of our 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 025 convertible senior notes due 2019 125 convertible senior notes due 2021 and 2375 convertible senior notes due 2022 collectively the “tesla convertible notes” may convert their respective tesla convertible notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective tesla convertible notes under certain circumstances upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible notes we will be obligated to deliver cash andor shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such tesla convertible notes for example in june 2017 september 2017 and november 2017 pursuant to separate privately negotiated agreements we exchanged 1448 million 100 million and 120 million respectively in aggregate principal amount of the 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 for 12 million shares 01 million shares and 01 million shares respectively of our common stock moreover our subsidiary’s 275 convertible senior notes due 2018 1625 convertible senior notes due 2019 and zerocoupon convertible senior notes due 2020 collectively the “subsidiary convertible notes” are convertible into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from 30000 to 75936 per share finally holders of the tesla convertible notes and the subsidiary convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

the terms of certain of our credit facilities including our senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt in addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio as a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt 

 

 

agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it 

we may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them  our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

the design manufacture sale installation andor servicing of automobiles energy storage products and solar products is a capital intensive business until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity  the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles  energy storage products andor solar products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness we need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations ramp vehicle production continue research and development projects establish sales delivery and service centers build and deploy superchargers  expand gigafactory 1 ramp production at gigafactory 2 and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles  energy storage products and solar products we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally we use capital from thirdparty investors to enable our customers’ access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront cost the availability of this financing depends upon many factors including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry the quality and mix of our customer contracts any regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing customer contracts changes in law including tax law risks or government incentives associated with these financings and our ability to compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited number of potential investors moreover interest rates are at historically low levels if the rate of return required by investors rises as a result of a rise in interest rates it will reduce the present value of the customer payment streams underlying and therefore the total value of our financing structures increasing our cost of capital if we are unable to establish new financing funds on favorable terms for thirdparty ownership arrangements we may be unable to finance installation of our solar energy system lease or ppa customers’ systems or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be negatively impacted which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we update our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected we may have to shorten the useful lives of any equipment to be retired as a result of any such update and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial results

we have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in what we believe is state of the art tooling machinery and other manufacturing equipment for our various product lines and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful lives however manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cuttingedge equipment more quickly than expected moreover as our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase we may be able to manufacture our products using less of our installed equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched as we have increased vehicle deliveries in markets outside of the us we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro chinese yuan norwegian krone pound sterling and canadian dollar any strengthening of the us dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars as we have historically experienced in addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured 

 

 

in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact  as a result our operating results could be adversely affected 

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

we sell our vehicles directly to consumers we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the us as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model in certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses we have opened galleries which are not full retail locations

the application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so

in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws we have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model in some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model a few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate we have also filed a lawsuit in federal court in michigan challenging the constitutionality of the state’s prohibition on direct sales as applied to our business

internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs 

others including our competitors may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services in the event that we were required to take one or more such actions our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention

our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters

our corporate headquarters the tesla factory and gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active regions in northern california and nevada if major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products we may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

 

 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile

the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 38961 per share and a low of 24201 per share over the last 52 weeks the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies moreover stockholder litigation like this has been filed against us in the past while we are continuing to defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline 

we provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections regarding sales and production as well as anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes and average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions if our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly

transactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock

the conversion of some or all of the tesla convertible notes or the subsidiary convertible notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes our 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 and the subsidiary convertible notes have been historically and the other tesla convertible notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances if holders elect to convert their convertible notes we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

moreover in connection with each issuance of the tesla convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible notes we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes

elon musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings if mr musk were forced to sell these shares pursuant to a margin call that he could not avoid or satisfy such sales could cause our stock price to decline

certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to elon musk our chief executive officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third party participants in such offerings and placements we are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by 

 

 

mr musk if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially and mr musk were unable to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged shares mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further 

antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and other provisions of delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations in addition the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

proceedings related to us treasury

in july 2012 solarcity corporation “solarcity” along with other companies in the solar energy industry received a subpoena from the us treasury department’s office of the inspector general to deliver certain documents in solarcity’s possession that relate to solarcity’s applications for us treasury grants in february 2013 two financing funds affiliated with solarcity filed a lawsuit in the us court of federal claims against the us government seeking to recover 140 million that the us treasury was obligated to pay but failed to pay under section 1603 of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 in february 2016 the us government filed a motion seeking leave to assert a counterclaim against the two plaintiff funds on the grounds that the us government in fact paid them more not less than they were entitled to as a matter of law in september 2017 solarcity and the us government reached a global settlement of both the investigation and solarcity’s lawsuit in that settlement solarcity admitted no wrongdoing and agreed to return approximately 5 of the us treasury cash grants it had received between 2009 and 2013 amounting to 295 million the investigation is now closed and solarcity’s lawsuit has been dismissed

on march 28 2014 a purported stockholder class action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of california against solarcity and two of its officers the complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of solarcity’s securities from march 6 2013 to march 18 2014 after a series of amendments to the original complaint the district court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in our favor on august 9 2016 the plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal on december 4 2017 the court heard oral argument on plaintiffs’ notice of appeal from the dismissal we believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit and appeal vigorously we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit

on august 15 2016 a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the northern district of california against solarcity two of its officers and a former officer on march 20 2017 the purported stockholder class filed a consolidated complaint that includes the original matter in the same court against solarcity one of its officers and three former officers as consolidated the complaint alleges that solarcity made projections of future sales and installations that it failed to achieve and that these projections were fraudulent when made the suit claimed violations of federal securities laws and sought unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of solarcity’s securities from may 6 2015 to may 9 2016 on july 25 2017 the court took solarcity’s fullybriefed motion to dismiss under submission on august 11 2017 the court granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend on september 11 2017 after lead plaintiff determined he would not amend the court dismissed the action with prejudice and entered judgment in favor of solarcity and the individual defendants

securities litigation relating to the solarcity acquisition

between september 1 2016 and october 5 2016 seven lawsuits were filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware by purported stockholders of tesla challenging our acquisition of solarcity following consolidation the lawsuit names as defendants the members of tesla’s board of directors and alleges among other things that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition the complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks among other relief unspecified monetary damages attorneys’ fees and costs on january 27 2017 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint rather than respond to the defendants’ motion the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on march 17 2017 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on december 13 2017 the court heard oral argument on 

 

 

the motion and reserved decision these same plaintiffs filed a parallel action in the u  s  district court for the district of delaware on april 21 2017 adding claims for violations of the federal securities laws

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

overview and 2017 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products we also offer maintenance installation operation and other services related to our products

automotive

our production vehicle fleet includes our model s premium sedan and our model x sport utility vehicle which are our highestperformance vehicles and our model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market which we began to produce and deliver in the second half of 2017 we continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced autopilot options internet connectivity and free overtheair software updates to provide additional safety convenience and performance features in addition we have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline including those we unveiled in 2017 – an electric semitruck and a new version of the tesla roadster 

in 2017 our vehicle production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies and vehicle production volume increased by 20 yearoveryear additionally we delivered 101420 model s and model x vehicles and 1764 model 3 vehicles in 2017

energy generation and storage

we lease and sell solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers we have partnered with panasonic to provide capital and operational support to manufacture pv cells thus enabling high volume integrated tile and pv cell production at our gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york we also recently commenced solar roof production at gigafactory 2 our energy storage products which we manufacture at gigafactory 1 consist of powerwall mostly for residential applications and powerpack for commercial industrial and utilityscale applications

in late 2017 we completed installation of the largest battery in the world in south australia this battery delivers electricity during peak hours to help maintain the reliable operation of south australia’s electrical infrastructure 

in 2017 we deployed 358 mwh of energy storage products and 523 mw of solar energy generation

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2018 outlook

automotive demand production and deliveries

we drive demand for our vehicles by continually improving our vehicles through overtheair software updates expanding our retail service and charging infrastructure and by periodically developing and introducing new passenger and commercial electric vehicle variants and models our goal is to become the best manufacturer in the automotive industry and having cutting edge robotic expertise inhouse is at the core of that goal our recent acquisitions of advanced automation companies have added to our talent base and are helping us increase vehicle production rates more effectively

the worldwide automotive market for alternative fuel vehicles and selfdriving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so many companies including established automakers have announced plans to expand and in some cases fully transition to production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles and to also develop selfdriving technologies we welcome the acceleration of the world’s transition to sustainable transport nonetheless we believe that the unique features of our vehicles our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with model 3 our global supercharger network and our future vehicles will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets 

 

 

we expect model s and model x deliveries to be approximately 100000 in total in 2018  constrained by the supply of cells with the 18650 form factor used in those vehicles  as our sales network continues to expand to new markets in 2018 we believe vehicle orders should continue to grow  with demand outpacing production we plan to optimize the trim and option mix in order to optimize revenue and gross margin w e have made significant and sustained progress in the production processes of model s and model x  and we will continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies for these vehicles in 2018 

we expect model 3 production and deliveries to grow significantly in 2018 the initial phase of manufacturing any new vehicle is always challenging and the model 3 production ramp has been no exception particularly given our focus on highly automated manufacturing processes that we expect will ultimately result in higher volumes at significantly lower costs model 3 volume production has been less than we initially anticipated due to production bottlenecks with the battery module assembly line at gigafactory 1 being the primary production constraint to date although future bottlenecks in other areas of vehicle manufacturing may surface we have redirected our best engineering talent to gigafactory 1 to finetune the automated processes and related robotic programming not only to address the challenges we have experienced but also to continue evaluating our overall manufacturing process for efficiencies

based on our current progress we are targeting a production rate of 2500 model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5000 model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter it is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them our prior experience on the model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time we are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints and these actions should result in our model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018 in some cases we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines which may take us longer than anticipated in order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5000 units per week run rate

we are also making strides in other aspects of our vehicle production deliveries and customer infrastructure for example we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles due to economies of scale material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing and equipment utilization we have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control for model s and model x we have also seen improved product reliability in our vehicles batteries and drive units likewise we may experience infrastructure constraints and customer experience issues relating to vehicle deliveries but are trying to address such issues by opening additional delivery and service centers to scale the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver generally as sales of tesla vehicles ramp in 2018 we plan to continue to open new tesla retail locations service centers and delivery hubs around the world we plan continue to expand our mobile repair services and we plan to significantly increase the number of superchargers and destination charging connectors globally with the goal of remaining ahead of the model 3 ramp

we are also making progress with our selfdriving technology an overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software has been completed which has enabled a stepchange improvement in the collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine learning capabilities the aggregate of such data and learnings which we refer to as our “neural net” is able to collect and analyze more highquality data than ever before enabling us to rollout a series of new autopilot features in 2018 and beyond

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment

we are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products including by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling these products in tesla stores with dedicated energy product sales personnel and leveraging channel partnerships moreover we have deemphasized absolute volume growth for our solar products and we have instead prioritized projects for cash generation and profitability solar roof installations will initially ramp slowly in the first half of 2018 as solar roof is truly the firstofitskind and there is significant complexity in both its manufacturing and installation we are deliberately ramping production at a gradual pace to 

 

 

ensure reliability and a great customer experience with demand outpacing production we expect our backlog to remain in excess of one year for the next several quarters 

we expect energy storage products to experience significant growth with our aim being to at least triple our sales in 2018 we are ramping up production for these products at our gigafactory 1 over the next several quarters but demand is greater than our current production capacity for energy storage 

we expect energy generation and storage gross margin to improve significantly in 2018 as we enter the year with a backlog of highermargin commercial solar projects and a more profitable energy storage business due to overall cost and manufacturing efficiencies from scaling

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses

capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017 with the majority of the spending to support increases in model 3 production capacity at gigafactory 1 and the tesla factory and for building additional stores service centers and superchargers

we expect operating expenses to grow in 2018 as compared to 2017 although operating expenses should decrease significantly as a percentage of revenue due to the significant increase in expected revenue in 2018 and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency the growth in operating expense will mainly be driven by engineering design and testing of new products or changes to existing products and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence in addition we expect operating expenses to increase as a result of increased selling general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy generation and storage business

we are seeking stockholder approval for a new 10year ceo performance award for elon musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones if tesla stockholders approve the award we would incur significant additional stockbased compensation expense over the term of the award as each performance milestone becomes probable of vesting

automotive financing options

we offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all direct customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners subsequent to june 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following december 31 2017 totaled  3757 million in value

we plan to adopt the new revenue recognition standard asc 606 effective january 1 2018 this will impact the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners which now will qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return in addition for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018 we will cease recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach

vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows through 2017 we only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially

we currently offer vehicle leases in the us for model s and model x directly from tesla finance our captive financing entity as well as through leasing partners leasing through tesla finance is available in 39 states and the district of columbia we also offer financing arrangements through our entities in canada germany and the 

 

 

united kingdom leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk  in addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities  we assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our financing offerings including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them and to support the overall financing needs of our customers to the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

energy generation and storage financing options

we offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements these contractual arrangements include longterm leases and power purchase agreements in both structures we install our solar energy systems at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee in the lease structure this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee in the power purchase agreement structure we charge customers a fee per kilowatthour or kwh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces the leases and power purchase agreements are typically for 20 years with a renewal option and generally when there is no upfront prepayment the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations

for customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems we also offer solar loans whereby a thirdparty lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed installed and serviced by us we enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer separately the customer enters into a loan agreement with a thirdparty lender who finances the full purchase price we are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the thirdparty lender and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan 

gigafactory 1

we continue to develop gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products we also continue to invest in the future expansion of gigafactory 1 and in production equipment for battery cell module and pack production 

panasonic has partnered with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices as these terms convey to us the right to use as defined in asc 840 leases  their production equipment we consider them to be leased assets when production commences this results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations for all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory 1 we will apply similar accounting during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded 4733 million on the consolidated balance sheet

while we currently believe that our progress at gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp for example we have experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at gigafactory 1 which has negatively affected our production of model 3 while we continue to make progress to resolve such issues at gigafactory 1 given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate

gigafactory 2

we have an agreement with the suny foundation for the construction of a factory capable of producing at least 10 gigawatts of solar cells annually in buffalo new york referred to as gigafactory 2 in december 2016 we entered into an agreement with panasonic under which it will manufacture custom pv cells and modules for us primarily at gigafactory 2 and we will purchase certain quantities of pv cells and modules from panasonic during the 10year term

 

 

the terms of our agreement with the suny foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants and any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the suny foundation and result in termination of the agreement although we remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 2 our expectations as to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits 

other manufacturing

in addition we continue to expand production capacity at our tesla factory and are exploring additional production capacity in asia and europe

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

we recognize revenue for products and services when i a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured

automotive segment

automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including free internet connectivity free access to our supercharger network and future free overtheair software updates these other elements are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free fouryear period if we sell a deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available at the time of revenue recognition we record a reserve against revenue for estimated future product returns such estimates are based on historical experience and were immaterial in all periods presented in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing would be recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue in accordance with asc 60550 customer payments and incentives 

automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees see “vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee” “vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee” and “direct vehicle leasing program” for further details

service and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services service plans merchandise sales of used tesla vehicles sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and sales of nontesla vehicle tradeins

 

 

vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee 

prior to june 30 2016 we offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all customers who purchased vehicles and who financed their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners since june 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets under this program customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a determined resale value although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee

we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain leasing partners as we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to endcustomers we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under asc 840 under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantees for the longterm portion and deferred revenue for the current portion we accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue in cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue

on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values

direct vehicle leasing program

we offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the north america and europe qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue

 

 

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles which includes plans covering maintenance for up to four years or up to 50000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods

energy generation and storage segment

for solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full purchase price either directly or through the solar loan program revenue is recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met in instances where there are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement we allocate the arrangement consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative selling price method costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as workinprogress in the consolidated balance sheet however any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against energy generation and storage revenue in accordance with asc 60550 customer payments and incentives  revenue from an energy storage product sale is recognized when the product has been delivered installed and accepted by the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for solar energy systems including energy storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met for incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by the system we record revenue as the amounts are earned the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under ppas we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for in substance as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which are recognized as revenue over the lease term as well as the fees charged for remote monitoring service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term

we capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or ppas ie the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or ppa

inventory valuation

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff

 

 

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results

warranties

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy products we sell in addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenue

stockbased compensation

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock options and espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense

income taxes

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and 

 

 

administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2017 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities the tax act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets

in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date since the tax act was enacted late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting of deferred tax remeasurements and other items such as state tax considerations to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 we do not expect any subsequent adjustments to have any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity “vie” of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not 

 

 

considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation 

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value “hlbv” method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties the thirdparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets

business combinations

we account for business acquisitions under asc 805 business combinations  the total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date we recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed we recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests we include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date

when determining such fair values we make significant estimates and assumptions critical estimates include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from our estimates furthermore our estimates might change as additional information becomes available as more fully discussed in note 3 business combinations  included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

2017 compared to 2016 

cost of automotive sales revenues increased 246 billion or 58 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to a 58 increase in vehicle deliveries resulting from increased sales of model s and model x as well as the commencement of deliveries of model 3 in the third quarter of 2017

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2262 million or 47 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million in cost of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and the expiration of resale value guarantees

cost of services and other revenue increased 7566 million or 160 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sales due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow

gross margin for total automotive decreased from 25 to 23 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the commencement of deliveries of model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the full operating costs and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volumes as production ramps higher current period early payoffs and expirations of resale value guarantees as compared to the same period in the prior year contributed to the lower gross margin lower material and manufacturing costs for model s and model x as we further improved our vehicle production processes and the partial recognition of autopilot 20 revenue in the current period partially offset the overall decrease

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment decreased from 23 to 19 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 these decreases are driven by the factors impacting gross margin for total automotive as explained above as well as higher costs of maintenance service

2016 compared to 2015 

cost of automotive revenues increased 163 billion or 62 to 427 billion during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily due to a 55 increase in vehicle deliveries as a result of a fullyear of model x deliveries as well as increased deliveries for model s in addition the increase is due to product mix as model x has a higher cost structure than model s the increase in cost of automotive revenue is partially offset by a reduction of warranty expense of 200 million resulting from better vehicle reliability 

 

 

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2986 million or 163 to 4820 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase is primarily due to an 83 increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized 1143 million in cost of automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees

gross profit for total automotive  services and other segment increased from 9213 million for the year ended december 31 2015 to 160 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment increased from 229 for the year ended december 31 2015 to 234 for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to lower material and manufacturing costs as we further improve our production processes partially offset by a negative impact from the movement in foreign exchange and increased expenditures to build out our service centers and provide maintenance

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct material and labor costs overhead of solar energy systems and energy storage products and the depreciation expense and maintenance costs associated with leased solar energy systems

2017 compared to 2016 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 6962 million or 390 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity on november 21 2016

gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 2 to 22 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue and costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity

selling general and administrative expense

 



 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements

sga expenses increased 104 billion or 73 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily due to a 5240 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotive and energy generation and storage businesses and a 649 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants additionally the increase was due to a 3106 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated expenses to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and a 1406 million increase in professional and outside service expenses to support the growth of our business

sga expenses increased 5100 million or 55 to 143 billion during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in sga expenses was primarily due to a 2472 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 61 increase in headcount as we expanded our business in the us and internationally a 910 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and a 581 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to increased number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and existing employees the increase includes 743 million related to solarcity

 

 

interest expense 

 



 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 2724 million or 137 from the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of interest expense from solarcity of 1855 million for the year ended december 31 2017 in addition our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the prior year mainly due to the convertible senior notes due in 2022 and the senior notes due in 2025 both of which we issued during 2017

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 800 million or 67 from the year ended december 31 2015 the increase as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 consisted primarily of a 331 million increase in interest expense on vehicles sales that we account for as collateralized borrowing a 285 million increase in interest expense on buildtosuit leases and a 220 million increase in interest expense associated with solarcity’s indebtedness financing obligations and capital lease obligations

other income expense net

 



 

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates additionally other income expense net includes a gain from the acquisition of solarcity for the year ended december 31 2016

other income expense net decreased by 2367 million or 213 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease was primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of solarcity and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

other income net increased by 1529 million as we recognized a gain from the acquisition of solarcity of 887 million and a loss on conversion of our 150 convertible senior notes due in 2018 of 72 million the remainder of the change in other income expense net was primarily result of fluctuations in gains losses from foreign currency exchange

provision for income taxes

 



 

our provision for income taxes increased by 49 million or 18 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily due to the increase in vehicle deliveries in foreign tax jurisdictions partially offset by 105 million of future us alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of the tax act which previously had an associated valuation allowance

 

 

our provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 was 267 million and 130 million respectively this increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements

 

 

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2017 we had 337 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 5215 million and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euros and norwegian kroner our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings

our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects investments in tooling and manufacturing equipment for the production ramp of model 3 the continued construction of gigafactory 1 and the continued expansion of our retail stores service centers mobile repair services and supercharger network we are growing our vehicle manufacturing capacity primarily to fulfill model 3 production at 5000 vehicles per week and in a later phase to 10000 vehicles per week capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017 we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business

we have an agreement to spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following full production at gigafactory 2 we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at gigafactory 2 and other operations within the state of new york and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings stores service centers delivery centers and supercharger network we may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected

in addition we had 204 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown for details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to note 13 convertible and longterm debt obligations  and note 18 vie arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

summary of cash flows

 

 



cash flows from operating activities

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales lease payments directly from customers customer deposits sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our 

 

 

payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings 

net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31 2017 decreased by 632 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 1973 million partially offset by the decrease in net loss excluding noncash expenses and gains of 1341 million the decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster processing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of 7730 million the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 7506 million as our business expanded the increase in resale value guarantees of 3269 million and deferred revenue of 3830 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the increase in customer deposits of 3884 million primarily due to model 3 reservations these increases were partially offset by the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of 247 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of 8887 million and the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of 157 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee these increases were partially offset by the increase in resale value guarantees of 4423 million and deferred revenue of 3222 million as the number vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased

foreign currency risk

we transact business globally in multiple currencies our foreign operations expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and against the us dollar upon consolidation as foreign currency exchange rates vary revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of our monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany balances as of december 31 2017 our largest foreign currency exposures were from the euro canadian dollar and norwegian krone

 

 

we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm these reasonably possible adverse changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as of december 31  2017 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income loss before income taxes these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of 1160 million 

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes a hypothetical 10 change in our interest rates would have increased our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017 by 76 million

technology 

vehicles

our core competencies are powertrain engineering vehicle engineering innovative manufacturing and energy storage our core intellectual property resides not only within our electric powertrain but also within our ability to design a vehicle that utilizes the unique advantages of an electric powertrain and the latest advancements in consumer technologies our powertrain consists of our battery pack power electronics motor gearbox and control software we offer several powertrain variants for the model s and model x that incorporate years of research and development in addition we have designed our vehicles to incorporate the latest advances in consumer technologies such as mobile computing sensing displays and connectivity further evolution of our technology continues for model 3 and future vehicles in addition advancements in battery architecture thermal management and power electronics that were originally commercialized in our vehicles are now being leveraged in our energy storage products

battery pack

we design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety reliability and long life our proprietary technology includes systems for high density energy storage cooling safety charge balancing structural durability and electronics management we have also pioneered advanced manufacturing techniques to manufacture large volumes of battery packs with high quality and low costs

we have significant expertise in the safety and management systems needed to use lithiumion cells in the automotive environment and have actively worked with lithiumion cell suppliers to further optimize cell designs to increase overall performance these advancements have enabled us to improve cost and performance of our batteries over time for example we recently upgraded the battery of our highest range model s to 100 kwh

 

 

our engineering and manufacturing efforts have been performed with a longerterm goal of building a foundation for further development for instance we have designed our battery pack to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry and form factor in so doing we can leverage the substantial investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve cost we maintain extensive testing and rd capabilities at the individual cell level the full batterypack level and other critical battery pack systems as a result we have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithiumion cell vendors chemistry types and performance characteristics we believe that the flexibility of our designs combined with our research and realworld performance data will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles 

power electronics

the power electronics in our electric vehicle powertrain govern the flow of high voltage electrical current throughout the vehicle the power electronics have two primary functions powering our electric motor to generate torque while driving and delivering energy into the battery pack while charging

the first function is accomplished through the drive inverter which converts direct current dc from the battery pack into alternating current ac to drive our induction motors the drive inverter also provides “regenerative braking” functionality which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack tesla has developed a family of drive inverter designs that are customized to our proprietary motor designs to most efficiently meet the demands of each of our vehicles the primary technological advantages to our designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package

the second function charging the battery pack is accomplished by the charger which converts alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this charger from a common household outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses tesla vehicles come with a universal mobile connector that allows for multiple different charging services to be used we also offer a tesla wall connector that can be set up to provide higher power charging than the universal mobile connectors 

on the road customers can also charge using our supercharger network or at a variety of destinations that have deployed our charging equipment in addition our vehicles can charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world either natively or through a suite of adapters this flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home

dual motor powertrain

in october 2014 we launched the initial version of our dual motor powertrain which uses two electric motors to provide greater efficiency performance and range in an allwheel drive configuration conventional allwheel drive vehicles distribute power to the wheels from a single engine driving a complex mechanical transmission system by contrast tesla’s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels the almost instantaneous response of the motors combined with low centers of gravity provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control

vehicle control and infotainment software

the performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software there are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors the flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in an automobile for example software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the “creep” feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator similar algorithms control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions we develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally

 

 

autopilot systems 

we have developed an expertise in vehicle autopilot systems including autosteering traffic aware cruise control lane changing automated parking and summon and driver warning systems in october 2014 we began equipping all model s vehicles with hardware to allow for the incremental introduction of autopilot technology in october 2016 we began equipping all tesla vehicles with hardware needed for full selfdriving capability including cameras that provide 360 degree visibility updated ultrasonic sensors for object detection a forwardfacing radar with enhanced processing and a powerful new onboard computer our autopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle our system provides safety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit this hardware suite along with overtheair firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard camera radar ultrasonics and gps enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance 

energy storage

we are leveraging many of the component level technologies from our vehicles to advance our energy storage products including high density energy storage cooling safety charge balancing structural durability and electronics management by taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems we are able to maximize manufacturing capacity to produce both powerwall and powerpack products additionally we are making significant strides in the area of bidirectional gridtied power electronics that enable us to interconnect our battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids while providing fastacting systems for power injection and absorption 

solar energy systems

we are continually innovating and developing new technologies to facilitate the growth of our solar energy systems business for example the solar roof is being designed to work seamlessly with tesla powerwall 2 and we have developed proprietary software to reduce system design and installation timelines and costs

design and engineering 

vehicles

we manufacture the model s and model x and certain components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards at the tesla factory we will also manufacture model 3 at the tesla factory the tesla factory contains several manufacturing operations including stamping machining casting plastics body assembly paint operations drive unit production final vehicle assembly and endofline testing in addition we manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors gearboxes and components for our vehicles at the tesla factory some major vehicle component systems are purchased from suppliers however we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at the tesla factory we machine various aluminum components at our facility in lathrop california and are nearing completion of a site expansion to include an aluminum castings operation

in some areas of the tesla factory we have designed our investments with flexibility to accommodate multiple products for example our new high volume paint shop and new stamping lines can support model s model x and model 3 our final vehicle assembly line is producing both model s and model x we also continue to make significant additional investments at the tesla factory to be able to start production and deliveries of model 3 in the second half of 2017 these investments include a new body assembly shop and model 3 final vehicle assembly

the netherlands

our european headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in amsterdam and tilburg the entities through which these facilities are operated hold the rights to manufacture and distribute all tesla products to customers in all markets outside of the united states and provide corporate oversight functions for european sales service and administrative functions our operations in tilburg include final assembly testing and quality control for vehicles delivered within the european union a parts distribution warehouse for service centers throughout europe a center for remanufacturing work and a customer service center

 

 

gigafactory 1 outside of reno nevada 

we are developing gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery material cell module and battery pack production in one location we plan to use the battery packs manufactured at gigafactory 1 for our vehicles including model 3 and energy storage products we broke ground on gigafactory 1 in june 2014 began assembling our energy storage products in the fourth quarter of 2015 and began production of lithiumion battery cells for our energy storage products in the first quarter of 2017 we also intend to manufacture model 3 drive units at gigafactory 1

gigafactory 1 is being built in phases so that tesla panasonic and other partners can begin manufacturing immediately inside the finished sections and continue to expand thereafter gigafactory 1 is currently expected to attain full production capacity by 2020 which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500000 vehicles annually as well as for the production of our energy storage products

we believe that gigafactory 1 will allow us to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs once we are in volume production with model 3 we have committed to invest heavily on capital expenditures for gigafactory 1 panasonic has agreed to partner with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells we have agreed to prepare and provide the land buildings and utilities to invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and to be responsible for the overall management of gigafactory 1

supply chain

our vehicles use thousands of purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of suppliers we have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts while we obtain components from multiple sources in some cases similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source in addition while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have currently fully qualified only one cell supplier for the battery packs we use in our production vehicles we are working to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers

we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials we believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements

energy storage

our energy storage products are manufactured at gigafactory 1 we leverage the same supply chain process and infrastructure as we use for our vehicles the battery architecture and many of the components used in our energy storage products are the same or similar to those used in our vehicles’ battery pack enabling us to take advantage of manufacturing efficiencies and supply chain economies of scale the power electronics and gridtie inverter for the powerwall and powerpack systems are also manufactured at gigafactory 1 allowing us to ship deploymentready systems directly from gigafactory 1

solar energy systems

we currently purchase major components such as solar panels and inverters directly from multiple manufacturers we typically purchase solar panels and inverters on an asneeded basis from our suppliers at thenprevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued under our master contractual arrangements in december 2016 we entered into a longterm agreement with panasonic to manufacture photovoltaic pv cells at our gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york with negotiated pricing provisions and the intent to manufacture 1 gigawatt of solar panels annually 

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

vehicles

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives

we have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority caeatfa that provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of model s model x model 3 and future electric vehicles and expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in california we estimate the combined tax savings under these agreements will be approximately 198 million of which 100 million has been realized as of december 31 2016

 

 

nevada tax incentives 

in connection with the construction of gigafactory 1 in nevada we have entered into agreements with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that will provide abatements for sales and use taxes real and personal property taxes and employer excise taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits these incentives are available for the applicable periods ending on june 30 2034 subject to capital investments by tesla and its partners for gigafactory 1 of at least 35 billion in the aggregate on or before june 30 2024 and certain other conditions specified in the agreements if we do not satisfy one or more conditions under the agreements tesla will be required to repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of the tax incentives incurred plus interest

tesla regulatory credits

in connection with the production delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles charging infrastructure and solar systems in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits we have sold these credits and will continue to sell future credits to automotive companies and regulated entities for example under california’s zeroemission vehicle regulation and those of states that have adopted california’s standard vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements these laws provide that automakers may bank excess credits referred to as zev credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell their credits to other regulated parties pursuant to the us environmental protection agency’s epa national greenhouse gas ghg emission standards and similar standards adopted by the canadian government car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average carbon dioxide emissions standards manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can use the credits to comply with these regulatory requirements many us states have also adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production these requirements enable companies deploying solar energy to earn tradable credits known as solar renewable energy certificates srecs

regulation—vehicle safety and testing

our vehicles are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by nhtsa including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss model s and model x fully comply with all fmvsss without the need for any exemptions and we expect future tesla vehicles to also fully comply

as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable fmvss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the united states numerous fmvss apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements we are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by nhtsa including the cafe standards theft prevention act requirements consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted

our vehicles sold in outside of the us are subject to foreign safety testing regulations many of those regulations are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the united states and may require redesign andor retesting

regulation—battery safety and testing

our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation the regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation such as by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations

we use lithium metal oxide cells in our high voltage battery packs the cells do not contain any lead mercury cadmium other hazardous materials heavy metals or toxic materials our battery packs include certain packaging materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs 

 

 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation 

state laws regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state as we open additional tesla stores and service centers we secure dealer licenses or their equivalent and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers a few states such as michigan and connecticut do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet phone or mail in such states we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and are not retail locations

as we expand our retail footprint in the united states some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations we expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model in addition we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations and we intend to actively fight any such efforts to limit our ability to sell our own vehicles

while we have analyzed the principal laws in the us eu china japan uk and australia relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis of all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in certain jurisdictions that may restrict our sales and service operations

energy storage

the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development nevertheless there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local level that support the adoption of energy storage for example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 30 tax credit under section 48a3 of the internal revenue code or the irc as described below in addition california and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets in 2011 and 2013 ferc removed many barriers for systems like energy storage to provide frequency regulation service thus increasing the value these systems can obtain in wholesale energy markets more recently in late 2016 ferc released a notice of proposed rulemaking that if it becomes a final rule would further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets finally in january 2017 ferc issued a statement supporting the use of energy storage as both electric transmission and as electric generation concurrently thus enabling energy storage systems to provide greater value to the electric grid

solar energy systems

government and utility programs and incentives

us federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates 

the federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit or federal itc under two sections of the irc section 48 and section 25d section 48a3 of the irc allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar energy system that commences construction by december 31 2019 the credit then declines to 26 in 2020 22 in 2021 and a permanent 10 thereafter we claim the section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial projects based on ownership of the solar energy system the federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy systems section 25d of the irc allows a homeownertaxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by december 31 2019the credit then declines to 26 in 2020 and 22 in 2021 and is scheduled to expire thereafter customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash or through our solar loan are eligible to claim the section 25d investment tax credit

in addition to the federal itc many us states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentive available for solar energy systems

regulation –general

we are not a “regulated utility” in the us to operate our systems we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities in almost all cases interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been preapproved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body

 

 

sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our solarleases and solarppas face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions 

regulation – net metering

fortyone states washington dc and puerto rico have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering or net metering available to new solar customers net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their onsite solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid each of the states where we currently serve customers has adopted a net metering policy except for texas where certain individual utilities have adopted net metering or a policy similar to net metering in certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so 

regulation – mandated renewable capacity

many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production such as an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or rps or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources such as solar energy systems to prove compliance with such mandates utilities typically must surrender renewable energy certificates a solar renewable energy certificate or srec is a tradable credit that represents all of the clean energy benefits of electricity generated from a solar energy system every time a solar energy system generates 1000 kwh of electricity one srec is issued or minted by a government agency the srec can then be sold or traded separately from the energy produced generally through brokers and dealers facilitating individually negotiated bilateral arrangements 

competition 

vehicles

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future as we introduce additional lower priced vehicles such as our model 3 and as we introduce other types of vehicles

we believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to

















we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology for example model s and model x compete primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan and premium suv markets with internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers including audi bmw lexus and mercedes and model 3 will compete with small to mediumsized sedans from manufacturers including audi bmw lexus mercedes honda and toyota our vehicles also compete with vehicles propelled by alternative fuels principally electricity

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle bmw daimler nissan fiat ford general motors and mitsubishi among others have electric vehicles available today and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles including plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles

 

 

energy storage 

the market for energy storage products is also highly competitive established companies such as aes energy storage lg chem and samsung as well as various emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio there are several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems such as cells battery modules and power electronics as well as others providing integrated systems we compete with these companies on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the superior specifications of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our powerpack 2 product give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products 

solar energy systems

the primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers we compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems rather than fossil fuel based alternatives we also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services in distinct segments of solar energy and energyrelated products many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations in the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitors include vivint solar inc sunrun inc trinity solar sungevity inc and many smaller local solar companies 

intellectual property 

as part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements additionally we previously announced a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world

segment information 

we operate as two reportable segments automotive and energy generation and storage 

the automotive segment includes the design development manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles the energy generation and storage segment includes the design manufacture installation and sale or lease of stationary energy storage products and solar energy systems to residential and commercial customers or sale of electricity generated by our solar energy systems to customers

employees 

as of december 31 2016 tesla inc had 17782 fulltime employees and solarcity corporation had 12243 fulltime employees to date we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

risks related to our business and industry 

we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future significant delays or other complications in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of new vehicles and other products such as our energy storage products and the solar roof which could harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

we have experienced in the past launch manufacturing and production ramp delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models such as model s and model x and new vehicle features such as the allwheel drive dual motor drivetrain on model s and the second version of autopilot hardware for example at times since the launch of model x we encountered unanticipated challenges such as certain supply chain constraints that forced us to decrease the production of these vehicles from our initial expectations if unexpected issues arise or recur with respect to any of our production vehicles we may experience further delays in addition because our vehicle models share certain production facilities with other models the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other models

we may also experience similar delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles such as model 3 and other products such as our energy storage products and the solar roof any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of our current products or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future products including complications associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain or regulatory approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we may experience delays in realizing our projected timelines and cost and volume targets for the production  launch and ramp of our model 3 vehicle which could harm our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results

our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop manufacture market and sell the model 3 vehicle which we intend to offer at a lower price point and to produce at significantly higher volumes than our present production capabilities for the model s or model x vehicles we unveiled a prototype of model 3 in march 2016 and have announced our goal to achieve volume production and deliveries of this vehicle in the second half of 2017 

we have no experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we anticipate for model 3 and to be successful we will need to implement efficient automated and lowcost manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains necessary to support such volumes we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that model 3 is in compliance with our quality standards and applicable regulations prior to beginning mass production and delivery of the vehicles moreover our model 3 production plan will also require significant investments of cash and management resources 

our production plan for model 3 is based on many key assumptions including













 

 

if one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect our ability to successfully launch model 3 on time and at volumes and prices that are profitable as well as our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 

we may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production and delivery plans both of which could harm our business and prospects

our plans call for significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries to high volumes in a short amount of time our ability to achieve these plans will depend upon a number of factors including our ability to add production lines and capacity as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels and optimize design and production changes and our suppliers’ ability to support our needs in addition we have used and may use in the future a number of new manufacturing technologies techniques and processes for our vehicles which we must successfully introduce and scale for high volume production for example we have introduced aluminum spot welding systems and highspeed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts we have also introduced unique design features in our vehicles with different manufacturing challenges such as a 17 inch display screen dual motor drivetrain autopilot hardware and falconwing doors we have limited experience developing manufacturing selling and servicing and allocating our available resources among multiple products simultaneously if we are unable to realize our plans our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially damaged

concurrent with the significant planned increase in our vehicle production levels we will also need to continue to significantly increase deliveries of our vehicles we have limited experience in delivering a high volume of vehicles and no experience in delivering vehicles at the significantly higher volumes we anticipate for model 3 and we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans into both existing markets as well as new markets into which we expand if we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally this could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

we are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

our current products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers despite efforts to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible any significant unanticipated demand would require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time and in the past we have also replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our products moreover we have signed longterm agreements with panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier for lithiumion cells at gigafactory 1 in nevada and pv cells and panels at gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york if we encounter unexpected difficulties with key suppliers such as panasonic and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers we could experience production delays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing servicing and supporting our products 

this limited supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our products such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slowerthanplanned model s and model x ramps furthermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars governmental changes natural disasters such as the march 2011 earthquakes in japan and other factors beyond our and our suppliers’ control could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to product design changes and delays in product deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

changes in our supply chain have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost we have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made and we may experience similar cost increases in the future certain suppliers including for model x have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements additionally we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer 

 

 

we expect the foregoing discussion to apply generally to model 3 however because we plan to produce model 3 at significantly higher volumes than model s or model x the negative impact of any delays or other constraints with respect to our suppliers for model 3 could be substantially greater than any such issues experienced with respect to our products to date as some of our suppliers for our current production vehicles do not have the resources equipment or capability to provide components for the model 3 in line with our requirements we have engaged a significant number of new suppliers and such suppliers will also have to ramp to achieve our needs in a short period of time there is no assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to meet our cost quality and volume needs furthermore as the scale of our vehicle production increases we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities components at much higher volumes than we have experience with if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual production plans or capabilities or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may have to incur unexpected storage transportation and writeoff costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with model 3

our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular although we have successfully grown demand for model s and model x to date and have seen very strong initial demand for model 3 and we believe that we will be able to continue to grow demand separately for each of these vehicles and their variants there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicles will not compete with one another in the market moreover the mass market demographic which we are targeting with model 3 is larger but more competitive than for model s and model x 

if the market for electric vehicles in general and tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new rapidly evolving and could be affected by numerous external factors such as 













future problems or delays in expanding gigafactory 1 and operating it in line with our expectations could negatively affect the production and profitability of our batterybased products such as model 3 or our energy storage products

to lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume we intend to integrate the production of lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for our vehicles including model 3 and energy storage products at gigafactory 1 while gigafactory 1 began producing lithiumion cells for energy storage products in january 2017 we have no other direct experience in the production of lithiumion cells including those intended for use in vehicles although we continue to remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 1 given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of expanding and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate in order to build our model 3 vehicles at our planned volume and target gross margin we must have significant battery cell production from gigafactory 1 if we are unable to expand gigafactory 1 in a timely manner and attract hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel to work there in order to produce high volumes of quality lithiumion cells at reasonable prices our ability to supply battery packs to our vehicles especially model 3 and other batterybased products according to our schedule andor at a price that allows us to sell them at our target gross margins and in the quantities we estimate could be negatively impacted any such future problems or delays with gigafactory 1 could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

 

 

if our vehicles or other products that contain our vehicle powertrains or battery packs fail to perform as expected our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed 

if our vehicles other oems’ vehicles that contain our powertrains or our energy storage products were to contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair our ability to develop market and sell our products could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and could conceivably contain defects and errors issues experienced by customers have included those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery in the model s and the seats and doors in the model x although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our vehicles as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not be up to the satisfaction of our customers while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs powertrains vehicles and energy storage products there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to consumers 

any product defects or any other failure of our products to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays product recalls product liability claims significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects our model x vehicles have not yet been evaluated by nhtsa for a star rating under the new car assessment program and while based on our internal testing we expect to obtain comparable ratings to those achieved by model s there is no assurance this will occur

if we fail to scale our business operations and otherwise manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company especially internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our products successfully

any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we continue to expand our operations significantly especially internationally including by a planned transition to high volume vehicle production and the worldwide sales and servicing of a significantly higher number of vehicles than our current vehicle fleet in the coming years with the launch and ramp of model 3 furthermore we are developing and growing our energy storage product and solar business worldwide including in countries where we have limited or no previous operating experience in connection with our vehicle business our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully we may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to control expenses and avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs establish sufficient worldwide sales service and supercharger facilities in a timely manner adapt our products to meet local requirements implement the required infrastructure systems and processes and find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing engineering service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel 

if we are unable to continue to reduce the manufacturing costs of model s and model x or control manufacturing costs for model 3 our financial condition and operating results will suffer 

as we have gradually ramped production of model s and model x manufacturing costs per vehicle have decreased while we expect ongoing cost reductions to be realized by both us and our suppliers there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals we incur significant costs related to procuring the materials required to manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel we may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facilities such as for model 3 furthermore if we are unable to achieve production cost targets on our model x and model 3 vehicles pursuant to our plans we may not be able to meet our gross margin and other financial targets

furthermore many of the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control such as potential increases in the costs of our materials and components such as lithiumion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels if we are unable to continue to control and reduce our manufacturing costs our operating results business and prospects will be harmed 

we are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of a limited fleet of electric vehicles which currently includes the model s and model x and which will also include model 3 in the near term 

we currently generate a significant percentage of our revenues from the sale of two products model s and model x vehicles model 3 for which we are planning to achieve volume production and deliveries in second half of 2017 requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction and there is no guarantee that it will be commercially successful historically automobile customers have come to expect a variety of vehicles offered in a manufacturer’s fleet and new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently in order to meet these expectations we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models to the extent our product variety and cycles do not meet consumer expectations our future sales may be adversely affected

 

 

our vehicles and energy storage products make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns and future events may lead to additional concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications 

the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells 

while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or redesign efforts all of which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithiumion cells such as a vehicle or other fire even if such incident does not involve our vehicles could seriously harm our business

in addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at the tesla factory and plan to produce high volumes of cells and battery modules and packs at gigafactory 1 any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall moreover any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of materials in particular for lithiumion cells could harm our business

we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various materials in our business including aluminum steel lithium cobalt nickel and copper as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers the prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased production of electric vehicles and energy storage products by our competitors and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells these risks include









our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage products while we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells manufactured at our own facilities we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers in particular we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in battery packs for our current production vehicles any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs substantial increases in the prices for our materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by battery cell suppliers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results

 

 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims 

product liability claims could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected resulting in personal injury or death we also may face similar claims related to any misuse or failures of new technologies that we are pioneering including autopilot in our vehicles finally as our energy storage products and solar energy systems generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause injury to people or property a successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles and energy storage products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results in most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds not by insurance

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industries we currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from companies with new technology 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future there is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete many established and new automobile manufacturers such as bmw daimler general motors and toyota as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do and almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition upon the launch of our model 3 vehicle we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes

the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive within their markets and also compete with large utilities decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utilities or other renewable energy sources could harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults under our existing contracts moreover solar panel prices have declined and are continuing to decline as we increase our solar panel manufacturing including at gigafactory 2 future price declines may harm our ability to compete and produce solar panels at competitive prices

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industry then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially

consumers may be less likely to purchase our products now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operations will continue for many years similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts and other parties in our liquidity and longterm business prospects maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors such as our limited operating history unfamiliarity with our products competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services and our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed

 

 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores galleries service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to additional sales or installations of our products or availability of superchargers 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores galleries service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales or installations of our products this ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry into markets in which we have limited or no experience selling delivering installing andor servicing our products and which may pose legal regulatory cultural and political challenges that we have not previously encountered may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and installations and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore the increasing number of model s and model x vehicles as well as the significant increase in our vehicle fleet size that we expect from model 3 will require us to continue to increase the number of our supercharger stations significantly if we fail to do so our customers could become dissatisfied which could adversely affect sales of our vehicles we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale installation and service of our products the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of superchargers in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delays or cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our network of tesla stores galleries service centers and superchargers this could lead to a decrease in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we face risks associated with our international operations and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions and with establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business

we currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions that are subject to legal political and regulatory requirements and social and economic conditions that may be very different from those affecting us domestically additionally as part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sales service and supercharger locations internationally international expansion requires us to make significant expenditures including the establishment of local operating entities hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention these risks include conforming our products to various international regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations challenges in attracting customers foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements our ability to enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products 

if we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing programs our business may suffer 

we offer vehicle financing arrangements through our local subsidiaries in the united states canada germany and the uk including leasing directly through certain of those subsidiaries the profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk we expect the need for leasing and other financing options to be significantly higher with the volumes we expect for our vehicles in the future especially model 3 for which we also expect a higher proportion of uptake for such programs than for model s or model x if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers we may be unable to grow our sales furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties either of which may harm our business

our resale value guarantee and leasing programs for our vehicles expose us to the risk that the resale values of vehicles returned to us are lower than our estimates and may result in lower revenues gross margin profitability and liquidity 

we have provided resale value guarantees to many of our customers under which such customers may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined resale values customers can lease our vehicles through both leasing partners and from us directly through our captive finance companies the resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs may be lower than our estimates which are based on a limited secondary market for our vehicles if we incorrectly estimate the residual values of our vehicles or the volume of vehicles returned to us is higher than our estimates andor we are not able to resell them timely or at all our profitability andor liquidity could be negatively impacted in cases where customers retain their vehicles past the guarantee period our gross margin will be negatively impacted as all remaining revenues and costs related to the vehicle will be recognized at no gross profit 

 

 

we apply lease accounting on sales of vehicles with a resale value guarantee and on leases made directly by us or by our leasing partners under lease accounting we recognize the associated revenues and costs of the vehicle sale over time rather than fully upfront at vehicle delivery as a result these programs generate lower revenues in the period the car is delivered and higher gross margins during the period of the resale value guarantee as compared to purchases in which the resale value guarantee does not apply a higher than anticipated prevalence of these programs could therefore have an adverse impact on our near term revenues and operating results moreover unlike the sale of a vehicle with a resale value guarantee or programs with leasing partners which do not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery under a lease held directly by us we may receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease to the extent we expand our leasing program without securing external financing or business partners to support such expansion our cash flow and liquidity could also be negatively impacted 

the unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determinations with respect to government and economic incentives in the united states and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our products and services 

we currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the united states and abroad such incentives include among other things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes taxes on nonrecurring vehicle fees the 25 value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gaspowered vehicles notably the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of incentives that are provided to gaspowered vehicles through the oil and gas industries nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example on january 1 2016 a previously available incentive in denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired and was replaced with a newly phasedin incentive that is less generous than the incentive that it replaced moreover under current regulations a 7500 federal tax credit available in the united states for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kwh of battery capacity such as our vehicles will begin to phase out with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200000 th qualifying vehicle in the united states in addition california implemented regulations phasing out a 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for highincome consumers which became effective in march 2016 in certain circumstances there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles

in addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our installation costs cost of capital and encourage investors to invest in our solar financing funds however these incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase often without warning for example the federal government currently offers a 30 investment tax credit “itc” for the installation of solar power facilities and if installed concurrently for energy storage systems which are currently scheduled to decline to 10 and expire altogether for residential systems by january 2022 likewise in jurisdictions where net energy metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use several jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so such reductions in or termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing our cost of capital making us less competitive for potential customers and adversely impact our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar assets

moreover we and our fund investors claim the itc in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar energy systems although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower and they may do so in the future such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments or contribute additional assets to our funds or fund investors

if we are unable to integrate solarcity successfully into our business we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of solarcity 

we have devoted to date and continue to devote substantial attention and resources to integrating into our company the business and operations of solarcity which we acquired in november 2016 our company has no prior experience integrating a business of the size and scale of solarcity if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

 

 

potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following 











any failure by us to realize the expected benefits of our substantial investments and commitments with respect to the manufacture of pv cells including if we are unable to comply with the terms of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory 2 could result in negative consequences for our business

as part of our acquisition of solarcity we acquired certain pv cell manufacturing and technology assets and a buildtosuit lease arrangement with the research foundation for the state university of new york the “foundation” this agreement with the foundation provides for the construction of gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york which at full capacity we expect will be capable of producing 1 gigawatt of pv cells including for our solar roof under this agreement we are obligated to among other things employ specified minimum numbers of personnel in the state of new york during the 10year period following the arrival of manufacturing equipment the receipt of certain permits and other specified items at gigafactory 2 and spend or incur approximately 5 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following the achievement of full production output at gigafactory 2 if we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations we would be obligated to pay a “program payment” of 412 million to the foundation in such year any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts to the foundation the termination of our lease at gigafactory 2 andor the need to secure an alternative supply of pv cells for products such as our solar roof moreover if we are unable to utilize the other manufacturing and technology assets that were acquired in the solarcity acquisition in accordance with our expectations we may have to recognize accounting charges pertaining to the writeoff of such assets any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched as we have increased model s deliveries in markets outside of the united states we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro chinese yuan norwegian kroner british pound and canadian dollar any strengthening of the us dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars as we have historically experienced in addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact as a result our operating results could be adversely affected

if we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer and jeffrey b straubel our chief technical officer 

none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

 

 

key talent may leave tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive experience currently in california there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineers manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner especially to support our expansion plans and ramp to highvolume manufacture of vehicles and retain current employees additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones could have an adverse effect on our performance 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer chairman of our board of directors and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla among other commitments mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles 

we are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities 

as a manufacturing company including with respect to facilities such as the tesla factory gigafactory 1 and gigafactory 2 we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the united states and abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials the costs of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws may be significant we may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities which would hinder our operation of these facilities such costs and delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results furthermore any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties remediation costs third party damages or a suspension or cessation of our operations

our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities 

it is common for employees at companies with significant manufacturing operations such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the united states mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition

our products and services are subject to substantial regulations which are evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results 

motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the import sale and service of automobiles internationally for example in countries outside of the united states we are required to meet vehiclespecific safety standards that are often materially different from requirements in the united states thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries this process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements

additionally our vehicles are equipped with a range of autopilot features that assist drivers relieving them of certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel autopilot is a recentlyintroduced feature with which domestic and foreign regulators have limited experience any current or future proposed regulations in this area if passed could impact whether and how our customers are able to use our vehicles equipped for autopilot and which depending on the severity of the regulations could adversely affect our business

 

 

moreover as a provider of electricity generated by the solar energy systems we install for customers we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of customergenerated electricity with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by thirdparty owned systems for example existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit utilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with their solar energy systems charge fees and penalties to our customers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate designs such that the price of our solar products may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict us and our customers from transacting under our power purchase agreements or qualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering if such regulations and policies remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions or if other regulations and policies that facilitate the connection of our solar energy systems to the grid are modified or eliminated they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar energy system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws 

our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages and other costs we may also incur substantial expenses and costs in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws in particular data protection laws in the eu which are currently in a state of transition although we take steps to protect the security of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand

we may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance 

any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition for example we initiated a model s recall in november 2015 after we discovered a single field unit with a front seat belt issue and a model x recall in april 2016 after an internal test revealed unintended movement in the third row seats during a collision none of our past recalls have been related to our electric powertrain  in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that we provide to other vehicle oems including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance 

subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system battery and drive unit we provide four year or 50000 mile limited warranties for the purchasers of new model s and model x vehicles and preowned model s vehicles certified and sold by us the limited warranty for the battery and drive unit covers the drive unit for eight years as well as the battery for a period of eight years or for certain older vehicles 125000 miles if reached sooner than eight years although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranties or extended service plans in addition customers of new model s and model x vehicles have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicles to cover additional services for up to an additional four years or 50000 miles provided it is purchased within a specified period of time 

for energy storage products we provide limited warranties against defects and to guarantee certain levels of minimum energy retention for example we guarantee that each powerwall 2 product will maintain at least 7080 of its stated capacity after 10 years and that each powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in each of its first 10 years of use subject to stated throughput caps we also offer extended warranties for periods of up to 20 years at additional cost at the time of purchase including a “capacity maintenance agreement” available for the powerpack 2 as well as workmanship warranties and system availability guarantees to customers who elect to have us install their systems or perform preventative maintenance services respectively 

 

 

finally customers who buy energy from us under solar energy system leases or power purchase agreements are covered by warranties equal to the length of the agreement term which is typically 20 years systems purchased for cash are covered by a warranty of up to 10 years with extended warranties available at additional cost in addition we pass through to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers’ warranties which generally range from 5 to 25 years subjecting us to the risk that the manufacturers may later cease operations or fail to honor their underlying warranties finally we provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their lease 

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as model 3 that are new andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed to protect our systems against breaches and cyberattacks if these efforts are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results and reputation could be harmed 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems to assist us in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the united states and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems the implementation maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes these risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations we also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against system security risks data breaches and cyberattacks

we cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded as planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results moreover our proprietary information could be compromised and our reputation may be adversely affected if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions

our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks

we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of god and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage while we currently maintain general liability automobile property workers’ compensation and directors’ and officers’ insurance policies as a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to fluctuations in our operating costs

we expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we among other things design develop and manufacture model 3 energy storage and solar products and other future products increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes including ramping up the production of model s and model x expand gigafactory 1 open new tesla stores and service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities open new supercharger locations develop gigafactory 2 increase our sales and marketing activities and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the shortterm are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time

 

 

any unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business 

our vehicles contain complex information technology systems for example our vehicles are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of our vehicles we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our vehicles and their systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks vehicles and systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle we encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our vehicles via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerabilities accordingly we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful

any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles their systems or data are capable of being “hacked” could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have been the subject of such reports in the past 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness   

as of december 31 2016 we had outstanding in aggregate principal amounts 205 million of the 2018 notes 920 million of the 2019 notes and 138 billion of the 2021 notes collectively the “tesla convertible notes” in addition we have established a senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” that allows us to borrow under certain circumstances up to 12 billion as of december 31 2016 we had 969 million in borrowings under the credit facility pursuant to the credit agreement we are also party to a warehouse credit facility with lender commitments of 600 million the “warehouse facility” of which we had borrowed 390 million as of december 31 2016 moreover as of december 31 2016 our subsidiary solarcity corporation together with its subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of 36 billion including under its credit facilities the “solarcity credit facilities” such outstanding indebtedness included 364 million drawn under a secured revolving credit facility with lender commitments of 4185 million as of december 31 2016 including commitments expiring as of such date which matures in december 2017 as well as 230 million in aggregate principal amount of 275 convertible senior notes due 2018 566 million in aggregate principal amount of 1625 convertible senior notes due 2019 and 113 million in aggregate principal amount of zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2020 collectively the “solarcity convertible notes” our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions and we and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt

pursuant to their terms holders may convert their tesla convertible notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective tesla convertible notes under certain circumstances the 2018 notes have been convertible at their holders’ option during each quarter commencing with the fourth quarter of 2013 except the first quarter of 2014 upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible notes we will be obligated to make cash payments in respect of the principal amounts thereof and we may also have to deliver cash andor shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such tesla convertible notes for example as of december 31 2016 we have repaid in cash approximately 455 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2018 notes due to early conversions the solarcity convertible notes are also currently convertible into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from 30000 to 75936 per share in addition holders of the tesla convertible notes and the solarcity convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date

 

 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire  depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

the terms of our credit facility andor certain of the solarcity credit facilities contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt in addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio as a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it 

the classification of our convertible notes may have an effect on our reported financial results 

our 2018 notes and the solarcity convertible notes have been historically and our 2019 notes and 2021 notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes if such notes become convertible prior to their scheduled maturity dates we would be required to reclassify such notes and the related debt issuance costs as current liabilities and certain portions of our equity outside of equity to mezzanine equity which would have an adverse impact on our reported financial results for such quarter and could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock

we may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them  our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

the design manufacture sale installation andor servicing of automobiles energy storage products and solar products is a capital intensive business until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity  the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles  energy storage products andor solar products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness we need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects establish sales and service centers build and deploy superchargers  expand gigafactory 1 develop gigafactory 2 and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles  energy storage products and solar products we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally we use capital from thirdparty fund investors to reduce the cost of capital of our solar energy system installations improve our margins offset future reductions in government incentives and maintain the price competitiveness of our solar energy systems the availability of this taxadvantaged financing depends upon many factors including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry and the quality and mix of our customer contracts any regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing customer contracts changes in legal and tax advantages or risks or government incentives associated with these financings and our ability to compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited number of potential fund investors moreover interest rates are at historically low levels if the rate of return required by investors rises as a result of a rise in interest rates it will reduce the present value of the customer payment streams underlying and therefore the total value of our financing structures increasing our cost of capital if we are unable to establish new financing funds on favorable terms for thirdparty ownership arrangements to enable our customers’ access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront cost we may be unable to finance installation of our customers’ systems or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be negatively impacted any of which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

we sell our vehicles directly to consumers we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the united states as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model in certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses we have opened galleries which are not full retail locations

the application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so

in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws we have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model in some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills and regulations that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model a few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate we have also filed a lawsuit in federal court in michigan challenging the constitutionality of the state’s prohibition on direct sales as applied to our business

internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time 

we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs

others including our competitors may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services in the event that we were required to take one or more such actions our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention

our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters

our corporate headquarters the tesla factory and gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active regions in northern california and nevada if major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products we may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile

the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 28739 per share and a low of 17819 per share over the last 52 weeks the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies for example a shareholder litigation like this was filed against us in 2013 while the plaintiffs’ complaint was dismissed with prejudice any future shareholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources

 

 

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline 

we occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections regarding sales and production as well as anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes and average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions if our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly

transactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock

the conversion of some or all of the tesla convertible notes or the solarcity convertible notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes our 2018 notes and the solarcity convertible notes have been historically and the other tesla convertible notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances if holders elect to convert their convertible notes we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

moreover in connection with each issuance of the tesla convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible notes we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes

elon musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings if mr musk were forced to sell these shares pursuant to a margin call that he could not avoid or satisfy such sales could cause our stock price to decline

certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to elon musk our chief executive officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third party participants in such offerings and placements we are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially and mr musk were unable to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged shares mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further

antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and other provisions of delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations in addition the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview and 2016 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles as well as provide energy storage through the offering of powerpack and powerwall in addition through our acquisition of solarcity corporation we also provide solar energy systems to residential and commercial customers  

as a result of our acquisition of solarcity we have reclassified the presentation of our historic energy storage products revenue and cost of revenue from services and other to energy generation and storage 

 

automotive

we produce and sell our model s sedan and our model x sport utility vehicle we continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with allwheel drive capability autopilot options internet connectivity and free overtheair software updates starting in the fourth quarter of 2016 we introduced second generation of autopilot which has improved hardware and enhanced functionalities including better safety and performance 

in 2016 our production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies during 2016 our production volume increased by 64 yearoveryear 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we began delivering model x sport utility vehicle in 2016 we greatly ramped the production and deliveries of model x also in the first quarter of 2016 we unveiled model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market which received significant interest to date we have substantially completed the design and prototypes of model 3 and are projecting to start production and deliveries in the second half of 2017 

 

energy generation and storage 

through our acquisition of solarcity corporation or solarcity on november 21 2016 we lease and sell solar energy systems and sell renewable energy to our customers typically at prices below utility rates  our longterm agreements with our customers generate a predictable and reliable stream of cash flows the operating results of solarcity from the acquisition date of november 21 2016 through december 31 2016 are included in our consolidated statements of operations also in 2016 we introduced solar roof  which we plan to begin selling and installing later in 2017 

in addition to solar energy systems we also sell energy storage products which consists of the powerwall for residential applications and the powerpack for commercial industrial and utilityscale applications in 2016 we completed several of our gridscale energy storage projects including the southern california edison mira loma substation and the american samoa island installation 

 

 

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2017 outlook

automotive demand production and deliveries 

during 2016 we improved our existing model s sedan and model x sport utility vehicle by introducing new variants that improve range performance safety and value we introduced several new features including updating the front fascia of model s in the second quarter of 2016 to expanding offerings of our battery size to cater to a wider range of consumers we expect to introduce further new vehicle variants and overtheairfunctionality over time we also expect that the demand for our vehicles will continue to increase as we improve our vehicles and expand our retail service and charging infrastructure and as we develop new products in addition the introduction of model 3 would also generate incremental demand by offering a less expensive alternative 

during the third quarter of 2016 we discontinued our resale value guarantee program in north america the resale value guarantee was originally introduced in 2013 to help to reassure customers that tesla vehicles would retain value over time 

we continue to make progress in increasing vehicle production for the year ended december 31 2016 we produced approximately 84000 vehicles an increase of 64 from the prior year this increase was achieved despite the fact that we faced challenges in 2016 with model x production including part shortages in january 2017 we completed the acquisition of grohmann engineering gmbh a german manufacturing company with expertise in automated production we expect this acquisition will facilitate and expand vehicle production 

 

 

in the first quarter of 2016 we announced our target to increase overall vehicle production level to 500000 vehicles in 2018 increasing production will require additional capital we have started the installation of model 3 manufacturing equipment in fremont and at gigafactory 1 and we are on track to support volume production and deliveries in the second half of 2017 

in addition to expanding our vehicle production and deliveries we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles over the next several quarters due to economies of scale material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing the decreasing trend in cost of manufacturing vehicles is expected to improve total automotive gross margin over time and mitigate some of the higher ramp up costs associated with the launch of model 3 we have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control over utilization and minimization of scrapping materials this is also evident through increased product reliability including vehicle battery and drive units that resulted in a reduction of our warranty expense in addition we expect that the acquisition of grohmann will further increase our production automation and efficiency 

in order to accommodate a much larger fleet of customer vehicles as we increase deliveries and to provide timely customer service we are expanding our sales service and charging infrastructure worldwide in particular we continue to open new tesla retail and service locations around the world as of december 31 2016 we had a total of 265 sales and service locations and expect our longterm vehicle sales outside of north america to be over half of our worldwide total automotive revenue as we have less experience in international markets we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans with respect to timing and expected sales 

energy generation and storage demand 

we believe that demand for our energy products will continue to increase we plan to reduce customer acquisition costs by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling solar products in tesla stores in the fourth quarter of 2016 we revealed the solar roof product of which we expect to begin production and installation later in 2017 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2016 we also announced our second generation energy storage products powerpack 2 and powerwall 2 which offer significant price advantage per kwh and higher energy density 

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses 

 

we plan to build 500000 vehicles in 2018 given this plan we continue to invest heavily in capital expenditures our capital expenditure needs include expenditures for the tooling production equipment and construction of the model 3 production lines equipment to support cell production at the gigafactory 1 as well as new retail locations service centers and supercharger locations we expect to invest between 20 billion and 25 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of model 3 production in 2017 

as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the net book value of our supercharger network was 2072 million and 1666 million respectively and as of december 31 2016 our supercharger network included 790 locations globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to continue to be a minimal portion of total capital spending during 2017 we expect that this investment will grow our supercharger network greatly we allocate supercharger related expenses to cost of total automotive revenues and selling general and administrative expenses these costs were immaterial for all periods presented

we expect operating expenses to grow in 2017 driven by engineering design and testing expenses related to model 3 supplier contracts and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence in addition we expect operating expenses to increase as a result of the increased selling general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy generation and storage segment we expect selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue 

automotive financing options

we offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions during 2016 we discontinued the resale value guarantee in north america but continue to offer it in selected european and asian markets resale value guarantees available for exercise during fiscal year 2017 total 1795 million in value

 

 

vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially 

we currently offer vehicle leases in the us directly from tesla finance our captive financing entity as well as through a leasing partner leasing through tesla finance is now available in 39 states and the district of columbia we also offer financing arrangements through our entities in canada germany and the uk leasing through both our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our nearterm operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting in addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities but not for those offered through our leasing partner we only receive a limited portion of cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our financing offerings including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them and to support the overall financing needs of our customers to the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flow could be negatively impacted

through solarcity we offer solar loans whereby a thirdparty lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system installed by us we enter into a standard solar energy system sale agreement with the customer separately the customer enters into a loan agreement with one of the thirdparty lenders who finances the full purchase price we are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the thirdparty lender and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan if we are unable to continue to offer thirdparty financing or other financing alternatives to our customers on competitive terms our growth may slow and our financial and operating results may be adversely impacted

gigafactory 1 and manufacturing

we are developing gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules and battery packs in one location for both vehicles and energy storage products we broke ground on gigafactory 1 in june 2014 began assembling our energy storage products in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2015 and began production of lithiumion battery cells for our energy storage products in the first quarter of 2017  we continue to invest in construction of the building at gigafactory and in production equipment for battery module and pack production 

panasonic has agreed to partner with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory 1 at negotiated prices as these terms convey a right to use the production related assets as defined within asc 840 leases  we will consider these leased assets beginning with the start of cell production in early 2017 this will result in us recording the value of such assets within property plant and equipment net in our consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations for all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory 1 we will record the value of such assets on our consolidated balance sheet based on our current assessment as of december 31 2016 approximately 300 million is expected to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet during the first quarter of 2017

although we continue to remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 1 given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate in addition we continue to expand production capacity at our fremont factory and are exploring additional production capacity in asia and europe  

 

 

gigafactory 2 and manufacturing 

through our acquisition of solarcity we have an agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york for the construction of an approximately 1 million square foot manufacturing facility capable of producing 1 gigawatt of solar panels annually on an approximately 8824 acre site located in buffalo new york referred to as gigafactory 2 in december 2016 we entered into a production pricing agreement phases 13 the phase 13 agreement with panasonic corporation panasonic corporation of north america and sanyo electronic co ltd collectively panasonic this agreement provides that panasonic will manufacture custom photovoltaic pv cells and modules for us primarily at gigafactory 2 and that we will purchase certain amounts of pv cells and modules form panasonic during the 10year term with the intent to produce pv cells and modules totaling approximately 1 gigawatt annually beginning in 2019 

the terms of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york among other things require us to comply with a number of covenants during the term of the agreement any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the foundation and result in termination of the agreement although we continue to remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 2 our expectations as to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue for products and services when i a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

automotive segment

automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including free internet connectivity free access to our supercharger network and free future over the air software updates these deliverables are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year period if we sell a deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar options and other information which may be available

starting in the third quarter of 2016 we started to separately present automotive leasing revenue and related cost of revenue all prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees see “vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee” “vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee” and “direct vehicle leasing program” for further details

services and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services service plans and merchandise sales of preowned tesla vehicles sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and sales of nontesla vehicle tradeins

 

 

vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee 

we offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners subsequent to june 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets under this program customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a determined resale value guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles on our consolidated balance sheets as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases when customer retains ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive leasing revenue in cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer at an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to preowned vehicle inventory as of december 31 2016 1795 million of guarantees are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee

we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners as we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to endcustomers we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under accounting standards codification asc 840  leases  under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantee for the longterm portion and deferred revenue for the current portion we accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to leased vehicles on our consolidated balance sheets and record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenues during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue in cases where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive leasing revenue the maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program assuming we repurchase of all vehicles under this program is 8559 million at december 31 2016

as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 we had 118 billion and 5275 million of such borrowings recorded in the resale value guarantee liability and 2891 million and 1205 million recorded in deferred revenue liability

at least annually we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be significant changes to their estimated values

direct vehicle leasing program

we offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the north america and europe qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had deferred 672 million and 258 million of leaserelated upfront payments which will be recognized on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the individual leases

 

 

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations 

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods

energy generation and storage segment

for solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full purchase price either directly or through the solar loan program revenue is recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met in instances where there are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement we allocate the arrangement consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative selling price method costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as work in progress in our consolidated balance sheets however any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against solar energy systems and components sales revenue in accordance with asc 60550 customer payments and incentives  revenue for energy storage product sale is recognized when the product is delivered or installed provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for solar energy systems including energy storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met for incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by the system we record revenue as the amounts are earned the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under power purchase agreements we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for in substance as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or power purchase agreements the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased – net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or power purchase agreement 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy generation and storage products we sell at the time of delivery we accrue for a manufacturer’s warranty which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims 

 

 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserve in the future for the solar energy systems that we sell we provide a warranty on the installation and components for periods typically between 10 to 30 years the manufacturer’s warranty on the solar energy systems’ components which is typically passedthrough to customers ranges from 5 to 30 years the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as a current liability 

our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles and solar energy systems accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements any costs to repair these vehicles and systems are expensed as incurred warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue for automotive related sale and cost of energy generation and storage revenue for solar energy and storage systems

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock options and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

in august 2012 our board of directors granted 5274901 stock options to our ceo the “2012 ceo grant” the 2012 ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date 

each of the ten vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten predetermined performance milestones and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 40 billion as compared to the initial market capitalization of 32 billion measured at the time of the 2012 ceo grant 

the term of the 2012 ceo grant is ten years so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested options will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise 

we measured the fair value of the 2012 ceo grant using a monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions riskfree interest rate of 165 expected term of ten years expected volatility of 55 and dividend yield of 0

stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2012 ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met

 

 

as of december 31 2016 the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and the following performance milestones were achieved and approved by our board of directors and therefore five of ten tranches of the 2012 ceo grant were vested as of such date 











as of december 31 2016 the following performance milestones were considered probable of achievement









we expect that the next performance milestone to be achieved will be the successful completion of the model 3 beta prototype which would be achieved upon the determination by our board of directors that an eligible prototype has been completed candidates for such prototype are among the vehicles that we are currently building as part of our ongoing testing of our model 3 vehicle design and manufacturing processes

as the above four performance milestones were considered probable of achievement we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 158 million 106 million and 250 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

additionally no cash compensation has ever been received by our ceo for his services to the company

income taxes 

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the united states and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2016 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

 

 

principles of consolidation 

our consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board or fasb asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity or vie of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that solarcity enters into to finance the costs of solar energy systems under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on our consolidated balance sheets as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and distributed to the thirdparties the thirdparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in our consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of our consolidated balance sheets since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets

business combinations

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill the excess of the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities over the fair value of purchase consideration is recorded as gain from bargain purchase in other income and expense net in our consolidated statements of operations when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and certain tangible assets such as solar energy systems acquired as part of our solarcity acquisition

critical estimates in valuing certain tangible and intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

revenues 

 



 

automotive segment

automotive revenue includes revenues related to sale of new model s and model x vehicles including internet connectivity supercharger access and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for model s and model x vehicles sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting 

services and other revenue consists of sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers maintenance services and sales of preowned vehicles 

2016 compared to 2015

automotive revenue increased 216 billion or 63 to 559 billion during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily related to a 55 increase in vehicle deliveries to approximately 50700 the increase in volume is primarily due to a full year of model x deliveries in 2016 as well as increased production and sales of model s further there was an overall increase in average selling price of 61 primarily due to the introduction of model x which are higher priced vehicles compared to model s in addition there is an increase of 1334 million to 3023 million of the sale of regulatory credits from the year ended december 31 2015 to the corresponding period in 2016 these increases were partially offset by negative impact from the movement of foreign currency exchange rates 

automotive leasing revenue increased 4524 million or 146 to 7618 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily due to an 83 increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with a resale value guarantee from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized 1126 million in automotive leasing revenue upon the expiration of resale value guarantees

service and other revenue increased 1774 million or 61 to 4680 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to an increase of 1174 million in preowned vehicle sales as we received more tradeins and an increase in maintenance service revenue of 666 million as our fleet continues to grow 

2015 compared to 2014

automotive revenue during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 were 343 billion and 287 billion automotive leasing revenue during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 were 3094 million and 1326 million the increase of automotive revenue and automotive leasing revenue was primarily driven by the ramp in vehicle deliveries 

service and other revenue during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 were 2906 million and 1871 million related primarily to increases in preowned vehicle sales and maintenance service revenue

energy generation and storage segment 

energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and power purchase agreements and the sale of solar energy systems incentives 

 

 

energy generation and storage revenue increased 1669 million or 1153 primarily due to 841 million as a result of the inclusion of revenue from solarcity from the acquisition date of november 21 2016 through december 31 2016 as well as an increase of 828 million in energy storage revenue as we ramped up our energy storage sales effort and completed several utility scale projects such as southern california edison mira loma substation  

cost of revenues and gross profit 

 



 

automotive segment

cost of automotive revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand 

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and energy products costs associated with providing maintenance services  and costs to acquire and certify preowned vehicles

2016 compared to 2015

cost of automotive revenues increased 163 billion or 62 to 427 billion during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily due to a 55 increase in vehicle deliveries as a result of a full year of model x deliveries as well as increased deliveries for model s in addition the increase is due to product mix as model x has a higher cost structure than model s the increase in cost of automotive revenue is partially offset by a reduction of warranty expense of 200 million resulting from better vehicle reliability 

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2986 million or 163 to 4820 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase is primarily due to an 83 increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized 1143 million in cost of automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees

cost of services and other revenue increased 1855 million or 65 to 4725 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to an increase of 1208 million in cost of preowned vehicle sales due to increase in volume and an increase of 649 million in cost to provide maintenance service as our fleet continues to grow 

 

 

gross profit for the automotive segment increased from 9213 million for the year ended december 31 2015 to 160 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 automotive gross margin increased from 229 for the year ended december 31 2015 to 234 for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to lower material and manufacturing costs as we further improve our production processes partially offset by a negative impact from the movement in foreign exchange and increased expenditures to build out our service centers and provide maintenance 

2015 compared to 2014

cost of automotive revenues increased 5816 million or 28 to 264 billion during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in cost of automotive revenues was driven primarily by increased model s deliveries 

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 960 million or 110 to 1834 million during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the increase is primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees as volume of model s increased 

for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 costs of services and other revenue were 2869 million and 1669 million the increase in cost of services and other revenues was driven primarily by greater preowned vehicle sales and increased maintenance and repair services

gross profit for the automotive segment increased from 8815 million from the year ended december 31 2014 to 9213 million for the year ended december 31 2015 gross margin for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 were 229 and 276 the lower margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to product and regional mix shift as a greater percentage of sales were derived from vehicle models with lower average selling prices and increased manufacturing costs related to the ramp in production of the small drive unit for dual motor model s vehicles and start of model x production obsolete inventory and lower zev credits revenue this margin decrease was partially offset by an increasing amount of revenues from vehicles accounted for as leases including direct lease vehicles and those under our resale value guarantee programs which have a significantly higher gross margin and from material cost savings services and other gross margin were also down year over year primarily driven by a planned price reduction for powertrain sales to daimler

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct material and labor costs overhead of solar energy systems and energy storage products and the depreciation expense and maintenance costs associated with leased solar energy systems 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased 1660 million to 1783 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase is due to an increase of 670 million as a result of the inclusion of solarcity’s financial results from the acquisition date of november 21 2016 to december 31 2016 the remaining increase was due to increase in the sale of energy storage products and increased expenditures to increase the capacity of energy storage products 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue in 2014 was insignificant gross profit and related margin for energy generation and storage was also insignificant in all periods presented

our provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 was 267 million 130 million and 94 million the increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

 

the net loss allocation to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2016 was 981 million and was related to solarcity’s financing arrangements

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity

 

as of december 31 2016 we had 339 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents which included 22 billion of money market funds this balance included 9690 million drawn under our asset based line of credit and 3900 million drawn under our warehouse agreement which we entered into in august 2016 to support the tesla finance direct leasing program in addition the balance included 2135 million of cash assumed as part of the solarcity acquisition amounts held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 8271 million as of december 31 2016 and consisted primarily of euro chinese yuan and canadian dollars

 

sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles proceeds from retail financing activities and sales of energy generation and storage products in addition through our acquisition of solarcity we expect to generate additional liquidity through the sale of solar energy systems to customers and financing funds created to monetize the cash flows tax attributes and other incentives generated by solar energy systems deployed under operating leases or power purchase agreements we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months based on our current plans we may raise funds in the future including through potential equity or debt offerings subject to market conditions and recognizing that we cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms or at all the amount and timing of funds that we may raise is undetermined and will vary based on a number of factors including our liquidity needs as well as access to current and future sources of liquidity 

 

 

these current sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations and research and development projects the initial investments in tooling and manufacturing capital for our planned model 3 the continued construction of gigafactory 1 and the expansion of our retail stores service centers and supercharger network we are planning to produce 500000 total vehicles in 2018 which is approximately double our prior growth plan we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs we expect to invest between 20 billion and 25 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of model 3 production in 2017 

 

 

 

as part of the solarcity acquisition we have an agreement to spend or incur approximately 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following full production at gigafactory 2 we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at gigafactory 2 and other operations within the state of new york over the 10year term of the agreement and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default 

 

capital resources

 

as of december 31 2016 we have the following credit facilities available 

 





 

 

in addition as a result of the acquisition of solarcity additional credit facilities are included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016 solarcity has financing fund commitments from several fund investors that can be drawn in the future upon the achievement of specific funding criteria as of december 31 2016 solarcity had entered into 63 financing funds that had a total of 4814 million of undrawn committed capital

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

foreign currency risk 

we transact business globally in multiple currencies our international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and against the us dollar upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany balances as of december 31 2016 our largest currency exposures are from the euro japanese yen and british pounds we recorded foreign exchange gain of 261 million in other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2016 related to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 

 

 

we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies as of december 31 2016 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 416 million recorded to other income expense net principally from intercompany and cash balances 

  in november 2015 we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in japanese yen the derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes we document each hedge relationship and assess its initial effectiveness at the inception of the hedge contract and we measure its ongoing effectiveness on a quarterly basis using regression analysis during the term of an effective hedge contract we record gains and losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss we reclassify these gains or losses to costs of automotive sales in the period the related finished goods inventory is sold or over the depreciation period for those sales accounted for as leases although our contracts are considered effective hedges we may experience small amounts of ineffectiveness due to timing differences between our actual inventory purchases and the settlement date of the related foreign currency forward contracts ineffectiveness related to the hedges is immaterial as of december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 we have no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and had recorded a cumulative gain of 56 million to aoci related to our outstanding foreign currency cash flow hedges 

interest rate risk 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 34 billion as of december 31 2016 a significant portion of our cash equivalents were invested in money market funds cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash equivalents as a result of changes in interest rates due to the shortterm nature of our cash equivalents 

we are exposed to interest rate risk for our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates plus a specified margin pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on certain floatingrate debt we do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes in particular a hypothetical 10 change in our interest rates would have immaterial impact on interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016

energy storage applications 

using the energy management technologies and manufacturing processes developed for our vehicle powertrain systems we have developed energy storage products for use in homes commercial sites and utilities the applications for these battery systems include backup power peak demand reduction demand response and wholesale electric market services we began selling our home systems in 2013 and our commercial and utility systems in 2014 we recently announced the next generation of our energy storage products under the tesla energy brand

the tesla energy product portfolio will include energy storage products with a wide range of applications from use in single homes to use in larger utilityscale projects tesla powerwall is a rechargeable lithiumion battery designed to store energy at a residential and small commercial level for load shifting backup power and selfconsumption of solar power generation powerwall is available in storage sizes of 10kwh optimized for backup applications or 7kwh optimized for daily use applications in addition we offer a 100 kwh powerpack for peak shaving load shifting and demand response for commercial customers and for renewable firming and a variety of grid services for utilities for utility scale systems 100kwh battery blocks can be grouped together to offer installation of over 10mwh we began production of our tesla energy products at the gigafactory in the fourth quarter of 2015

technology

our core competencies are powertrain engineering vehicle engineering innovative manufacturing and energy storage our core intellectual property resides not only within our electric powertrain but also within our ability to design a vehicle that utilizes the unique advantages of an electric powertrain and the latest advancements in consumer technologies our powertrain consists of our battery pack power electronics motor gearbox and control software we designed our powertrain originally for our first vehicle the tesla roadster and commercialized improvements into vehicles manufactured by daimler and toyota and ultimately into the model s and model x today we offer several powertrain variants for the model s and model x that incorporate years of research and development performed since the original design in addition we have designed our vehicles to incorporate the latest advances in consumer technologies such as mobile computing sensing displays and connectivity further evolution of our technology continues for model 3 which we plan to offer at significantly lower price in addition advancements originally commercialized in our vehicles are being leveraged for our storage applications

battery pack 

we design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety reliability and long life our proprietary technology includes systems for high density energy storage cooling safety charge balancing structural durability and electronics management we have also pioneered advanced manufacturing techniques to manufacture large volumes of battery packs with high quality and low costs

we have significant expertise in the safety and management systems needed to use lithiumion cells in the automotive environment and have actively worked with lithiumion cell suppliers to further optimize cell designs to increase overall performance these advancements have enabled us to improve cost and performance of our batteries over time for example in 2015 alone we upgraded the battery of our lowest range model s from 60 kwh to 70 kwh and our highest range model s to 90 kwh

our engineering and manufacturing efforts have been performed with a longerterm goal of building a foundation for further development for instance we have designed our battery pack to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry and form factor in so doing we can leverage the substantial investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve cost we maintain extensive testing and rd capabilities at the individual cell level the full batterypack level and other critical battery pack systems as a result we have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithiumion cell vendors chemistry types and performance characteristics we believe that the flexibility of our designs combined with our research and realworld performance data will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles 

power electronics

the power electronics in our electric vehicle powertrain govern the flow of high voltage electrical current throughout the vehicle the power electronics have two primary functions powering our electric motor to generate torque while driving and delivering energy into the battery pack while charging

the first function is accomplished through the drive inverter which converts direct current dc from the battery pack into alternating current ac to drive our induction motors the drive inverter also provides “regenerative braking” functionality which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack when needed tesla has developed a family of drive inverter designs that are customized to its proprietary motor designs to most efficiently meet the demands of each of our vehicles the primary technological advantages to our designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package

the second function charging the battery pack is accomplished by the charger which converts alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this charger from a common household outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses in most markets tesla vehicles come with a mobile connector that allows for multiple different charging services to be used in many markets tesla offers a tesla wall connector that can be set up to provide higher power charging than the mobile connectors

on the road customers can also charge using our supercharger network or at a variety of destinations that have deployed our charging equipment in addition model s vehicles can charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world either natively or through a suite of adapters this flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home

dual motor powertrain

in october of 2014 we launched the initial version of our dual motor powertrain which uses two electric motors to provide greater efficiency performance and range in an allwheel drive configuration conventional allwheel drive vehicles distribute power to the wheels from a single engine driving a complex mechanical transmission system by contrast tesla’s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels the almost instantaneous response of the motors combined with low centers of gravity provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control 

vehicle control and infotainment software 

the performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software there are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors the flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle for example software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the “creep” feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator similar algorithms control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions we develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally 

autopilot systems 

we have developed an expertise in vehicle autopilot systems including autosteering traffic aware cruise control lane changing automated parking driver warning systems and automated braking functions in october of 2014 we began equipping all model s vehicles with hardware to allow for the incremental introduction of autopilot technology our autopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel although the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle our system provides safety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit our autopilot system leverages an advanced set of hardware including a forward radar a forwardlooking camera 12 longrange ultrasonic sensors and a highprecision digitally controlled electric assist braking system this hardware suite along with overtheair firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard camera radar ultrasonics and gps enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance 

vehicle design and engineering 

in addition to the design development and production of the powertrain we have created significant inhouse capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems we design and engineer bodies chassis interiors heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models 

additionally our team has expertise in lightweight materials a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range model s and model x are built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle 

vehicle sales and marketing

companyowned stores and galleries 

we market and sell cars directly to consumers through an international network of companyowned stores and galleries our tesla stores and galleries are highly visible premium outlets in major metropolitan markets some of which combine retail sales and service we have also found that opening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand as a result we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and personnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint we refer to these as “service plus” locations including all of our stores galleries service plus and service facilities we operated 208 locations around the world as of december 31 2015 

we own our sales and service network because the traditional franchised distribution and service model is not viable for a business like ours in our companyowned network our customers deal directly with our own teslaemployed sales and service staff creating a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers we believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing maintain and strengthen the tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback 

tesla supercharger network 

we are building a network of up to 120 kw fast charging equipment each called a tesla supercharger throughout north america europe and asia for fast charging of tesla vehicles our supercharger network is a strategic corporate initiative designed to remove a barrier to the broader adoption of electric vehicles caused by the perception of limited vehicle range and to provide fast charging to enable longdistance travel the tesla supercharger is an industrial grade high speed charger designed to replenish 170 miles of range in the battery pack in as little as 30 minutes supercharger stations typically have between four to ten superchargers and are strategically placed primarily along welltravelled highways to allow model s and model x owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient minimal stops as of december 31 2015 we had 584 supercharger stations open in north america europe and asia we are planning to continue to expand the supercharger network in the united states europe and asia 

destination charging

we are working with a wide variety of hospitality locations including hotels and popular destinations to offer an additional charging option for our customers these destination charging partners deploy our wall connectors and provide charging to model s owners that patronize their businesses as of december 31 2015 over 1800 locations around the world had more than 3100 tesla wall connectors installed 

orders and reservations 

we typically carry a very limited inventory of our vehicles at our tesla stores the vast majority of our customers customize their vehicle by placing an order with us via the internet to begin production or make a reservation we require an initial payment which is collected once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and has entered into a purchase agreement we require all remaining payment of the purchase price of the vehicle upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer

marketing 

our principal marketing goals are to 









historically we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles and we believe we will continue to do so to date media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs 

vehicle service and warranty

service 

we provide service for our electric vehicles at our companyowned service centers at our service plus locations or in certain areas for an additional charge through tesla ranger mobile technicians who provide services that do not require a vehicle lift we owned and operated 118 service locations as of december 31 2015 we are continuing our plan to build a number of additional service centers in several markets worldwide 

our vehicles are designed with the capability to wirelessly upload the data to us via an onboard system with cellular connectivity allowing us to diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle when maintenance or service is required a customer can schedule service by contacting one of our tesla service centers our tesla rangers or mobile service team can also perform an array of services from the convenience of a customer’s home or other remote location 

our companyowned service centers enable our technicians to work closely with our engineers and research and development teams in silicon valley to identify problems find solutions and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers 

new vehicle limited warranty maintenance and extended service plans 

we provide a four year or 50000 mile new vehicle limited warranty with every new vehicle subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery for the battery and drive unit on our current new vehicles we offer an eight year infinite mile warranty although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered

in addition to the new vehicle limited warranty we offer a comprehensive maintenance program for every new vehicle which includes plans covering prepaid maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles and an extended service plan the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery the extended service plan covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for up to an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the new vehicle limited warranty 

our new vehicle limited warranty and extended service plans are subject to certain limitations exclusions or separate warranties including on certain wear items such as tires brake pads paint and general appearance and battery performance and are intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems battery powertrain and brake system in addition all prepaid maintenance and extended service plans must be purchased within a specified period of time after vehicle purchase or warranty expiration 

financial services

we offer loans and leases for our vehicles in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we also offer financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain areas of the united states germany canada and the uk we intend to broaden our financial services offerings during the next few years 

certain of our financing programs provide customers with a resale value guarantee under which those customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us at a preset future date generally during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a predetermined resale value  this structure allows the customer to enjoy the benefits of vehicle ownership without concern for resale value we introduced this program in north america in 2013 and expanded it to selected european and apac markets in 2014 and 2015 in certain markets we also offer residual value guarantees to financial institutions which may obligate us to repurchase the vehicles for a predetermined price 

manufacturing 

we conduct vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at our facilities in fremont california lathrop california and tilburg netherlands we are also building a cell and battery manufacturing facility the tesla gigafactory outside of reno nevada 

the tesla factory in fremont ca and manufacturing facility in lathrop ca

we manufacture the model s and model x and certain components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards at the tesla factory the tesla factory contains several manufacturing operations including stamping machining casting plastics body assembly paint operations seat assembly final vehicle assembly and endofline testing in addition we manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors gearboxes and components for our vehicles at the tesla factory several major component systems of our vehicles are purchased from suppliers however we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at the tesla factory we machine various aluminum components at our facility in lathrop california and are nearing completion of a site expansion to include an aluminum castings operation

we have completed significant investments to increase our production capacity and to begin production of the model x at the tesla factory this includes the completion and launch of the first phase of a new high volume paint shop our second body assembly shop two new stamping lines a seat assembly facility and an expansion of the battery pack and drive unit production lines 

we plan to produce model s model x and model 3 at the tesla factory in some areas of the tesla factory we have designed our investments with flexibility to accommodate multiple products for example our new high volume paint shop and new stamping lines can support all three vehicles our final vehicle assembly line is producing the model s and the model x while certain powertrain components are shared between the model s and model x over the course of 2016 we plan to make significant additional investments at the tesla factory in order to be able to start production and deliveries of model 3 in late 2017 these include a new body assembly shop and model 3 final vehicle assembly

the netherlands

our european headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in amsterdam and tilburg the entities through which these facilities are operated hold the rights to manufacture and distribute all tesla products to customers in all markets outside of the united states and provide corporate oversight functions for european sales service and administrative functions our operations in tilburg include final assembly testing and quality control for vehicles delivered within the european union a parts distribution warehouse for service centers throughout europe a center for remanufacturing work and a customer service center 

the gigafactory outside of reno nevada

we are developing the gigafactory as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery material cell module and battery pack production in one location we plan to use the battery packs manufactured at the gigafactory for our vehicles and for our tesla energy applications we broke ground on the gigafactory in june 2014 and began assembling our tesla energy products in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2015 

we currently expect to produce cells at the gigafactory beginning in 2016 for use initially in our tesla energy products and later for our vehicles the gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020 which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500000 vehicles annually as well as for the production of our energy storage products by that time we expect battery pack production capacity to reach 50 gwh of this we expect to build 35 gwh of cell production capacity at the gigafactory and purchase 15 gwh of cells from other manufacturers 

we believe that the gigafactory will allow us to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs once we are in volume production with model 3 the total capital expenditures associated with the gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be 4 to 5 billion of which approximately 2 billion is expected to come from tesla panasonic has agreed to partner with us on the gigafactory with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells we have a supply agreement with panasonic that among other things allows us to purchase a minimum of 18 billion lithiumion battery cells at preferential prices that we intend to purchase from 2014 through 2017 we have agreed to prepare and provide the land buildings and utilities invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management of the gigafactory 

supply chain

our vehicles use over 3000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 350 suppliers we have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts while we obtain components from multiple sources in some cases similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source in addition while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have currently fully qualified only one cell for the battery packs we use in our production vehicles we are working to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers 

we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel cobalt nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global d emand for these materials we believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements 

governmental programs incentives and regulations

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives

we have entered into agreements in 2012 2013 and 2015 with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority caeatfa that each provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of model s model x and future electric vehicles and expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in california we estimate the combined tax savings under these agreements will be approximately 98 million of which 56 million has been realized as of december 31 2015 

nevada tax incentives

in connection with the construction of the gigafactory in nevada we have entered into agreements with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that will provide abatements for sales and use taxes real and personal property taxes and employer excise taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits these incentives will be available for the applicable periods beginning on october 17 2014 and ending on june 30 2034 subject to capital investments by tesla and its partners for the gigafactory of at least 35 billion in the aggregate on or before june 30 2024 and certain other conditions specified in the agreements if we do not satisfy one or more conditions under the agreements tesla will be required to repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of the tax incentives incurred plus interest 

tesla regulatory credits

in connection with the production delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers 

under california’s zeroemission vehicle regulations and those of states that have adopted the california standards vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in those states during each model year are zeroemission vehicles and partial zeroemission vehicles currently the states of arizona california connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new jersey new mexico new york oregon rhode island and vermont have such laws in effect these laws provide that a manufacturer may earn credits referred to as zev credits if they produce more zeroemission vehicles than the minimum quantity required by those laws those manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell the excess credits to other manufacturers who can then apply such credits to comply with the regulatory requirements including making up for deficits as a manufacturer solely of zeroemission vehicles we have no minimum requirement and therefore earn zev credits on each vehicle delivered and placed into service in such states we have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the zev credits that we earn recently california passed amendments to the zev mandate that would require starting in 2018 all largevolume manufacturers those manufacturers selling 20000 or more vehicles in california in 2018 to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold such that 154 of each manufacturers’ fleet must be made of zero emission vehicles by 2025 all states that have adopted the california program will amend their programs to conform to the new california standards 

additionally under the environmental protection agency’s epa national greenhouse gas ghg emission standards and similar standards adopted by the canadian government car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average carbon dioxide emissions standards manufacturers who fail to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can use the credits to comply with these regulatory requirements as a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles we earn the full amount of ghg credits established by the standards on each vehicle sold we have contracted with another automobile manufacturer to sell all earned credits 

under the national highway traffic safety administration’s nhtsa corporate average fuel economy cafe standards car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average fuel economy standards manufacturers that fail to meet such standards have a deficit in their fuel economy profile manufacturers whose fleetwide average performs better than such standards may earn credits manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can use such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements we have entered into agreements to sell the credits that we earn 

regulation—vehicle safety and testing 

our vehicles are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by nhtsa including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss model s and model x fully comply with all fmvsss without the need for any exemptions

as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable fmvss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the united sta tes numerous fmvss apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements we are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by nhtsa including the cafe standards t heft prevention act requirements consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements 

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition the act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted

our vehicles sold in outside of the us are subject to foreign safety testing regulations many of those regulations are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the united states and may require redesign andor retesting 

regulation—battery safety and testing 

our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation the regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation such as by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations

we use lithium metal oxide cells in our high voltage battery packs the cells do not contain any lead mercury cadmium other hazardous materials heavy metals or toxic materials our battery packs include certain packaging materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs if a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation 

state laws regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state as we open additional tesla stores and service centers we secure dealer licenses or their equivalent and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers a few states such as texas and michigan do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet phone or mail in such states we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and are not retail locations 

as we expand our retail footprint in the united states some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations although we have thus far prevailed in every lawsuit brought by dealer associations we expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model in addition we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations 

while we have analyzed the principal laws in the us eu china japan uk and australia relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis of all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in certain jurisdictions that may restrict our sales and service operations 

competition 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future as we introduce additional lower priced vehicles such as our model 3 

we believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to

















we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology for example model s competes primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan market with internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers including audi bmw lexus and mercedes our vehicles also compete with vehicles propelled by alternative fuels principally electricity 

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle bmw daimler nissan fiat ford and mitsubishi among others have electric vehicles available today moreover porsche lexus audi volkswagen and volvo as well as a number of prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles 

the market for energy storage products is also highly competitive established companies as well as emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio for instance there are several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems such as cells battery modules and power electronics as well as others providing integrated systems 

most of our current and potential competitors in both the automotive and energy storage markets have significantly greater resources than we do may be able to devote greater resources to the manufacture sale and support of their products and have other advantages we believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles electric vehicle components and energy storage products as well as our history of vehicle development and production however are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition 

intellectual property 

as part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights in various ways including through trademarks copyrights trade secrets including knowhow patents patent applications employee and third party nondisclosure agreements intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights additionally consistent with our mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport we announced a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world 

segment information 

we operate as one reportable segment which is the design development manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

risks related to our business and industry 

we may experience significant delays or other complications in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of new vehicles such as model x and future vehicles such as model 3 which could harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

we may experience significant delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles such as model x while we commenced model x deliveries late in the third quarter of 2015 we have only recently begun manufacturing model x vehicles and various factors could result in delays in its production ramp including the capacity of our suppliers to deliver us components at the timing and volumes we require and production limitations that are needed to maintain our quality production standards in addition since model x shares certain production facilities with the model s the volume or efficiency of model s production may be impacted if the ramp of model x is not as efficient as we plan

we have experienced delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models in the past such as production ramp delays for model s in 2012 and the allwheel drive dual motor model s and the launch of model x any significant additional delay or other complication in the ramp of model x or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future vehicles including complications associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain or regulatory approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

the complexity in our business continues to grow as we introduce new products and variants

we have limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing upgrading adapting and selling our electric vehicles as well as limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple vehicles such as model s model x and model 3 and the variants thereof in the past when we have added complexity to our production line we have occasionally experienced unexpected delays similar problems may occur in the future as we simultaneously produce model x and model s vehicles as well as future vehicles and tesla energy products 

we may be unable to meet our production and delivery plans for model s and model x both of which could harm our business and prospects

we have significantly increased vehicle production and deliveries and our plans call for significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries going forward our ability to further increase vehicle production including the ramp of model x production will depend upon a number of factors including our ability to use new manufacturing processes as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels our suppliers’ ability to deliver sufficient volumes of quality parts to us in a timely manner and carefully but efficiently making design and production changes to ensure consistently high quality certain suppliers have historically experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints while our plans call for us to significantly increase vehicle production and deliveries in a short amount of time we may be unable to do so any delays or disruption in our production of model s and model x in line with our plans could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

in addition we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques for our vehicles such as aluminum spot welding systems and highspeed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts our vehicles also have unique design features such as a 17 inch display screen retractable exterior door handles and allnew dual motor and autopilot hardware introduced in model s and falconwing doors and other unique features introduced in model x each of which poses different manufacturing challenges

concurrent with the significant increase in our planned vehicle production levels we will also need to continue to significantly increase deliveries of our vehicles we have limited experience in delivering a high volume of vehicles and we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans into both existing markets as well as new markets into which we expand if we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally this could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

finally detailed longterm testing of quality reliability and durability of our vehicles is ongoing and in the case of model x vehicles has only recently commenced and any negative results from such testing could cause production or delivery delays or cost increases

our longterm success will be dependent upon our ability to achieve market acceptance of our vehi cles including model s and model x and new vehicle models such as model 3 

there is no guarantee that model s model x or our future vehicles such as model 3 will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public especially in the longterm although we have successfully grown demand for model s to date and have seen strong initial demand for model x and we believe that we will be able to continue to grow demand for these vehicles there is no guarantee that future demand for model s or model x will meet our expectations 

additionally we have limited experience in introducing new vehicles although our reservation conversion rate for model x has been strong we have only recently commenced production and deliveries of model x to the extent that we are not able to build model x in accordance with consumer expectations customers may cancel their reservations and our future sales could be harmed 

while we believe that there will continue to be separate and strong demand for both model s and model x we have limited experience in selling multiple vehicle models at the same time although we believe that each of our vehicles and their variants meet a distinct segment of the automotive market if our vehicles end up competing with one another in the market then our ability to sell each vehicle model at planned quantities or prices may be impacted

beyond model x we have announced our intent to develop model 3 which we intend to offer at a lower price point and to produce at high volumes we have not yet finalized the design engineering or material and component sourcing plans for model 3 if we are not successful in bringing it to market at the expected price point and the expected volume our operating results may suffer additionally while we expect model 3 to be an extremely popular vehicle we do not know what longterm demand for model 3 will be and whether it will meet our expectations furthermore the market for vehicles in the price range we expect for model 3 is larger but more competitive than the markets for model s and model x

problems or delays in bringing the gigafactory online and operating it in line with our expectations could negatively affect the production and profitability of our products such as model 3 or tesla energy products

to lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume we intend to integrate the production of lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for our vehicles including model 3 and tesla energy products at our new gigafactory we have limited experience in building a factory and no direct experience in the production of lithiumion cells also the cost and complexity of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online for lithiumion cell and battery pack production than we anticipate if we are unable to build the gigafactory in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithiumion cells at reasonable prices our ability to supply battery packs to our vehicle and other products according to our schedule andor at a price that allows us to sell them profitably and in the quantities we estimate could be constrained any such problems or delays with the gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

if our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains fail to perform as expected our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed

if our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains were to contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair our ability to develop market and sell our vehicles could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and could conceivably contain defects and errors issues that have historically been experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery in the model s although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our vehicles as effectively and as rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not be up to the satisfaction of our customers while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the longterm performance of our battery packs powertrains vehicles and tesla energy products there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to consumers

any vehicle product defects or any other failure of our vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays product recalls product liability claims significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects our model x vehicles have not yet been evaluated by nhtsa for its 5star safety ratings and while based on our internal testing we expect to obtain comparable ratings to those achieved by model s there is no assurance this will occur

we are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to continue to deliver or their refusal to deliver necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

model s and model x contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers despite efforts to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible furthermore we do not maintain longterm agreements with a number of our suppliers

while we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships or engineer replacement components for our single sour ce components we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us in particular while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a re latively short time frame qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle’s design 

this limited supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our vehicles and powertrain components we may experience delays due to supply chain disruptions with respect to model s model x model 3 and any other future vehicle we may produce such as those we experienced in 2012 in connection with our slowerthananticipated model s ramp in addition our currently ongoing transition from low to high volume production tooling for model x may take longer than expected which may adversely impact our shortterm financial results

changes in business conditions labor issues wars governmental changes natural disasters such as the march 2011 earthquakes in japan and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis furthermore if we experience significantly increased demand or need to replace certain existing suppliers there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner or that we could engineer replacement components ourselves 

changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost we have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made and we may experience similar cost increases in the future additionally we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer 

finally in october 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with panasonic corporation in order to address our anticipated short to mediumterm lithiumion battery cell needs while we expect that this supply agreement as amended will provide us with sufficient cells for the next few years we may not be able to meet our longterm needs including for model 3 and other programs we may introduce without securing additional suppliers or other sources for cells we have signed an agreement with panasonic to be our partner in the gigafactory and be responsible for among other things manufacturing cells from there for use in our products if we encounter unexpected difficulties with our current suppliers including panasonic and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers we could experience production delays which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

our future growth is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles

our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular if the market for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new rapidly evolving and subject to numerous external factors such as 













if we fail to manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company especially internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our vehicles successfully

any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we continue to expand our operations significantly internationally particularly in asia our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully risks that we face in undertaking this global expansion include controlling expenses establishing sufficient sales service and supercharger facilities in a timely manner adapting our products to meet local requirements implementing the required infrastructure systems and processes and finding and hiring a significant number of additional personnel including manufacturing personnel design personnel engineers and service technicians 

if we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing costs of model s control manufacturing costs for model x or otherwise control the costs associated with operating our business our financial condition and operating results will suffer 

as we have gradually ramped production of model s manufacturing costs per vehicle have decreased while we expect ongoing cost reductions to be realized by both us and our suppliers there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals we incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel we may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of our model s model x and powertrain manufacturing facilities furthermore if we are unable to produce model x pursuant to our plan due to cost overruns or other unexpected costs we may not be able to meet our gross margin and other financial targets

furthermore many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control such as potential increases in the costs of our raw materials and components such as lithiumion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels if we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate our operating results business and prospects will be harmed 

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which would cause our stock price to decline 

we occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections regarding sales and production as well as anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes and average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions if our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly 

our vehicles make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns and future events may lead to additional concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications 

the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells 

while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or redesign efforts all of which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithiumion cells such as a vehicle or other fire even if such incident does not involve our vehicles could seriously harm our business

in addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our manufacturing facility any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall moreover any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched as we have increased model s deliveries in markets outside of the united states we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro norwegian kroner chinese yuan and canadian dollar the recent strengthening of the us dollar therefore has reduced and any further strengthening of the us dollar would tend to further reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars in addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer as a result our operating results could be adversely affected

our resale value guarantee and leasing programs expose us to the risk that the resale values of vehicles returned to us are lower than our estimates and may result in lower revenues gross margin profitab ility and liquidity 

we offer resale value guarantees to many of our customers under which such customers may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined resale values customers can lease our vehicles through both leasing partners and from us directly through our captive finance companies the resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs may be lower than our estimates which are based on a limited secondary market for our vehicles if the volume of vehicles returned to us is higher than our estimates andor we are not able to resell them timely or at all our liquidity could be negatively impacted in cases where customers retain their vehicles past the guarantee period our gross margin will be negatively impacted as all remaining revenues and costs related to the vehicle will be recognized at no gross profit 

we apply lease accounting on sales of vehicles with a resale value guarantee and on leases made directly by us under lease accounting we recognize the associated revenues and costs of the vehicle sale over time rather than fully upfront at vehicle delivery as a result these programs generate lower revenues in the period the car is delivered and higher gross margins during the period of the resale value guarantee as compared to purchases in which the resale value guarantee does not apply a higher than anticipated uptake under these programs could therefore have an adverse impact on our near term revenues and operating results moreover unlike the resale value guarantee program or programs with leasing partners which do not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery under a lease held directly by us we may receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease to the extent we expand our leasing program without securing external financing or business partners to support such expansion our cash flow and liquidity could also be negatively impacted 

if we fail to effectively manage the residual financing and credit risks related to our direct tesla leasing programs our business may suffer 

we offer financing arrangements through our local subsidiaries in the united states canada germany and the uk including leasing directly through certain of those subsidiaries the profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund and grow this program and manage customer credit risk if actual residual values of our vehicles are below our estimates we may suffer lower profitability or potentially have losses if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with either internal funds or external financing sources we may be unable to grow our sales additionally if we do not properly screen customers for their creditworthiness we may be exposed to excessive credit risks and associated losses furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties either of which may harm our business

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials in particular lithiumion cells could harm our business

we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials any such increase or supply interruption could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells these risks include









our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage products while we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs we have fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers in particular we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in battery packs for our production vehicles any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendors could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased raw material costs could result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure ag ainst such claims 

product liability claims could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected resulting in personal injury or death we also may face claims related to any misuse or failures of our new autopilot technology a successful product liability claim against us with respect to any aspect of our vehicles could require us to pay a substantial monetary award our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and would have material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results we selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims meaning that any product liability claims will have to be paid from company funds not by insurance 

the automotive market is highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in this industry we currently face competition from new and established us and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from companies with new technology 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market for example bmw daimler nissan and many other large companies have announced or are also reported to be developing electric vehicles in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are selling hybrid vehicles including plugin hybrid vehicles most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do and almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

demand in the automobile industry is volatile which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results 

volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition the markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods including recent softening of the premium sedan category as a low volume vehicle producer we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results these effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industry then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially

consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts and other parties in our liquidity and longterm business prospects maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors such as our limited operating history unfamiliarity with our products competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed

our vehicles have unique servicing requirements and we are using a different service model from the one typically used in the automobile industry if we are unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely affected 

servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills including high voltage training and servicing techniques if we are unable to satisfactorily service our vehicles our ability to generate customer loyalty grow our business and sell additional vehicles could be impaired

we service our vehicles through our companyowned tesla service cen ters certain of our stores and through our mobile service technicians known as the tesla rangers we will need to open new standalone service centers in locations around the world and hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these ser vice centers and act as tesla rangers in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered vehicles if we do not continue to adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction particularly as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases our business would be harmed 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles in addition we may not be able to open stores or service centers in certain states or superchargers in desired locations

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our vehicles this ongoing global expansion may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale and service of our vehicles in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delays in expanding our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we face risks associated with our international operations and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions and establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business

we currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions that are subject to the legal political regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions additionally as part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sales service and supercharger locations internationally we have limited experience however selling and servicing our products internationally as well as limited experience installing and operating superchargers internationally furthermore international expansion requires us to make significant expenditures including the establishment of local operating entities hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention these risks include conforming our vehicles to various international regulatory and safety requirements difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations challenges in attracting customers foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements our ability to enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences of foreign nations for domestically produced vehicles 

additionally as we have expanded into new international markets we historically faced challenges with ensuring that our charging equipment works successfully with the charging infrastructure in such markets including in norway and china if customers experience problems with the way our charging equipment works with the local charging infrastructure or we are unable to adapt our equipment to resolve such problems then the viability and acceptance of our vehicles in such markets could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to successfully address these risks our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed

the unavailability reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives in the us and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles could have some impact on demand for our vehicles

we currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the united states and abroad such incentives include among other things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes taxes on nonrecurring vehicle fees the 25 value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gaspowered vehicles notably the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of incentives that are provided to gaspowered vehicles through the oil and gas industries notwithstanding that the former promotes social good while the latter contributes to significant social harm nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example on january 1 2016 a previously available incentive in denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired and was replaced with a newly phasedin incentive that is less generous than the incentive that it replaced in certain circumstances there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles

our strategic relationships with third parties such as panasonic are subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects 

our strategic relationships with third parties such as panasonic which supplies us with battery cells for use in model s and model x and which is our strategic partner in the gigafactory pose various risks to us including potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing servicing and supporting our products potential loss of business and adverse publicity moreover factors that may not be within our partners’ control such as materials pricing may impact our ability to realize the goals of certain strategic relationships such as cost and gross margin targets in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements with them such as with respect to quality of production parts and timeliness of their deliveries and we may have disagreements or disputes with these third parties the occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results

if we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer and jb straubel our chief technical officer 

none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

key talent may leave tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive experience currently in california there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineers manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner and retain current employees additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities any difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones would have an adverse effect on our performance

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman of our board of directors and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and chairman of solarcity a solar provider 

we are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities

as an automobile manufacturer we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations at numerous levels including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials both in the united states and abroad the costs of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and of any changes to our operations mandated by new laws or amendments to existing laws may be significant we may also face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities which would hinder our operation of these facilities such costs and delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results furthermore any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties remediation costs third party damages or a suspension or cessation of our operations

our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities 

although none of our employees is currently represented by a labor union it is common for employees at automobile companies to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition

we are subject to substantial regulation which is evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comp ly with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results 

motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations also we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the import sale and service of automobiles internationally for example we are required to meet vehiclespecific safety standards that are often materially different from us requirements thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance this process necessitates that foreign regulatory official’s review and certify our vehicles prior to market entry in addition we must comply with regulations applicable to vehicles after they enter the market including foreign reporting requirements and recall management systems

additionally we recently released a vehicle software update that delivers a range of new autopilot features that relieve drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel as autopilot is a completely new feature that us and foreign regulators have limited experience with there is a risk that regulators could take actions impacting whether and how our customers are able to use our vehicles equipped for autopilot which could adversely affect our business

we are subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws

our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages and other costs although we take steps to protect the security of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand

we may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance 

any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we previously experienced product recalls in may 2009 october 2010 june 2013 and november 2015 none of which was related to our electric powertrain or that resulted in a vehicle crash or personal injury reported to us in april 2009 we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider in october 2010 we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in june 2013 we initiated a recall of slightly more than one thousand model s vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position failure of this component may have resulted in collapse of the rear seat back during a crash in november 2015 we initiated a recall after we discovered a single customerowned model s with a front seat belt that was not properly connected to the outboard lap pretensioner furthermore in january 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain universal mobile connector nema 1450 adapters which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves potentially overheating during charging in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our vehicles or our electric powertrain components that we provide to other oems including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery we provide a four year or 50000 mile new vehicle limited warranty for the purchasers of new model s and model x vehicles the new vehicle limited warranty for model s and model x also covers the drive unit for eight years and the battery for a period of eight years or 125000 miles or unlimited miles depending on the size of the vehicle’s battery although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered under the new vehicle limited warranty or any extended service plan

in addition customers h ave the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty for model s and model x to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50000 miles provided it is purchased within a s pecified period of time the new vehicle limited warranty and extended service plans for the model s and model x are subject to certain limitations exclusions or separate warranties including certain wear items such as tires brake pads paint and gener al appearance and battery performance and is intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems powertrain and brake system additionally i n 2013 as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the customer ownership experience we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the new vehicle limited warranty in effect should this ch ange in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims we may need to record additional warranty reserves which would negatively affect our profitability 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed to protect our systems against breaches and cyberattacks if these efforts are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results and reputation could be harmed 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems to assist us in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the us and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems the implementation maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes these risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations we also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against system security risks data breaches and cyberattacks

we cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded as planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results moreover our proprietary information could be compromised and our reputation may be adversely affected if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions

our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks

we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of god and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage while we currently maintain general liability automobile property workers’ compensation and directors’ and officers’ insurance policies as a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to fluctuations in our operating costs

we expect our periodtoperiod operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we among other things design develop and manufacture model 3 tesla energy products and other future products increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes including ramping up the production of model x develop the gigafactory open new tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities open new supercharger locations increase our sales and marketing activities and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results especially in the shortterm are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time

any u nauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business 

our vehicles contain complex information technology systems for example our vehicles are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of our vehicles we have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our vehicles and their systems however hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks vehicles and systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle we encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our vehicles via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerabilities accordingly we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful

any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings in addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles their systems or data are capable of being “hacked” could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

if we had a desire or need to raise additional funds and could not do so our operations and prospects could be negatively affected

we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will provide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans however if the costs for developing manufacturing and delivering our current or future vehicles exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new significant strategic investments such as the gigafactory we may need to raise additional funds we need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects including those for our planned model 3 vehicle establish sales and service centers build and deploy superchargers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles if we cannot raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially adversely affected

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

we sell our vehicles from our tesla stores as well as over the internet we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the united states as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this sales model including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state in certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses we have worked with state regulators to open galleries which are not full retail locations

the application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so

in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws for example vehicle dealer associations in new york ohio georgia and massachusetts have filed lawsuits to revoke dealer licenses issued to us these lawsuits have been dismissed and in one court decision the supreme court of massachusetts held that state franchise laws like the one in massachusetts do not restrict a manufacturer like tesla that does not use franchised dealers from selling its vehicles directly to consumers such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model a similar lawsuit has been filed in missouri possible additional challenges in other states if successful could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states in some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills and regulations that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model other states such as new jersey new york ohio and pennsylvania have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate

internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time 

we may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs 

companies organizations or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our vehicles or components which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time we may receive communications from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their rights and urge us to take licenses in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to do one or more of the following











in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention

our patent applications may not result in issued patents which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from interfering with our commercialization of our products 

the status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth and effectiveness of patented claims is uncertain we cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions nor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford sufficient protection against someone creating a knockoff of our products or as a defensive portfolio against a competitor who claims that we are infringing its patents in addition patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws rules and procedures that differ from those of the united states and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications will result in issued patents in those foreign jurisdictions or that such patents can be effectively enforced even if they relate to patents issued in the us in addition others may obtain patents that we need to take a license to or design around either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results

our trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to outstanding opposition proceedings

we have filed trade and service mark applications for our tesla marks in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our products and services certain of our applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants alleging prior applications for or use of similar marks or refusals issued by trademark offices citing prior applications or registrations for allegedly similar marks if we cannot resolve these oppositions and refusals and thereby secure registered rights in these countries the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these countries will be diluted in addition there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take actions to challenge our use of the tesla marks in these countries such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the tesla marks in these countries if we were prevented from using the tesla marks in any or all of these countries we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets

our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters

our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facilities are all located in northern california a region known for seismic activity if major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products we may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substanti al debt 

we have incurred 30 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes issued in registered public offerings under certain circumstances relating to the reported trading price of our common stock the holders of our convertible senior notes may convert their notes at their option upon which we would be obligated to deliver cash payments andor shares of our common stock to the converting holders currently holders of an aggregate 6600 million tranche of notes have the right to convert their notes moreover holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change with respect to us in addition we have a senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility the credit facility under which we had 135 million of borrowings as of december 31 2015

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal when due to make periodic interest payments or to make other payments pursuant to the terms of our indebtedness such as with respect to our convertible senior notes upon their conversion or upon demand following a fundamental change depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy these obligations or obligations under any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our existing or any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make required payments under our indebtedness may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness furthermore any repayment of any of our existing or future indebtedness prior to their scheduled maturity could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

the terms of our credit facility contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt in addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio 

as a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it 

we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed immediately above

we and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our credit facility incur additional debt secure existing or future debt recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing our convertible senior notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due 

the classification of our convertible senior notes may have a material effect on our reported financial results

as described in the risk factor “ servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt” our convertible senior notes have been historically and may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances even if holders do not elect to convert their notes the notes become convertible prior to their scheduled maturity dates we would be required to reclassify such notes and the related debt issuance costs as current liabilities and certain portions of our equity outside of equity to mezzanine equity which would have an adverse impact on our reported financial results for such quarter and could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile

the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 28665 per share and a low of 14105 per share over the last 52 weeks the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies for example a shareholder litigation like this was filed against us in 2013 while the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs’ complaint with prejudice this litigation if the trial court’s order is successfully appealed or others like it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

conversion of our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their notes or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock

the conversion of some or all of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the notes as described in the risk factor “ servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt” our convertible senior notes have been historically and may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes may affect the value of the notes and our common stock

in connection with each issuance of our convertible senior notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlay the applicable notes the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock subject to customary antidilution adjustments however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates

in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the applicable notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes this activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the prices of the notes or the shares of our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the hedge counterparties have engaged or will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice

mr musk borrowed funds from affiliates of certain underwriters in our public offerings andor private placements and has pledged shares of our common stock to secure these borrowings the forced sale of these shares pursuant to a margin call could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business

beginning in june 2011 banking institutions that are affiliated with certain underwriters of our completed public offerings of common stock and our convertible senior notes made extensions of credit to elon musk and the elon musk revocable trust dated july 22 2003 or the trust a portion of which mr musk used to purchase shares of common stock in our public offerings in may 2013 and august 2015 and private placements in june 2011 and june 2013 we are not a party to these loans which are full recourse against mr musk and the trust and are secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk and the trust and other shares of capital stock of unrelated entities owned by mr musk and the trust 

if the price of our common stock declines mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to provide additional collater al for the loans or to sell shares of tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans the loans between these banking institutions on the one hand and mr musk and the trust on the other hand proh ibit the nonpledged shares currently owned by mr musk and the trust from being pledged to secure any other loans these factors may limit mr musk’s ability to either pledge additional shares of tesla common stock or sell shares of tesla common stock as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged tesla common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common stock to decline further 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws the provisions of delaware law and the terms of our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover attempt

our certificate of incorporation bylaws delaware law and the terms of our convertible senior notes contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions















as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

in addition the terms of the convertible senior notes require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change a takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview and 2015 highlights 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and energy storage products we are currently producing and selling our model s sedan and our model x sport utility vehicle since the introduction of model s in june 2012 we have enhanced our vehicle offerings with allwheel drive capability autopilot options and free overtheair software updates we commenced customer deliveries of our model x in september 2015 and are currently ramping production we have delivered over 107000 vehicles through december 31 2015 we intend to unveil model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market in the first quarter of 2016 and expect to commence production and deliveries of this vehicle in late 2017

in addition to our automotive products we recently announced the next generation of our energy storage products the 7 kwh and 10 kwh powerwall for residential applications and the 100 kwh powerpack for commercial and industrial applications we began production and deliveries of these products which we will sell under the tesla energy brand in the third quarter of 2015 we transitioned the production of these products from the fremont factory to the gigafactory during q4 2015 

our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicles during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized total revenues of 405 billion an increase of 8477 million over total revenues of 320 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily driven by growth of model s deliveries worldwide gross margin for the year ended december 31 2015 was 228 a decrease from 276 for the year ended december 31 2014

we continue to increase our sales and service footprint worldwide and expand our supercharging and destination charging networks with the continued global expansion of our customer support and supercharger infrastructure selling general and administrative expenses were 9222 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 6037 million for the year ended december 30 2014

 

 

management opportunities challenges and risks 

vehicle orders production and deliveries 

we are currently producing and selling both the model s sedan and the model x sport utility vehicle we have broadened the appeal of model s by introducing new variants that improve range performance and value for those wanting a more affordable car we introduced model s 70 with a starting price of only 70000 before incentives and fuel savings our new 90kwh battery pack option enables almost 300 miles of range at 65 mph finally for our performance enthusiasts the new ludicrous mode option improves 0 to 60 mph acceleration to 28 seconds the introduction of model x now provides customers with a performance electric vehicle option in the sport utility segment for the first time similar to model s we expect to introduce new versions and functionality for the model x over time overall we expect that demand for our vehicles will continue to increase worldwide as more people drive and become aware of our vehicles as we grow our customer sales and service infrastructure and as we continue to develop our products 

we have been increasing our production activities and expect to continue to do so in august 2014 we began a significant production capacity increase at the tesla factory by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center these production capacity increases continued into 2015 with further investments including building a new paint shop a new body shop for model x and additional stamping capacity we expect our annual production will increase considerably each year for the next several years in addition scaling our deliveries means that we will have an increasing number of cars intransit therefore production will exceed deliveries 

during 2015 we achieved significant efficiencies in model s production and produced 14037 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2015 we began production of model x in the third quarter of 2015 we plan to deliver 80000 to 90000 new model s and model x vehicles in 2016

in addition to expanding our vehicle production we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles over the next several quarters we expect that this trend will contribute to improved au tomotive gross margin over time excluding the impact of foreign currency movements significant cost improvements for model s were achieved in 2014 and 2015 relating to material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and manufacturing efficiencies excluding the impact of newly introduced model s variants and model x however during our product introductions over the last few years we incurred ma nufacturing inefficiencies which negatively impacted our gross margin we expect that automotive gross margin should increase during 2016 due to cost reductions for model s and improving margin on model x as our manufacturing effici ency improves for that v ehicle supporting our plan to be profitable for the fourth quarter of 2016 i f we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives or ramp model x efficiently our ability to reach our g ross margin goals would be negatively affected in the shortterm 

to support our planned vehicle growth in 2016 we plan to continue expanding stores and service infrastructure worldwide provide more timely service in areas with a high concentration of tesla customers and continue expanding our supercharger and destination charger network since we now offer our vehicles in many countries throughout north america europe and asia our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence we expect our longterm sales outside of north america will be almost half of our worldwide automotive revenue as compared to markets in the united states we have relatively limited experience in international markets and thus we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans if we experience unexpected difficulties or delays in finding and opening desirable locations for stores and service centers we may not be able to meet our delivery plans

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses 

we expect to see a net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the fullyear 2016 we plan to fund about 15 billion in capital expenditures without accessing any outside capital other than our existing sources that support our leasing and finished goods inventory we plan to invest in equipment to support cell production at the gigafactory begin installation of model 3 vehicle production machinery open about 80 retail locations and service centers and energize about 300 new supercharger locations

our operating expenses are expected to grow by about 20 in 2016 as compared to 2015 driven primarily by the expansion of our retail and service centers as well as increases in general and administrative costs to support the growth of the business we expect sales general and administrative expenses to decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue 

as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the net book value of our supercharger network was 3392 million and 1078 million and as of december 31 2015 included 584 locations globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to be a minimal portion of total capital spending during 2016 during 2016 this investment will grow our supercharger network by about 50 we allocate supercharger related expenses to cost of automotive revenues and selling general and administrative expenses these costs were immaterial for all periods presented

customer financing options 

we offer loans and leases in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and as of december 31 2015 had approximately 18400 vehicles under this program we expanded this program to selected european and asian markets during the first half of 2015 resale value guarantees available for exercise within the next 12 months total 1368 million in value and relate to 3017 vehicles

vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes 

while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows alternatively in cases where customers retain their vehicles past the expiration of the guarantee period the remaining deferred revenues and costs will be recognized at no gross profit 

based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially 

we currently offer leases in the u s directly from our captive financing entity as well as through a leasing partner leasing through tesl a finance is now available in 39 states and the district of columbia we also offer financing arrangements through e ntities in canada germany and uk as of december 3 1  2015 we ha d leased approximately 3 660 vehicles throu gh our captive financing entities in the us and germany and approximately 673 0 vehicles through our leasing partner le asing through both our captive financing entities and our leasing partner exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our nearterm operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting in addition for leas es off ered directly from our captive financing entities but not for those offered through our bank partner we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expand ing our leasing offerings 

the gigafactory 

we are developing the gigafactory as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules and battery packs in one location we broke ground on the gigafactory in june 2014 and began assembling our tesla energy products in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2015 we currently expect to produce cells at this site beginning in 2016 for use initially in our tesla energy products and later for our vehicles over the next few years we will continue to invest in the expansion of additional tesla energy production capacity 

we continue to invest in construction of the building and utilities at the gigafactory and in production equipment for battery module and pack production we will be responsible for the overall management of the gigafactory and will engage with partners who have significant experience in battery cell and material production panasonic has agreed to partner with us on the gigafactory with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices as these terms convey a right to use the production related assets as defined within asc 840 – leases  we will consider these leased assets beginning with the start of cell production in 2016

given the size and complexity of this undertaking the cost of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectations we may have difficulty signing up additional partners and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue for products and services when i a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

vehicle sales include standard features customer selected options and accessories and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including free internet connectivity access to our supercharger network and future over the air software updates these deliverables are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year period if we sell a deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar options and other information which may be available

vehicle sales to customers with a residual value guarantee 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified banking partners under this program customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a predetermined resale value guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the residual value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the stated guarantee period the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles to leased vehicles on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive revenue over the same period

in cases when customer retains ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive revenue in cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer at an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to preowned vehicle inventory as of december 31 2015 1368 million of guarantees are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a residual value guarantee

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we also began offering residual value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners as we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to endcustomers we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under asc 840  leases  under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantee for the longterm portion and deferred revenue for the current portion we accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive revenue on a straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to leased vehicles on our consolidated balance sheets and record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the residual value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive revenue in cases where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive revenue the maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program assuming we repurchase of all vehicles under this program is 3482 million at december 31 2015

as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 we had 5275 million and 167 million of such borrowings recorded in the resale value guarantee liability and 1205 million and 39 million recorded in deferred revenue liability

at least annually we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be significant changes to their estimated values

we offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the united states canada and germany qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for 36 or 48 months at the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 we had deferred 258 million and 94 million of leaserelated upfront payments which will be recognized on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the individual leases lease revenues are recorded in automotive revenue and for the year ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 we recognized 412 million and 44 million

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations 

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicl e limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles production powertrain components and systems and tesla energy products we sell at the time of delivery we accrue for a manufacturer’s warranty which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserve in the future the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as a current liability 

our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements costs to repair these vehicles are expensed as incurred warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock options and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

in august 2012 our board of directors granted 527 4901 stock options to our ceo 2012 ceo grant the 2012 ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service t o us through each vesting date 

each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten predetermined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 40 billion as compared to the initial market capitalization of 32 billion measured at the time of the 2012 ceo grant





















the term of the 2012 ceo grant is ten years so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested options will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise 

we measured the fair value of the 2012 ceo grant using a monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions riskfree interest rate of 165 expected term of ten years expected volatility of 55 and dividend yield of 0

stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2012 ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met

as of december 31 2015 the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and the following performance milestones were achieved and approved by our board of directors and therefore four of ten tranches of the 2012 ceo grant were vested as of such date 









as of december 31 2015 the following two performance milestones were considered probable of achievement





as the above three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 106 million 250 million and 145 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

additionally no cash compensation has ever been received by our ceo for his services to the company

income taxes 

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the united states in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2015 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize th e effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those po sitions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such j urisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we s till have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made

summary of cash flows

 



 

cash flows from operating activities 

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as manufacturing research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory personnel related expenditures accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities 

our operating cash inflows include cash from sales of our vehicles customer deposits for model s and model x sales of regulatory credits cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems these cash inflows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating leases and interest expense on our financings 

cash provided by used in operating activities was 5245 million 573 million and 2648 in 2015 2014 and 2013 the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to an increase in overall inventory to support growth and increase in operating lease vehicles partially offset by proceeds from sales and higher operating expenses in rd and sga 

the decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to an increase in finished goods inventory primarily due to cars whose delivery slipped from q4 of 2014 to the following year an increase in raw material inventory balances at year end necessary to meet our planned production requirements for model s in q1 of the following year higher operating expenses in rd and sga and use of cash for vehicles directly leased by us partially offset by increased cash receipts from customer payments on vehicle sales including an increase in customer deposits

customer deposits 

we collect deposits from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and in some locations at certain additional milestones up to the point of delivery customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery customer deposits are fully refundable up to the point the vehicle is placed into the production cycle amounts are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer’s purchase balance at time of delivery as of december 31 2015 we held 2834 million in customer deposits

the increase in cash provided from financing in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to 21 billion net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 notes including the associated hedge and warrant transactions representing a 15 billion increase in debt financing as compared to 2013 cash flows from financing in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 included proceeds of 4150 million from the issuance of common stock in public and private offerings and 4523 million used to repay our doe loans

foreign currency risk 

we transact business globally in multiple currencies our international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and against the us dollar upon consolidation as foreign exchange rates vary revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany balances as of december 31 2015 our largest currency exposures are from the euro chinese yuan norwegian and danish krona canadian dollar swiss franc british pound and japanese yen we recorded foreign exchange losses of 456 million in other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2015 related the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 

we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies as of december 31 2015 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 1892 million recorded to other income expense net principally from intercompany and cash balances 

in november 2015 we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in japanese yen the derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes we document each hedge relationship a nd assess its initial effectiveness at the inception of the hedge contract and we measure its ongoing effectiveness on a quarterly basis using regression analysis during the term of an effective hedge contract we record gains and losses within accumulate d other comprehensive loss we reclassify these gains or losses to costs of automotive sales in the period the related finished goods inventory is sold or over the depreciation period for those sales accounted for as leases although our contracts are cons idered effective hedges we may experience small amounts of ineffectiveness due to timing differences between our actual inventory purchases and the settlement date of the related foreign currency forward contracts we have recorded zero amount of ineffect iveness within other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations as of december 31 2015 as o f december 31 2015 we had recorded a gain of 73 million to aoci related to our foreign currency cash flow hedges if t he us dollar ha d strengthened by 10 as of december 31 2015 the amount recorded in accumulated aoci related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax ef fect would have been a loss of approximately 211 million

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 120 billion as of december 31 2015 a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2015 we had 296 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding which are fixed rate instruments therefore our results of operations are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates however the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest based upon quoted market prices and level 2 inputs the fair value of our total debt was 34 billion as of december 31 2015

overview 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles advanced electric vehicle powertrain components and stationary energy storage systems we have established our own network of sales and service centers and supercharger stations globally to accelerate the widespread adoption of electric vehicles we believe our vehicles electric vehicle engineering expertise and business model differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers

we are currently producing and selling our second vehicle the model s sedan model s is a four door fivepassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling model s inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle the tesla roadster we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 and as of december 31 2014 we have delivered almost 57000 model s vehicles worldwide since its launch model s has won several awards including the prestigious motor trend car of the year for 2013 surveys by consumer reports gave model s the highest customer satisfaction score of any car in the world in 2013 and gave tesla service the best overall satisfaction rating in the entire automotive industry in 2015 model s also earned the highest safety rating in the united states by the national highway traffic safety administration we have continued to improve model s by introducing performance allwheel drive dual motor autopilot options and free overtheair software updates 

we anticipate commencing customer shipments of our third vehicle the model x crossover in the third quarter of 2015 this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as our allwheel drive dual motor system and fast 0 to 60 miles per hour acceleration after the model x our goal is to introduce the model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market in 2017

the commercial production of fully electric vehicles that meets consumers’ range and performance expectations requires substantial design engineering and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles our design and vehicle engineering capabilities combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system have enabled us to design and develop electric vehicles that we believe overcome the design styling and performance issues that have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles as a result we believe our customers enjoy several benefits including 







we sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network which we are continuing to grow globally we believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business we are also continuing to build our network of superchargers in the united states europe and asia to provide properly equipped model s vehicle owners as well as future tesla vehicle owners with fast and free charging to enable convenient long distance travel 

in addition to developing our own vehicles we have developed and currently sell and service full electric powertrain systems and components to other automobile manufacturers we also produce and sell stationary energy storage products for use in homes commercial sites and utilities the applications for these battery systems include backup power peak demand reduction demand response and wholesale electric market services

 

we manufacture our products primarily at our facilities in fremont california lathrop california and tilburg netherlands we are developing the tesla gigafactory a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material cell module and battery pack production at a site near reno nevada we plan to use the battery packs manufactured at the gigafactory for our vehicles starting initially for model s and model x in 2016 and later for our model 3 vehicle as well as for stationary storage applications 

our vehicles and products 

we currently design develop manufacture and sell fully electric vehicles and electric powertrain components we are currently selling primarily the model s 

model s 

model s is a fully electric fourdoor fiveadult passenger sedan that offers compelling range and performance with zero tailpipe emissions we began customer deliveries in june 2012 as of december 31 2014 we had delivered almost 57000 model s vehicles 

model s offers a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles as determined using the united states epa’s combined twocycle cityhighway test to complement this range we also offer the capability to fast charge model s at our supercharger facilities in addition we designed model s to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at certain of our service centers and specialized commercial battery exchange facilities that we anticipate may be available in the future 

the 60 kwh and 85 kwh battery pack versions of model s have an effective base price of 62400 and 72400 respectively in the united states assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles we offer performance and allwheel drive dual motor system options with our 85 kwh model s the performance version of our allwheel drive dual motor model s accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 32 seconds making it the quickest sedan in the world according to motor trend magazine

we believe model s offers a unique combination of functionality convenience safety and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency with the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle our single motor model s provides best in class storage space of 316 cubic feet including storage under both the tailgate and the hood by way of comparison this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2015 bmw 5 series sedan and the approximately 18 cubic feet of storage available in the 2015 cadillac xts in addition we have designed model s to include a third row with two rearfacing child seats allowing us to offer seating for five adults and two children model s is also available with premium luxury features including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface and our advanced autopilot system our autopilot system which is being progressively enabled over time through overtheair software updates includes both safety features such as collision warning systems and automatic braking and convenience features such as traffic aware cruise control model s also offers advanced wireless connectivity such as 3g connectivity and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle we believe the combination of performance safety styling convenience and energy efficiency of model s positions it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments 

we have designed model s to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class we consider the purchase price cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation we assume comparable residual values warranties insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a model s purchase in addition to the competitive pricing of model s relative to other premium vehicles we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs for example assuming an average of 15000 miles driven per year an average electricity cost of 121 cents per kilowatthour and an average gasoline price of 283 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and premium gasoline price in the united states respectively for december 2014 and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of model s we estimate that our model s could save approximately 1600 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan in international markets where gasoline prices can be 23 times those of the united states the savings are greater 

we have designed model s with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we intend to leverage to create future electric vehicle models including our model x in particular by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development in addition we believe our strategy of using currently available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options 

 

model x 

our model x crossover is the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform this unique vehicle has been designed to offer the space and functionality of a sport utility vehicle while having high performance features such as our fully electric allwheel drive dual motor system model x will seat seven adults and incorporate a unique falcon wing door system for superior access to the second and third seating rows we anticipate that the pricing of model x will be similar to a comparably equipped model s we currently intend to begin customer deliveries of model x in the third quarter of 2015 after its initial launch in the united states model x will be sold in all the markets where model s is available including in asia and europe 

model 3 

we have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle called model 3 to be produced at the tesla factory we intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our model s we expect that this vehicle will be introduced in 2017 

the tesla roadster 

our first vehicle the tesla roadster is the first highperformance electric sports car it can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little as 37 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour the tesla roadster also has a range of 245 miles on a single charge as determined using the united states epa’s combined twocycle cityhighway test we have sold approximately 2500 tesla roadsters to customers in over 30 countries predominately in north america and europe we concluded the production run of the tesla roadster in january 2012 

stationary energy storage applications 

using the energy management technologies and manufacturing processes developed for our vehicle powertrain systems we have developed stationary energy storage products for use in homes commercial sites and utilities the applications for these battery systems include backup power peak demand reduction demand response and wholesale electric market services we began selling our home systems in 2013 and our commercial and utility systems in 2014 we plan to ramp sales of these products in 2015 

powertrain development and sales 

in addition to our own vehicles we also design develop manufacture and sell advanced electric vehicle powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers we have provided development services and full powertrain systems and components to daimler for its smart fortwo aclass and bclass electric vehicles and to toyota for use in its rav4 ev we are continuing to supply production parts for the daimler b class electric vehicle

technology

we believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain engineering vehicle engineering and innovative manufacturing our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain and the ability to design a vehicle which capitalizes on the uniqueness of an electric powertrain our electric powertrain consists of the following battery pack power electronics motor gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system we designed each of these major elements for our tesla roadster and model s and plan to use much of this technology in model x model 3 our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design enabling future generations of electric vehicles and our stationary storage applications to incorporate a significant amount of this technology further our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain these features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers

battery pack

we design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety reliability and long life for example we have designed our model s battery packs to store 85 kilowatt hours of useful energy and offer a warranty of unlimited miles over eight years our proprietary technology includes cooling systems safety systems charge balancing systems battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability robotic manufacturing processes customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding reallife driving conditions we have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithiumion cells in the demanding automotive environment we believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatthour

 

we have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry form factor and vendor in so doing we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers and ourselves to continue to improve the cost per kilowatthour of our battery pack we maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithiumion cell vendors and chemistry types we intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity longevity power delivery and cost we believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles in addition we are designing the cell manufacturing equipment for the tesla gigafactory to enable flexibility in terms of battery chemistry and form factor we believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software electronics manufacturing equipment testing and vehicle packaging will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology

the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage time and charging patterns customers’ use of their tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery’s ability to hold a charge for example we currently expect that the tesla roadster battery pack will retain approximately 70 of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100000 miles or seven years which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range in comparison with the roadster battery pack preliminary internal testing and customer results of model s to date suggest that the retention rate of the model s battery pack is greater due to improvements at the battery cell and pack level in addition based on internal testing we estimate that the model s would have an approximate 510 reduction in range when operated continuously in 0°c temperatures

to date we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries form factors and designs based on this evaluation we are presently using lithiumion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs we intend to use the same battery cell form factor in model x and entered into a supply agreement with panasonic corporation panasonic for the use of panasonic’s battery cells in model s and model x we expect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the tesla roadster 

power electronics

the power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack the power electronics have two primary functions the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging

the first function is accomplished through the drive inverter which converts direct current dc from the battery pack into alternating current ac to drive our threephase induction motors the drive inverter also converts the ac generated by regenerative braking back into dc for electrical storage in the battery pack the drive inverter performs this function by using a highperformance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle in so doing the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle

the second function charging the battery pack is accomplished by the charger which converts alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery tesla vehicles can recharge on a variety of ac electrical sources from a common outlet to a high power circuit of up to 22kw which provides faster recharging vehicles in both the united states and europe come with the tesla mobile connector which enables charging from a variety of different outlets in other markets tesla offers a tesla wall connector that can be hardwired at a wide range of power levels to suit the electrical capabilities of the charging location

the most common home charging system uses a standard high power and mobile connector to charge overnight on the road customers can also charge using our supercharger network or at a variety of destinations that have deployed our charging equipment in addition model s vehicles can also charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world either natively or through a suite of adapters this flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home

 

vehicle control and infotainment software

the performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software there are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors the flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle for example software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the “creep” feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator similar algorithms control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions we develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally we are also developing expertise in vehicle autopilot systems including road tracking lane changing automated parking driver warning systems and automated braking functions 

vehicle design and engineering 

in addition to the design development and production of the powertrain we have created significant inhouse capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems we design and engineer bodies chassis interiors heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models 

several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle for example we redesigned the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine we have developed expertise in integrating these components with the highvoltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle 

additionally our team has expertise in lightweight materials a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range model s is built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle 

sales and marketing 

companyowned stores and galleries 

we market and sell cars directly to consumers through an international network of companyowned stores and galleries our tesla stores and galleries are highly visible premium outlets in major metropolitan markets some of which combine retail sales and service we have also found that opening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand as a result we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and personnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint we refer to these as “service plus” locations including all of our sales service plus and service facilities we operated 159 locations around the world as of december 31 2014 

we believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and service model our customers deal directly with our own teslaemployed sales and service staff creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers we believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing maintain and strengthen the tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback further we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer 

 

tesla supercharger network 

we are building a network of up to 120 kw fast charging equipment each called a tesla supercharger throughout north america europe and asia for fast charging of model s and future tesla vehicles our supercharger network is a strategic corporate initiative designed to remove a barrier to the broader adoption of electric vehicles caused by the perception of limited vehicle range and to provide free charging access to tesla’s existing customers the tesla supercharger is an industrial grade high speed charger designed to replenish 170 miles of range in the battery pack in as little as 30 minutes supercharger stations typically have between four to ten superchargers and are strategically placed primarily along welltravelled highways to allow model s owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient minimal stops we currently have 380 supercharger stations open in north america europe and asia access to the supercharger network is currently available free of charge to owners of model s vehicles with the 85 kwh battery pack options and when purchased as an upfront option for 60 kwh we are planning to methodically expand the supercharger network over the next few years in the united states europe and asia 

destination charging

we are working with a wide variety of locations including hotels and popular destinations to offer an additional charging option for our customers these destination charging partners deploy our wall connectors and provide charging free of charge to model s owners almost 1000 locations in asia and north america currently have 1800 tesla wall connectors installed we plan to expand the destination charging program into europe in q2 of this year

orders and reservations 

we typically carry a very limited inventory of our model s vehicles at our tesla stores the vast majority of our customers customize their vehicle by placing an order with us we require a 2500 payment to begin production for these which is collected once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and has entered into a purchase agreement in certain markets we require additional payments a few weeks prior to delivery we require all remaining payment of the purchase price of the vehicle upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer

for model x which is currently not in production we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least 5000 reservation payments and deposits are used by us to fund in part our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand 

marketing

our principal marketing goals are to 









historically we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles and we believe we will continue to do so to date media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs 

our marketing efforts include events where our vehicles are displayed and demonstrated these events range from widely attended public events such as the detroit los angeles and frankfurt auto shows to smaller events oriented towards sales such as private drive events 

service and warranty 

service 

we provide service for our electric vehicles at our companyowned service centers at our service plus locations or in certain areas for an additional charge through tesla ranger mobile technicians who provide services that do not require a vehicle lift we own and operate 95 service locations as of december 31 2014 we are continuing our plan to build a number of additional service centers in several markets worldwide 

model s is designed with the capability to wirelessly upload the data to us via an onboard gsm system allowing us to diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle when maintenance or service is required a customer can schedule service by contacting one of our tesla service centers our tesla rangers or mobile service team can also perform an array of services that do not require a vehicle lift from the convenience of a customer’s home or other remote location 

 

we believe that our companyowned service centers enable our technicians to work closely with our engineers and research and development teams in silicon valley to identify problems find solutions and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers 

new vehicle limited warranty maintenance and extended service plans 

for our model s customers we provide a four year or 50000 mile new vehicle limited warranty with every model s subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery during the third quarter of 2014 we extended the warranty on our model s drive unit to eight years from four the new vehicle limited warranty also covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125000 miles or unlimited miles depending on the size of the vehicle’s battery although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered

in addition to the new vehicle limited warranty we offer a comprehensive maintenance program for model s which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles and an extended service plan the maintenance plans cover annual inspections 24 hour roadside assistance and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery with either a fixed fee per visit for tesla ranger service or unlimited tesla ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price the extended service plan covers the repair or replacement of model s parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the new vehicle limited warranty 

for our roadster customers we provided a three year or 36000 mile new vehicle limited warranty with every tesla roadster which we extended to four years or 50000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 tesla roadster customers have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty to cover the repair or replacement of roadster parts for up to an additional three years or 36000 miles provided they are purchased within a specified period of time we have previously provided our tesla roadster customers with a battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles 

our new vehicle limited warranties and extended service plans are subject to certain limitations exclusions or separate warranties including certain wear items such as tires brake pads paint and general appearance and battery performance and are intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems battery powertrain and brake system in addition all plans must be purchased within a specified period of time after vehicle purchase 

financial services 

we offer loans and leases in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we also offer leases directly through our captive finance company in 37 states the district of columbia and in 4 provinces of canada certain of our loan programs provide customers with a resale value guarantee under which those customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a predetermined resale value  this structure allows the customer to enjoy the benefits of model s ownership without concern for its resale value we introduced this program in north america in 2013 and expanded it to selected european markets in 2014 in certain markets we also offer buy back guarantees to financial institutions which obligate us to repurchase and the institution to sell us the vehicles for a predetermined price we intend to broaden our financial services offerings during the next few years 

manufacturing 

we conduct our powertrain and vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at our facilities in fremont california lathrop california and tilburg netherlands we are also building a cell and battery manufacturing facility the tesla gigafactory outside of reno nevada 

the tesla factory in fremont ca and manufacturing in lathrop ca

we manufacture model s and certain components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards for model s at the tesla factory the tesla factory contains several manufacturing operations including stamping machining casting plastics body assembly paint operations final vehicle assembly and endofline testing in addition we manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors gearboxes and components both for our vehicles and for our original equipment manufacturer customers at the tesla factory several major component systems of our vehicles are purchased from suppliers however we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at the tesla factory we recently commenced production and machining of various aluminum components at our facility in lathrop california

we continue to increase our production capacity at the tesla factory with the goal of producing model s model x and model 3 at this location in 2015 we intend to create a new body shop line to prepare for the expanded production of both model s and model x we are also finishing the construction of a new high volume paint shop to be used for model s model x and model 3 

 

the netherlands

our european headquarters is located in amsterdam netherlands and houses our sales service and administrative functions we also have operations in tilburg netherlands for final assembly testing and quality control for vehicles ultimately delivered into the european union the tilburg facility also serves as a paneuropean parts warehouse remanufacturing site and customer service center 

the tesla gigafactory outside of reno nevada

we are developing the tesla gigafactory as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material cell module and battery pack production in one location we plan to use the battery packs manufactured at the gigafactory for our vehicles and for our stationary storage applications we broke ground on the gigafactory in june 2014 and currently expect to produce cells at this site beginning in 2016 for use initially in model s and model x the gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020 which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500000 vehicles annually as well as for the production of our stationary storage applications by the time the gigafactory reaches full annualized production in 2020 we expect battery pack production capacity to reach 50 gwh of this we expect to build 35 gwh of cell production capacity at the gigafactory and purchase 15 gwh of cells from other manufacturers potentially including panasonic 

we believe that the gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30 on a per kwh basis by the end of the first year of volume production of model 3 the total capital expenditures associated with the gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be 45 billion of which approximately 2 billion is expected to come from tesla panasonic has agreed to partner with us on the gigafactory with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells we have agreed to prepare and provide the land buildings and utilities invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management we expect to announce other partners as construction progresses

supply chain

model s uses over 3000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 350 suppliers the majority of whom are currently our single source suppliers for these components we have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts while we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source in addition while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have currently fully qualified only one cell we expect to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers in 2015 

we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel cobalt nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials we believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements there are always risks and uncertainties however with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities or reasonable prices to meet our needs 

quality control 

our quality control efforts are divided between product quality and supplier quality both of which are focused on designing and producing products and processes with high levels of reliability our product quality engineers work with our engineering team and our suppliers to help ensure that the product designs meet functional specifications and durability requirements our supplier quality engineers work with our suppliers to ensure that their processes and systems are capable of delivering the parts we need at the required quality level on time and on budget 

customers and selected relationships 

we currently sell our cars primarily to individual customers we have strategic or commercial relationships with panasonic daimler and toyota 

panasonic 

panasonic supplies us with battery cells for our battery packs and has partnered with us on the construction of the gigafactory in january 2010 we announced that we were collaborating with panasonic on the development of nextgeneration electric vehicle cells based on the 18650 form factor and nickelbased lithium ion chemistry in october 2011 we finalized a supply agreement for these battery cells in october 2013 we entered into an amendment to the supply agreement to among other things provide for the longterm preferential prices and a minimum of 18 billion lithiumion battery cells that we intend to purchase from panasonic from 2014 through 2017 in july 2014 panasonic agreed to partner with us on the gigafactory

 

daimler ag 

beginning in 2008 we commenced efforts on a powertrain development arrangement with daimler since that time we have developed and produced powertrain components for daimler for the smart fortwo electric drive program the aclass electric vehicle program and the bclass electric vehicle program we started to supply production parts for the bclass electric vehicle program in 2014 and expect to continue to supply parts under this program for the next few years 

toyota motor corporation 

in may 2010 we and toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles and for us to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for model s since that time we have developed and produced a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which was integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 we began delivery of these systems to toyota for installation into the toyota rav4 ev in the first half of 2012 during the third quarter of 2014 we completed the rav4 ev program 

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

full repayment of united states department of energy loans 

in may 2013 we paid 4518 million to settle all outstanding loan amounts due under a loan facility we had entered into with the federal financing bank ffb and the united states department of energy doe under the doe’s advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program as set forth in section 136 of the energy independence and security act of 2007 atvm program we refer to the loan facility with the doe as the doe loan facility 

under the doe loan facility the ffb had made available to us two multidraw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of 4650 million beginning on january 20 2010 as of august 31 2012 we had fully drawn down the aforementioned facilities on may 22 2013 we paid 4518 million to fully retire our obligations under the doe loan facility 

in connection with the closing of the doe loan facility we had also issued a warrant to the doe to purchase up to 9255035 shares of our series e convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of 251 per share upon the completion of our initial public offering on july 2 2010 this preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase up to 3090111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 754 per share as a result of our repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the doe loan facility and the termination of the doe loan facility in may 2013 the doe warrant expired additionally we amortized all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the doe loan facility 

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives 

in december 2009 we finalized an arrangement with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority caeatfa that resulted in an exemption from california state sales and use taxes for the purchase of 320 million of manufacturing equipment as the equipment purchased would otherwise have been subject to california state sales and use tax we believe this incentive resulted in tax savings by us of approximately 31 million over the period starting in december 2009 and ending in december 2013 the equipment purchases were used for three purposes i to establish our production facility for model s in california ii to upgrade our palo alto powertrain production facility and iii to expand our tesla roadster assembly operations at our menlo park facility we exhausted all funds from the december 2009 approved exemption from california state sales and use taxes for 320 million of manufacturing equipment in december 2013

in january 2012 we finalized an additional agreement with caeatfa for an exclusion from california state sales and use taxes for the purchase of up to 292 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales or use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately 24 million over the period starting in december 2011 and ending in december 2015 the equipment purchased under this exclusion may only be used for two purposes i to develop model x and its production capacity in california and ii to further upgrade our powertrain production facilities in california we have not yet exhausted the 292 million in funds approved by caeatfa in 2012 

in december 2013 we finalized a third agreement with caeatfa that will result in an exclusion from california state sales and use taxes for an additional 415 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales or use tax we believe this 2013 incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately 35 million over the period starting in december 2013 and ending in december 2016 the equipment purchased under this exclusion may only be used for three purposes i to expand model s manufacturing capacity in california ii to expand electric vehicle powertrain production in california and iii future model s electric vehicle development 

 

regulatory credits 

in connection with the production delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers 

under california’s zeroemission vehicle regulations and those of states that have adopted the california standards vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in those states during each model year are zeroemission vehicles and partial zeroemission vehicles currently the states of arizona california connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new jersey new mexico new york oregon rhode island and vermont have such laws in effect these laws provide that a manufacturer may earn credits referred to as zev credits if they produce more zeroemission vehicles than the minimum quantity required by those laws those manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell the excess credits to other manufacturers who can then apply such credits to comply with the regulatory requirements including making up for deficits as a manufacturer solely of zeroemission vehicles we have no minimum requirement and therefore earn zev credits on each vehicle delivered and placed into service in such states we have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the zev credits that we earn recently california passed amendments to the zev mandate that would require starting in 2018 all largevolume manufacturers those manufacturers selling 20000 or more vehicles in california in 2018 to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold such that 154 of each manufacturers’ fleet must be made of zero emission vehicles by 2025 all states that have adopted the california program will amend their programs to conform to the new california standards 

additionally under the environmental protection agency’s epa national greenhouse gas ghg emission standards and similar standards adopted by the canadian government car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average carbon dioxide emissions standards manufacturers who fail to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can use the credits to comply with these regulatory requirements as a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles we earn the full amount of ghg credits established by the standards on each vehicle sold we have contracted with another automobile manufacturer to sell all earned credits 

under the national highway traffic safety administration’s nhtsa corporate average fuel economy cafe standards car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average fuel economy standards manufacturers that fail to meet such standards have a deficit in their fuel economy profile manufacturers whose fleetwide average performs better than such standards may earn credits manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can use such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements we have entered into agreements to sell the credits that we earn 

regulation—vehicle safety and testing 

our vehicles are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by nhtsa including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss the model s fully complies with all fmvsss without the need for any exemptions the roadster complies with or is exempt from all fmvss 

as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable fmvss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the united states numerous fmvss apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements we are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by nhtsa including the cafe standards theft prevention act requirements consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements 

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition the act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted

our vehicles sold in outside of the us are subject to foreign safety testing regulations many of those regulations are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the united states and may require redesign andor retesting 

regulation—epa emissions  certificate of conformity 

the clean air act requires that we obtain both an epaissued certificate of conformity and a california air resources board carbissued executive order with respect to emissions for our vehicles the certificate of conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the clean air act’s standards and both the certificate of conformity and the executive order are required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the epa to utilize california standards the california standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in california are set by carb states that have adopted the california standards as approved by epa also recognize the executive order for sales of vehicles 

 

regulation—battery safety and testing 

our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation the governing regulations issued by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa are based on the united nations un recommendations and model regulations on the transport of dangerous goods as well as related un manual tests and criteria the regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation such as by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the un manual of tests and criteria we also subject our battery packs to the appropriate tests specified in the society of automotive engineers sae j2464 and j2929 standards which incorporate tests such as immersion humidity and exposure to fire 

we use lithium metal oxide cells in our high voltage battery packs the cells do not contain any lead mercury cadmium other hazardous materials heavy metals or toxic materials our battery packs include certain packaging materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs if a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation 

state laws regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state as we open additional tesla stores and service centers we secure dealer licenses or their equivalent and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers a few states such as texas and michigan do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we must generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet phone or mail in such states we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and are not retail locations 

as we expand our retail footprint in the united states some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations although we have thus far prevailed in every lawsuit brought by dealer associations we expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model in addition we expect the dealer associations to actively lobbying state governors and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations 

while we have analyzed the principal laws in the us eu china japan uk and australia relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis of all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in certain jurisdictions that may restrict our sales and service operations 

competition 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future as we introduce additional lower priced vehicles such as our model 3 we believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for occupant safety and vehicle emissions technological advances in powertrain and consumer electronics components and shifting customer needs and expectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electricbased vehicles we believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to 

















we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology for example model s competes primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan market with internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers including audi bmw lexus and mercedes our vehicles also compete with vehicles propelled by alternative fuels principally electricity 

 

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market bmw daimler nissan fiat ford and mitsubishi among others have electric vehicles available today moreover porsche lexus audi volkswagen and volvo are also developing electric vehicles electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles 

most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do may be able to devote greater resources to the manufacture sale and support of their products and have other advantages we believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components as well as our history of vehicle development and production however are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition 

intellectual property 

as part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights in various ways including through trademarks copyrights trade secrets including knowhow patents patent applications employee and third party nondisclosure agreements intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights additionally consistent with our mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport we announced a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

 

risks related to our business and industry   

we may experience significant delays or other complications in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of model x as well as future vehicles such as model 3 which could harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we may experience significant delays or other complications in bringing new vehicles to market for example while we expect model x deliveries to start in the third quarter of 2015 refinements resulting from ongoing development and extensive testing of this vehicle could result in delays in its introduction complications could also arise from other factors including the expansion of our production capacity required to bring model x to market finalization of it supply chain and completion of regulatory approvals ahead of the model x launch we plan to expand capacity in several areas for our current and future vehicles including installing a state of the art highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum components for our vehicles increasing production on our new drive unit line installing a new robotic body assembly shop for model x production and commissioning a new paint facility our suppliers may not be able to provide components in a timely manner at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities finally we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that model x is in compliance with applicable nhtsa safety regulations and obtain epa and carb certification to emission regulations prior to beginning volume production and delivery of the vehicles 

we as well as other automobile manufacturers have experienced delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models in 2012 we experienced delays in the production ramp of model s and in 2014 we delayed the start of production ramp of allwheel drive dual motor model s any significant delay or other complication in the development manufacture launch and production ramp of model x or our future vehicles including complications associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain or regulatory approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our longterm success will be dependent upon our ability to design build and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models specifically model s and new vehicle models such as model x and model 3

our longterm success is dependent on market acceptance of the model s sedan and future electric vehicles we introduce in the united states there is no guarantee that model s will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public especially in the longterm as we expand in europe and asia there is no guarantee that customers in these markets will embrace our vehicles and if they do not demand for our vehicles could be lower than our expectations

moreover there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models including the model x crossover will become commercially viable to date we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of the model x work continues on the finalization of model x with beta model x vehicles undergoing extensive testing to the extent that we are not able to build model x in accordance with the expectations created by the early prototype and our announced specifications and schedule customers may cancel their reservations our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us

in addition we have also announced our intent to develop model 3 which we expect to produce at the tesla factory after the introduction of model x we intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our model s importantly we anticipate producing model 3 for the mass market and thus we will need a highvolume supply of lithiumion cells at reasonable prices

while we intend each of our production vehicles and their variants to meet a distinct segment of the automotive market our vehicles may end up competing with each other which may delay sales and associated revenue to future periods also if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of our vehicles this could result in inefficient expenditures and production delays furthermore historically automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently in order to meet these expectations we may be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models as automotive technologies change including those specific to electric vehicles we anticipate our customers will expect us to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology to date we have limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing upgrading adapting and selling our electric vehicles as well as limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple vehicles

 

we may be unable to increase production and deliveries of model s in line with our plans both of which could harm our business and prospects

since we began manufacturing and delivering model s in 2012 we have significantly increased production and deliveries and our plans call for an even greater increase in production and deliveries going forward as part of this effort we recently completed a new final assembly line and added more automation to our body shop at the fremont factory are installing a highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum components and are finishing the construction of a new high volume paint shop our ability to further rampup high volume model s production including for the allwheel drive dual motor model s which we recently began producing for the first time will depend upon a number of factors including our ability to use these new manufacturing processes as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels our suppliers’ ability to deliver quality parts to us in a timely manner and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high quality to produce a vehicle that meets our quality standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality to meet our demand certain suppliers have experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints any disruption in increasing our production level of model s in line with our plans could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results

in addition for model s we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques such as aluminum spot welding systems which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry and the model s has a number of new and unique design features such as a 17 inch display screen retractable exterior door handles and allnew dual motor and autopilot hardware each of which poses unique manufacturing challenges model s production and deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for model s or cause us to miss planned production targets any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results additionally sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that avoids significant cost overruns including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors may be difficult

concurrent with the significant increase in our planned production levels we will also need to continue to significantly increase our deliveries of model s vehicles we have limited experience in delivering a high volume of model s vehicles and in particular to locations outside of the united states we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in asia and the right hand drive markets we have entered which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals if we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally to match our production rate of model s this could result in negative publicity damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

our ability to grow volume production and deliveries for model s is subject to certain risks and uncertainties including





















finally detailed longterm testing of quality reliability and durability of model s is ongoing and any negative results from such testing could cause production or delivery delays cost increases or lower quality of our model s vehicles

 

problems or delays in bringing the gigafactory online and operating it in line with our expectations could negatively affect us

to lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in volume to allow us to grow quickly we intend to integrate the production of lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for our vehicles at our new gigafactory our gigafactory plan however is at an early stage while we recently entered into various formal agreements with panasonic on the gigafactory we have very little experience in building a factory of the size and scope planned for the gigafactory and no experience directly in the production of lithiumion cells in addition to date we have not finalized agreements with additional gigafactory partners that will be colocated at the gigafactory also the cost of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate if we are unable to build the gigafactory in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithiumion cells at reasonable prices then our ability to supply battery packs to our vehicles including model 3 according to our schedule andor at a price that allows us to sell them profitably and in the quantities we estimate could be constrained any such problems or delays with gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

if our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains fail to perform as expected or if we suffer product recalls our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed

our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains such as the toyota rav4 ev or the mercedesbenz bclass ev may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair for example our vehicles are highly dependent on software to operate software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced and changes to software may have unexpected effects model s issues experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery although we attempt to remedy the model s issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner such efforts may not be timely or up to the satisfaction of our customers

while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the longterm performance of our battery packs powertrains and vehicles specifically we have only a limited amount of data by which to evaluate model s upon which our business prospects depend due to the fact that we only recently began production in june 2012 there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers

we have experienced product recalls including in may 2009 october 2010 and june 2013 all of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain in may 2009 we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider which is the partially assembled tesla roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain in october 2010 we initiated a product recall for some of our tesla roadsters after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in june 2013 we initiated a recall of slightly more than a thousand model s vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position failure of this component may have resulted in the collapse of the rear seat back during a crash although the cost of this recall was not material and limited to a small number of total model s’s produced we may experience additional recalls in the future which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets as well as our business prospects and results of operations

in january 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain universal mobile connector nema 1450 adapters which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves potentially overheating during charging we further announced that we would provide upgraded nema 1450 adapters to our customers as an additional safeguard if such measures do not adequately address the underlying concerns our business prospects and results of operations could be harmed

our electric vehicles may not perform consistent with customers’ expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available for example our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market additionally while model s recently achieved an overall five star safety rating by nhtsa there is no guarantee that future model years or variants or other tesla vehicles will also attain such safety ratings and any such rating is not a guarantee of safe product design or that any individual vehicle will be free of any defect or failure

any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity lost revenue delivery delays product recalls product liability claims harm to our brand and reputation and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects

 

we are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to continue to deliver or their refusal to deliver necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

model s contains numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 direct suppliers the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components we expect that model x will be sourced in an approximately similar manner while we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturers the majority of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from single sources to date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not maintain longterm agreements with a number of our suppliers

while we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us in particular while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle’s design

this limited supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for our vehicles as well as for our powertrain component sales activities for example earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in japan in march 2011 or labor issues such as work stoppages or strikes at the ports on the west coast could negatively impact our supply chain we have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains including those relating to our slowerthananticipated ramp in our model s production goals for 2012 we may experience additional delays in the future with respect to model s model x and any other future vehicle we may produce 

in addition because we have written agreements in place with the majority but not all of our suppliers this may create uncertainty regarding a supplier’s obligations to us including but not limited to those regarding warranty and product liability changes in business conditions wars governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis furthermore if we experience significantly increased demand or need to replace certain existing suppliers there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us at all or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner in the past we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost and delay we have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made and we may experience similar cost increases in the future additionally we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer additionally cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal production processes thereby harming vehicle quality or reducing model s production output

furthermore a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our performance electric vehicles could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results

finally in october 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with panasonic corporation in order to address our anticipated short to mediumterm lithiumion battery cell needs while we expect that this supply agreement as amended will provide us with sufficient cells for the next few years we may not be able to meet our longterm needs including for model 3 and other programs we may introduce without securing additional suppliers or other sources for cells we have recently signed an agreement with panasonic to be our partner in the gigafactory and be responsible for among other things manufacturing cells from there for use in our products if we encounter unexpected difficulties with our current suppliers including panasonic and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers we could experience production delays which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

 

our future growth is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles

our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular if the market for electric vehicles in north america europe and asia does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new rapidly evolving characterized by rapidly changing technologies price competition additional competitors evolving government regulation and industry standards frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors

other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles and specifically electric vehicles include





































in addition reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles and based on our own internal testing we estimate that our vehicles may experience a material reduction in range when operated in extremely cold temperatures to the extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain widespread acceptance our ability to market and sell our vehicles particularly in colder climates may be adversely impacted

 

additionally we will become subject to regulations that require us to alter the design of our vehicles which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicles for example our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles due to concerns about quiet vehicles and vision impaired pedestrians in january 2011 congress passed and the president signed the pedestrian safety enhancement act of 2010 the new law requires nhtsa to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds nhtsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2013 and plans to finalize a rule as soon as sometime in 2015 with a potential effective date for implementation as early as 2018 this will begin a three year phasein schedule for establishing these minimum sounds in all electric and hybrid electric vehicles adding this artificial noise may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles which would materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and prospects

if we fail to manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company especially internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our vehicles successfully

any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we continue to expand our operations significantly in north america as well as in europe and asia our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully risks that we face in undertaking this global expansion include











we intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel including manufacturing personnel design personnel engineers and service technicians because our highperformance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines we may not be able to hire individuals with sufficient training in electric vehicles and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire competition for individuals with experience designing manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense and we may not be able to attract assimilate train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future the failure of which could seriously harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition

if we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing costs of model s control manufacturing costs for model x or otherwise control the costs associated with operating our business our financial condition and operating results will suffer

our production costs for model s were high initially due to startup costs at the tesla factory manufacturing inefficiencies including low absorption of fixed manufacturing costs higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain and higher initial prices for component parts during the initial period after the launch and ramp of model s as we have gradually ramped production of model s manufacturing costs per vehicle have decreased while we expect further cost reductions to be realized by both us and our suppliers during the next several quarters there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals

we incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our highperformance electric cars assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel we may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of model s and powertrain manufacturing facilities and the recent launch in asia furthermore if we are unable to produce model x pursuant to our plan due to cost overruns or other unexpected costs we may not be able to meet our gross margin targets

furthermore many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control for example the costs of our raw materials and components such as lithiumion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases indeed if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology shortages could occur which would result in increased material costs to us or potentially limit our ability to expand production additionally we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles including through the use of traditional media such as television radio and print even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited as we have to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts if we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate our operating results business and prospects will be harmed

 

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which would cause our stock price to decline

we occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections regarding the number of vehicles we hope to sell produce or deliver in future periods and anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows correctly identifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process our guidance is based in part on assumptions which include but are not limited to assumptions regarding







such guidance may not always be accurate or may vary from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors or because of the way that applicable accounting rules require us to treat new product and service offerings that we may offer we offer no assurance that such guidance will ultimately be accurate and investors should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution if we fail to meet our guidance or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance even if such failure or revision is seemingly insignificant investors and analysts may lose confidence in us and the market value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected

our vehicles make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns and future events may lead to additional concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications

the battery pack in our vehicles and the battery packs that we sell to toyota and daimler make use of lithiumion cells on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells extremely rare incidents of laptop computers cell phones and electric vehicle battery packs catching fire have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells

these events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications to address these questions and concerns a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithiumion battery cell chemistries to improve safety we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells however we have delivered only a limited number of our vehicles to customers and have limited field experience with them we have also only delivered a limited number of battery packs to toyota and daimler accordingly there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits we may have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains our battery packs and redesign our battery packs which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithiumion cells such as a vehicle or other fire even if such incident does not involve us could seriously harm our business

in addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our manufacturing facility any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall moreover any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to tesla’s vehicles may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

we have a history of losses and have to deliver significant cost reductions to achieve sustained longterm profitability and longterm commercial success

we have had net losses on a gaap basis in each quarter since our inception except for the first quarter of 2013 even if we are able to continue to increase model s production and sales and begin to produce and sell model x and future vehicles there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in order to achieve profitability as well as longterm commercial success we must continue to achieve our planned cost reductions control our operational costs while producing quality vehicles increase our production rate maintain strong demand in north america and grow demand abroad in europe and asia failure to do one or more of these things could prevent us from achieving sustained longterm profitability

 

foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar could harm our financial results

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched as we have increased model s deliveries in markets outside of the united states we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro norwegian kroner and chinese yuan the recent strengthening of the us dollar therefore has reduced and any further strengthening of the us dollar would tend to further reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars in addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer as a result our operating results could be adversely affected

the introduction of our resale value guarantee and leasing programs may result in lower revenues and profits and exposes us to resale risk to the extent many customers elect to return their vehicles to us and the residual values are lower than our estimates

in 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and canada and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners in april and october of 2014 we started offering leasing to business customers and individual customers respectively including through tesla finance our captive finance company both the resale value guarantee program and leasing offered through tesla finance generate lower revenues in the period the car is delivered as compared to cash purchases and both expose us to the risk that any vehicles repurchased or returned to us under the programs may be resold by us for prices less than we estimate

under the resale value guarantee program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a predetermined resale value as a result of this resale value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their vehicles to us we apply lease accounting to such purchases which defers the recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of full recognition at vehicle delivery although the resale value guarantee does not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery a significant uptake under this program could have a significant adverse impact on our near term gaap revenues and operating results

under the leasing program offered through tesla finance we lease vehicles directly to customers customers have the option of purchasing their vehicles at the stated value in the leasing contract or returning their vehicles to us we apply lease accounting to such purchases unlike the resale value guarantee program we may receive only a very small portion of the price of the vehicle from our customers at the time of purchase and instead will receive a stream of lease payments to the extent we expand this program and are unable to secure appropriate financing our cash flow and liquidity as well as our near term gaap revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted furthermore we are exposed to credit risk that customers may not pay their lease payments on time and according to the terms of our leasing contracts

under both programs we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles’ resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could impact our future cash flows andor profitability currently there is only a very limited secondary market for our electric vehicles on which to base our estimates and such a secondary market may not develop in the future our residual value and return volume estimates could prove to be incorrect either of which could harm our financial condition and operating results

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials in particular lithiumion cells could harm our business

we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials any such increase or supply interruption could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells these risks include









 

our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles’ battery packs as well as for the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers while we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendors could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices there can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by our customers result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and could materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results

our success could be harmed by negative publicity regarding our company or our products particularly model s

occasionally third parties evaluate or publish stories regarding our vehicles for example in 2013 the new york times published a negative review of the model s and our supercharger network on a route from washington dc to boston the story created a negative public perception about model s its capabilities and the supercharger network to the extent that negative comments about us or our products are believed by the public this may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles including model s and model x which can materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial conditions and prospects

our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers which makes evaluating our business operating results and future prospects difficult

our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today particularly in the united states we plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles in companyowned tesla stores and over the internet while we believe our approach is important to the success of our technology and vehicles this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven especially in the united states and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires in the aggregate a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system for example we do not utilize longestablished sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume which may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results moreover we compete with companies with wellestablished distribution channels

we have opened tesla stores in north america europe and the asia pacific region many of which have been open for only a short period of time we have relatively limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our tesla stores especially in asia our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges the concept and layout of our interactive stores which are typically located in high profile retail centers is different than what has previously been used in automotive sales we do not know whether our store strategy will continue to be successful we may incur additional costs in order to improve or change our retail strategy

other aspects of our distribution model also differ from those used by traditional automobile manufacturers for example we do not anticipate that we will ever carry a significant amount of vehicle inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they place an order until the time they receive their vehicle this type of custom manufacturing is unusual in the premium sedan market in the united states and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle if customers do not embrace this ordering and retail experience our business will be harmed

 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles a successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results we selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims meaning that any product liability claims will have to be paid from company funds not by insurance any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and financial condition we may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under such a policy

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems if these implementations are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems to assist us in the management of our business in particular our volume production of model s necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the us and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems these systems support our operations and enable us to produce model s and future vehicles like model x in volume the implementation maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes these risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations

we cannot be sure that these expanded systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented or sufficiently maintained if we do not successfully implement improve or maintain these systems our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results if these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions

we may not realize the benefits of our supercharger network which could harm our business brand and operating results

we continue to deploy tesla superchargers in the united states europe and asia tesla superchargers are a network of charging stations designed to provide fastcharge capability to owners of model s vehicles with the supercharging option we intend to expand the tesla supercharger network throughout the us canada europe and asia but we may be unable to do so due to a number of factors including the inability to secure or delays in securing suitable locations and permits problems negotiating leases with landowners or obtaining required permits for such locations difficulties in interfacing with the infrastructures of various utility companies and greater than expected costs and difficulties of installing maintaining and operating the network

we may also be unable to expand the supercharger network as fast as we intend or as the public expects or to place the charging stations in places our customers believe to be optimal furthermore even where superchargers exist the increasing number of model s vehicles as well as future vehicles such as model x may oversaturate the available charging bays at such superchargers leading to increased wait times and dissatisfaction for customers in addition as we have announced that we will not be charging our customers to access this network in addition to what they have already paid for their vehicles any significant unexpected costs that we encounter will entirely be borne by us and may harm our operating results although our supercharger network is intended to address customer concerns regarding longdistance travel this network may not result in increased reservations or sales of model s or future vehicles like model x if our supercharger network is not expanded as currently planned or as quickly as planned we may not realize the benefits of our supercharger network and our business and operating results could be materially affected

 

if we are unable to design develop market and sell new electric vehicles that address additional market opportunities our business prospects and operating results will suffer

we may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles address new market segments or develop a significantly broader customer base in 2012 we publicly revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform and are currently testing our beta model x vehicles we have also announced our intent to develop model 3 based on a smaller platform than the model s which we expect to produce at the tesla factory after the introduction of model x model 3 is currently planned to be a lower cost smaller sedan designed for the mass market therefore we intend to manufacture model 3 in significantly higher volumes than model s and there can be no assurance we can successfully scale our business accordingly in addition we have not yet finalized the design engineering or component sourcing plans for model 3 and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring this vehicle to market at the price point and in the volume that we currently intend if at all the market for vehicles in the price range we expect for model 3 is much more competitive than for model s and model x and therefore margins are likely to be lower compared to model s and model x margins our efforts to manufacture and sell a sufficiently profitable model 3 may not be as successful and therefore our business prospects and operating results may suffer our failure to address additional market opportunities would harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

the automotive market is highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in this industry we currently face competition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future other automobile manufacturers entered the electric vehicle market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter this market with respect to model s we face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market bmw daimler nissan fiat ford and mitsubishi among others have electric vehicles available today moreover porsche lexus audi volkswagen and volvo are also developing electric vehicles in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles for example in december 2010 general motors introduced the chevrolet volt which is a plugin hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack

moreover it has been reported that many of the other large oems such as daimler lexus and audi are also developing electric vehicles several new startups have also entered or announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles finally electric vehicles have already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well

most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do in addition almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design develop market and sell their products more effectively additionally we have not in the past and do not currently offer customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do

we expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry factors affecting competition include product quality and features innovation and development time pricing reliability safety fuel economy customer service and financing terms increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and prospects our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets if our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality price or performance of our cars or services we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

 

demand in the automobile industry is volatile which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results

volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition the markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general economic political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies as a low volume producer we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand as our business grows economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we currently or will sell our electric vehicles such as europe and asia will impact our business prospects and operating results as well demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives prices of raw materials and parts and components cost of fuel and governmental regulations including tariffs import regulation and other taxes volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results these effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industry then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially

our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support if we were to cease or cut back operations even years from now buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support as a result consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed if we are required to curtail our expansion plans in the future as we have done in the past this may result in negative perceptions regarding our longterm business prospects and may lead to cancellations of model s or model x orders and reservations

accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts and other parties in our liquidity and longterm business prospects in contrast to some more established automakers we believe that in our case the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following













many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed

we have limited experience servicing our vehicles especially in certain regions outside of the united states and we are using a different service model from the one typically used in the industry if we are unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely affected

if we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers and meet customer expectations regarding service our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected we have limited experience servicing our vehicles especially in europe and asia servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills including high voltage training and servicing techniques if we are unable to satisfactorily service our customers and the various service related issues that they are facing and may face in the future our ability to generate customer loyalty grow our business and sell additional vehicles could be impaired

 

we service our performance electric vehicles through our companyowned tesla service centers certain of our stores and through our mobile service technicians known as the tesla rangers however certain service centers have been open for short periods such as those outside of the united states and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these locations we will need to open new standalone service centers in locations around the world and hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these service centers and act as tesla rangers in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles we only implemented our tesla rangers program in october 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers’ vehicles there can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases

we do not expect to be able to open tesla service centers in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside in order to address the service needs of customers who are not in geographical proximity to our service centers we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile tesla rangers to service the vehicles at the customer’s location these special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers in addition a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network if we do not adequately address our customers’ service needs our brand and reputation will be adversely affected which in turn could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects

traditional automobile manufacturers in the united states do not provide maintenance and repair services directly consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers we do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles at this point we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future as our vehicles are placed in more locations we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales thereby harming our business and prospects

in addition the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain while we believe our tesla ranger program and our practice of transporting customers’ vehicles to our nearest tesla service center would satisfy regulators in these circumstances without seeking formal regulatory guidance there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states further certain state franchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service if issues arise in connection with these laws certain aspects of tesla’s service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law which may harm our business

we may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the tesla brand which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business revenues and prospects

our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand any failure to develop maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the model s model x model 3 and other future planned electric vehicles and sell our electric powertrain components if we do not continue to establish maintain and strengthen our brand we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and repair services and we have very limited experience in these areas any problems associated with the toyota rav4 ev and mercedesbenz bclass ev both of which use a tesla powertrain or the model x may hurt the tesla brand

in addition we expect that our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts to date we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand to further promote our brand we may be required to change our marketing practices which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses including the need to use traditional media such as television radio and print the automobile industry is intensely competitive and we may not be successful in building maintaining and strengthening our brand many of our current and potential competitors particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in detroit japan and the european union have greater name recognition broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do if we do not develop and maintain a strong brand our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted

 

if our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products the vehicle may not operate properly which could harm our business

automobile enthusiasts may seek to “hack” our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems also we are aware of customers who have customized their vehicles with aftermarket parts that may compromise driver safety for example some customers have installed seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised other customers have changed wheels and tires while others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle we have not tested nor do we endorse such changes or products in addition customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customers to injury from high voltage electricity such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles in addition we may not be able to open stores or service centers in certain states or superchargers in desired locations

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles this ongoing global expansion may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore there can be no assurances that we will be able to expand on the budget or timeline we have established we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale and service of our vehicles in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delays in expanding our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have opened tesla stores and service centers in major metropolitan areas throughout north america europe and asia and we plan to open additional stores and service centers worldwide to support our ongoing worldwide model s rollout we have also rapidly expanded our supercharger network in the us europe and china however we may not be able to expand at a sufficient rate and our planned expansion will require significant cash investment and management resources as well as efficiency in the execution of establishing these locations and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell and service our vehicles

furthermore certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that may preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sales in such jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects and operating results see risk factor “ we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles” additionally we may face potential difficulties in finding suitable supercharger sites in desired locations negotiating leases or obtaining required permits for such locations

we face risks associated with our international operations and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions and establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business

we face various risks associated with our international operations and expansion we currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions in europe and asia that are subject to the legal political regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions additionally as part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sales maintenance repair and supercharger services internationally particularly in china however we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles internationally as well as limited experience installing and operating superchargers internationally and international expansion requires us to make significant expenditures including the establishment of local operating entities hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention these risks include











 















additionally as we have expanded into new international markets we have faced challenges with ensuring that our charging equipment works successfully with the charging infrastructure in such markets for example we have encountered such challenges in norway and china if customers experience problems with the way our charging equipment works with the local charging infrastructure or we are unable to adapt our equipment to resolve such problems then the viability and acceptance of our vehicles in such markets could be materially and adversely affected

if we fail to successfully address these risks our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advanced diesel ethanol hydrogen fuel cells or compressed natural gas or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors

the unavailability reduction or elimination of or uncertainty regarding government and economic incentives in the us and abroad could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and prospects

any reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives due to policy changes the reduced need for such incentives as the customer base of our electric vehicles expands fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular such reduction or elimination of incentives could materially and adversely affect our growth as well because our business prospects financial condition and operating results as our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government incentives for example we currently benefit from certain exemptions in the united states such as the california state sales and use taxes similarly government programs in europe favor the purchase of electric vehicles including through disincentives that discourage the use of gaspowered vehicles in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes taxes on nonrecurring vehicle fees the 25 value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gaspowered vehicles if such government programs are reduced or eliminated or the available benefits thereunder are exhausted earlier than anticipated sales of all electric vehicles including our model s could be adversely affected in addition customers in certain markets may delay taking delivery of their tesla vehicles if they believe that certain electric vehicle incentives will be available at a later date which may negatively affect our ability to achieve our planned delivery targets

our strategic relationships with third parties such as panasonic are subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects

our strategic relationships third parties such as panasonic which supplies us with battery cells for use in model s and model x and is our partner in the gigafactory pose various risks to us including potential loss of access to important technology and vehicle parts potential loss of business and adverse publicity in addition these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements with them such as with respect to vehicle parts quality of timeliness and we may have disagreements or disputes with these third parties the occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results

 

the operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and our customers may experience difficulty operating them properly including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking

we have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain in certain instances these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles for example we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle however when the vehicle is at maximum charge the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed by the vehicle accordingly our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking in addition we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures in such instances the vehicle’s acceleration and speed will decrease finally if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains the vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected

there can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly especially in these situations any accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation result in adverse publicity and product liability claims and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition if consumers dislike these features they may choose not to buy additional cars from us which could also harm our business and prospects

if we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology we may suffer a decline in our competitive position

we may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and as a result may suffer a decline in our competitive position any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology as technologies change we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology in particular battery cell technology however our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles for example we do not currently manufacture battery cells which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs

if we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified management technical vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel our ability to compete could be harmed and our stock price may decline

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results as well as cause our stock price to decline in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of directors and jb straubel our chief technical officer none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team as well as technical vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive experience in addition we do not have “key person” life insurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees

currently in northern california there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineers manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner and retain current employees additionally we compete with many mature and prosperous companies in northern california that have far greater financial resources than we do and thus can offer current or perspective employees more lucrative incentive packages than we can any difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones would have an adverse effect on our performance

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman of our board of directors and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and chairman of solarcity a solar equipment installation company

 

we are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities

as an automobile manufacturer we are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials both in the united states and abroad environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by new or future amendments to such laws that may require us to change our operations potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business these laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs cleanup costs property damage bodily injury and associated fines and penalties capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations can be significant and violations of those laws may result in substantial fines and penalties third party damages suspension of production or a cessation of our operations these expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results

contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by us as well as at properties we will own and operate and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations including but not limited to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the government can impose liability on us under cercla for the full amount of remediationrelated costs of a contaminated site without regard to fault such costs can include those associated with the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil ground water and buildings as well as to reverse impacts to human health and damages to natural resources 

we may also face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and negatively impact our ability to operate these facilities which would adversely impact our business prospects and operating results as the owner of the tesla factory and surrounding land we may be responsible under federal and state laws and regulations for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the tesla factory whether it occurred before or after the date we purchased the property when tesla purchased the property the previous owner and operator of the tesla factory new united motor manufacturing inc nummi identified environmental conditions at the tesla factory that could adversely affect soil and groundwater and agreed to remediate these conditions although nummi stated that it fully documented and managed all environmental issues at the tesla factory we cannot determine with certainty the truth of this statement nor the total costs to remediate any preexisting contamination that may eventually be found we have reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions remediation activities and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing 

on either the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability including attorney fees or any costs or penalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental conditions and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement 

there are no assurances that nummi will perform its obligations under our agreement and nummi’s failure to perform would require us to undertake these obligations at a potentially significant cost such performance may also adversely affect the production capacity of and our ability to operate the tesla factory any remediation activities or other environmental conditions at the fremont site could harm our operations and the future use and value of the fremont site and could delay our production plans for model s

our business may be adversely affected by union activities

although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages our employees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory our automobile production facility in fremont california was purchased from nummi prior employees of nummi were union members and our future work force at this facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union we also own and operate another component manufacturing facility in lathrop california furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition the mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our reputation in the eyes of some investors and thereby negatively affect our stock price consequently the unionization of our labor force could negatively impact the company’s health

 

we are subject to substantial regulation which is evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results

the production and sale of motor vehicles in general and specifically related to electric vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in complying with these regulations

regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations in the united states the following are examples of regulatory and statutory issues facing us



















in addition as the automotive industry moves towards greater use of electronics in vehicle systems nhtsa and other regulatory bodies may regulate these electronic systems more stringently particularly as concerns about distracted driving increase such concerns could affect use of electronic systems in model s such as the 17 inch display screen which could reduce the appeal of model s or require adjustments to the display screen’s functionality

as we are currently delivering vehicles in europe and asia we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the import sale and service of automobiles in those regions for example we are required to meet vehiclespecific safety standards that are often materially different from us requirements thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance unlike in the us where we selfcertify our vehicles’ compliance with standards we must obtain advanced approval from regulatory agencies regarding the proper certification or homologation of our vehicles to enter into these markets this process necessitates that foreign regulatory officials review and certify our vehicles prior to market entry in addition we must comply with regulations applicable to vehicles after they enter the market including foreign reporting requirements and recall management systems

to the extent us or international laws change some or all of our vehicles may not comply with any new applicable international federal state or local laws which would have an adverse effect on our business compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome time consuming and expensive to the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected

 

we retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws

our collection use retention security and transfer of personal information of our customers is subject to federal state and international laws these laws continue to be enacted and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with changing international laws may cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to legal liability or require us to change our business practices our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages and other costs although we take steps to protect the security of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand

we may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance

any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we previously experienced product recalls in may 2009 october 2010 and june 2013 none of which was related to our electric powertrain in april 2009 we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider in october 2010 we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in june 2013 we initiated a recall of slightly more than one thousand model s vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position failure of this component may have resulted in collapse of the rear seat back during a crash finally in january 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain universal mobile connector nema 1450 adapters which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves potentially overheating during charging in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our vehicles including model s or our electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls voluntary or involuntary involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery we provide a four year or 50000 mile new vehicle limited warranty for the purchasers of model s the new vehicle limited warranty for model s also covers the drive unit for eight years and the battery for a period of eight years or 125000 miles or unlimited miles depending on the size of the vehicle’s battery although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered under the new vehicle limited warranty or any extended service plan

in addition customers have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty for model s to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50000 miles provided it is purchased within a specified period of time the new vehicle limited warranty and extended service plans for the tesla roadster and model s are subject to certain limitations exclusions or separate warranties including certain wear items such as tires brake pads paint and general appearance and battery performance and is intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems powertrain and brake system we have previously provided our tesla roadster customers with a battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles additionally in 2013 as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the customer ownership experience we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the new vehicle limited warranty in effect should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims we may need to record additional warranty reserves which would negatively affect our profitability

 

our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks

we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of god and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage while we currently maintain general liability automobile property workers’ compensation and directors’ and officers’ insurance policies as a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due fluctuations in our operating costs and the seasonality of our business

we expect our periodtoperiod operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we among other things design develop and manufacture model x and future products increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes develop the gigafactory open new tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities open new supercharger locations increase our sales and marketing activities and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results especially in the shortterm are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors if any of this occurs the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time

additionally sales of new cars in the automobile industry typically decline over the winter season and are generally higher during the spring and summer months we anticipate that our sales of model s and future models may have similar seasonality but our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue

unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles’ systems may cause them to operate improperly or not at all or compromise their safety and data security which could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business

there have been reports of vehicles of other automobile manufacturers being “hacked” to grant access and operation of the vehicles to unauthorized persons and wouldbe thieves our vehicles and in particular model s are technologically advanced machines requiring the interoperation of numerous complex and evolving hardware and software systems subject to our customers’ ability to opt out pursuant to our privacy policy model s is designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of these systems although we have designed implemented and tested security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our vehicles and their systems our information technology networks and communications with our vehicles may be vulnerable to interception manipulation damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors by personnel who have access to our networks and systems any such attacks or breaches could result in unexpected control of or changes to our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics hackers may also use similar means to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle such as its current geographical position previous and stored destination address history and web browser “favorites” any such unauthorized control of vehicles or access to or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and negative publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results

the range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time and this may negatively influence potential customers’ decisions whether to purchase our vehicles

the range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage time and charging patterns as well as other factors how a customer uses their tesla vehicle the frequency of recharging the battery pack at a low state of charge and the means of charging can result in additional deterioration of the battery pack’s ability to hold a charge over the long term for example we currently expect that our battery pack for the tesla roadster will retain approximately 70 of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100000 miles or seven years which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range and power preliminary internal testing and customer results of model s to date suggest that deterioration of the model s battery pack to be less than the roadster however such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and power over time as well as any perceived deterioration or fluctuation in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles

 

we may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected

the design manufacture sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will provide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans however until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows if the costs for developing and manufacturing model x exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new significant strategic investments such as the gigafactory we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions this capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects including those for our planned model x crossover and model 3 vehicle establish sales and service centers build and deploy superchargers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model x we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially adversely affected

if we fail to effectively manage the residual financing and credit risks for our recently launched model s leasing program our business may suffer

we recently introduced a leasing program in the united states and canada through our captive finance company tesla finance the profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund and grow this program and manage customer credit risk if actual residual values of model s vehicles are below our estimates we may suffer lower profitability or potentially have losses if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with either internal funds or external financing sources we may be unable to grow our sales additionally if we do not properly screen customers for ability to pay their leases on time we may be exposed to excessive credit risks and associated losses furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with federal and state financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties either of which may harm our business

any failure to execute on the daimler bclass ev program could hurt our reputation as well as our profitability on this program 

we have worked with daimler to develop a full electric powertrain for a daimler mercedesbenz bclass ev vehicle we have substantially completed our development services under this bclass program and commenced production of electric powertrains and battery packs for daimler the supply agreement for these products contemplates customary obligations of us such as timely deliveries warranty and product defect obligations if we fail to meet these obligations or if we exceed our current cost projections for producing these products our profitability on this program will suffer and this could have a negative impact on our operating results

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles

we sell our vehicles from our tesla stores as well as over the internet we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the united states as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state in certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses we have worked with state regulators to open galleries which are locations where potential customers can view our vehicles but are not full retail locations it is possible that a state regulator could later determine that the activities at our gallery constitute unlicensed sales of motor vehicles

in many states the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws and is being determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state how the sale transaction is structured the volume of sales into the state and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers as a result of the fact specific and largely untested nature of these issues and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators the manner in which the applicable authorities are applying their state laws to our distribution model continues to be difficult to predict laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so

 

in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws for example vehicle dealer associations in new york ohio and massachusetts have filed lawsuits to revoke dealer licenses issued to us these lawsuits have been dismissed and in one recent court decision the supreme court of massachusetts held that state franchise laws like the one in massachusetts do not restrict a manufacturer like tesla that does not use franchised dealers from selling its vehicles directly to consumers such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model similar lawsuits have been filed in georgia and missouri possible additional challenges in other states if successful could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states in some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills and regulations that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model such events recently occurred in new jersey where the motor vehicle commission at the behest of the local automobile dealer lobby passed a new regulation which purported to invalidate our sales licenses in the state and in michigan where the state’s automobile dealer association managed to add language into an unrelated bill that had the effect of impairing our right to sell vehicles through tesla stores in michigan we have brought a lawsuit in new jersey to invalidate that regulation which we believe to be unlawful and we are evaluating legislative and litigation solutions to remedy the situation in michigan other states such as new york ohio and pennsylvania have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate

we are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in canada australia and japan and have obtained licenses to sell vehicles in other places such as hong kong and china furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time

we may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs

companies organizations or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our vehicles or components which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time we may receive communications from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their rights and urge us to take licenses in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to do one or more of the following











in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention

we may also face claims that our use of technology licensed or otherwise obtained from a third party infringes the rights of others in such cases we may seek indemnification from our licensorssuppliers under our contracts with them however indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses depending on our use of the technology whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation and other factors

 

our patent applications may not result in issued patents which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from interfering with our commercialization of our products

the status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth and effectiveness of patented claims is uncertain we cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions nor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford sufficient protection against someone creating a knockoff of our products or as a defense against a competitor who claims that we are infringing its patents in addition patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws rules and procedures that differ from those of the united states and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued us patents will result in issued patents in those foreign jurisdictions in addition others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results

our trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to outstanding opposition proceedings

we currently sell and market our products and services in various countries under our tesla marks we have filed trademark applications for our tesla marks and opposition proceedings to trademark applications of third parties in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our products and services certain of our trademark applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants alleging prior applications for or use of similar marks if we cannot resolve these oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in these countries our ability to challenge third party users of the tesla marks will be reduced and the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these countries will be diluted in addition there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take actions to challenge our use of the tesla marks in these countries such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the tesla marks in these countries if we were prevented from using the tesla marks in any or all of these countries we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets

our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events

our corporate headquarters in palo alto tesla factory in fremont and additional component manufacturing facilities in lathrop are located in northern california a region known for seismic activity if major disasters such as earthquakes fires floods hurricanes wars terrorist attacks computer viruses pandemics or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products in addition our lease for our palo alto facility permits the landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain thresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts we may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition

if our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity

our core values which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity are an important component of our brand image which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices we do not control our independent suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices such as environmental responsibility fair wage practices appropriate sourcing of raw materials and compliance with child labor laws among others a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations

violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand this could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if as a result of such violation we were to attract negative publicity if we or other manufacturers in our industry encounter similar problems in the future it could harm our brand image business prospects financial condition and operating results

 

servicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt

we incurred 6600 million 9200 million and 138 billion respectively in aggregate principal amount of senior indebtedness when we issued pursuant to registered public offerings 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 2018 notes in 2013 and 025 convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 125 convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes in 2014 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal when due to make quarterly interest payments or to make payments upon conversion or to refinance the notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance the notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on the notes or future indebtedness

pursuant to their terms holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the final threemonth period of the scheduled term of the respective notes only under certain circumstances for example holders may generally convert their notes at their option during a quarter and only during such quarter commencing with the fourth quarter of 2013 in the case of the 2018 notes and the third quarter of 2014 in the case of the 2019 notes and the 2021 notes if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price for such series of notes on each applicable trading day as a result of this conversion feature the 2018 notes have been convertible at their holders’ option during each quarter commencing with the fourth quarter of 2013 except the first quarter of 2014 neither this nor any other conversion feature has been met with respect to the 2019 notes and 2021 notes and consequently the 2019 notes and 2021 have not been convertible at their holders’ option upon conversion of the notes we will be obligated to make cash payments in respect of the principal amounts thereof and we may also have to deliver cash and if applicable shares of our common stock in respect of such notes any conversion of the notes prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the notes or future indebtedness after any applicable notice or grace periods could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition holders of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted in addition our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to purchase notes at a time when the purchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof

we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above

we and our subsidiaries are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes or the indenture from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due

the classification of our notes may have a material effect on our reported financial results

as described in the risk factor “ servicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt” notes have been historically and may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances   even if holders do not elect to convert their notes the notes become convertible prior to their scheduled maturity dates we would be required to reclassify such notes and the related debt issuance costs as current liabilities and certain portions of our equity outside of equity to mezzanine equity which would have an adverse impact on our reported financial results for such quarter and could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock

 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions

as of december 31 2014 our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 280 of our outstanding shares of common stock in particular elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owned approximately 267 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december 31 2014 as a result these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile

our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market in 2010 and therefore the trading history for our common stock has been limited in addition the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 29142 per share and a low of 17722 per share over the last 52 weeks

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance these fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock during the period following a securities offering in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies for example a shareholder litigation like this was filed against us in 2013 while the trial court recently dismissed the plaintiffs’ complaint with prejudice this litigation if the trial court’s order is successfully appealed or others like it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources

a substantial portion of our total outstanding shares are held by a small number of insiders and investors and may be sold in the near future the large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock stockholders owning a substantial portion of our total outstanding shares are entitled under contracts providing for registration rights to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the united states subject to the restrictions of rule 144 in addition we have registered shares previously issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and agreements a portion of which are related to outstanding option awards subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the united states in the open market sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate these sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult to sell shares of our common stock

conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their notes or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock

the conversion of some or all of the notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the notes as described in the risk factor “ servicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt” notes have been historically and may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of notes may affect the value of the notes and our common stock

in connection with each issuance of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlay the applicable notes the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock subject to customary antidilution adjustments however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates

in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the applicable notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes this activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the prices of the notes or the shares of our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the hedge counterparties have engaged or will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice

mr musk borrowed funds from affiliates of certain underwriters in our public offerings andor private placements and has pledged shares of our common stock to secure these borrowings the forced sale of these shares pursuant to a margin call could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business

beginning in june 2011 banking institutions that are affiliated with certain underwriters of our completed public offerings of common stock and notes made extensions of credit to elon musk and the elon musk revocable trust dated july 22 2003 or the trust a portion of which mr musk used to purchase shares of common stock in our public offering in may 2013 and private placements in june 2011 and june 2013 interest on such loans accrues at market rates and the banking institutions received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans

we are not a party to these loans which are full recourse against mr musk and the trust and are secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk and the trust and other shares of capital stock of unrelated entities owned by mr musk and the trust the terms of these loans were negotiated directly between mr musk and the applicable banking institutions

if the price of our common stock declines mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans the loans between these banking institutions on the one hand and mr musk and the trust on the other hand prohibit the nonpledged shares currently owned by mr musk and the trust from being pledged to secure any other loans these factors may limit mr musk’s ability to either pledge additional shares of tesla common stock or sell shares of tesla common stock as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged tesla common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common stock to decline further

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws the provisions of delaware law and the terms of our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt

our certificate of incorporation bylaws delaware law and the terms of our notes contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions











 





these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

in addition the terms of the convertible notes require us to repurchase the convertible notes in the event of a fundamental change a takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the convertible notes to require us to repurchase the convertible notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the convertible notes

the fundamental change repurchase feature of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company

the terms of the notes require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change a takeover of our company would trigger options by the respective holders of the applicable notes to require us to repurchase such notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the notes

if securities or industry analysts publishing research or reports about us our business or our market change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely or cease to publish research or reports about us our stock price and trading volume could decline

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us our business our market or our competitors if any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors our stock price would likely decline if any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview and 2014 highlights 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles advanced electric vehicle powertrain components and stationary energy storage applications we are currently producing and selling our second vehicle the model s sedan model s is a four door fivepassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling the model s inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle the tesla roadster we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 and have delivered 56768 vehicles through december 31 2014 we recently announced the availability of our allwheel drive dual motor model s and began delivery starting with a performanceoptimized version in december 2014 

we are continuing to develop our model x crossover vehicle and intend to commence customer deliveries in the third quarter of 2015 after the model x our goal is to introduce model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market in 2017 

our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicles during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized total revenues of 320 billion an increase of 119 billion over total revenues of 201 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily driven by growth of model s deliveries worldwide 

gross margin for the year ended december 31 2014 was 276 a significant increase from 227 for the year ended december 31 2013 higher vehicle production volume supply chain efficiencies and component cost reductions partially offset by onetime manufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and introduction of allwheel drive dual motor model s contributed to higher gross margin in 2014 

research and development rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 were 4647 million an increase from 2320 million for the year ended december 31 2013 rd expenses in 2014 reflected our engineering work on model x as well as development work on our dual motor powertrain and other development programs including localization efforts for foreign markets rd expenses in 2013 reflected our activities on manufacturing process improvements model s cost reductions the righthand drive model s and localization efforts for foreign markets as well as development work on model x 

during 2014 we significantly increased our sales and service footprint worldwide entered several new markets including china as well as accelerated the rollout of our supercharging network with the continued global expansion of our customer support infrastructure and the business in general in 2014 selling general and administrative expenses were 6037 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2856 million for the year ended december 31 2013 

 

 

management opportunities challenges and risks 

 

orders production and deliveries

our orders for model s in 2014 significantly increased from the prior year as we expanded our operations internationally and introduced model s product enhancements in october 2014 we revealed our allwheel drive dual motor model s and our autopilot system this version of model s proved very popular leading to over 10000 unfulfilled orders as of january 1 2015 we expect that demand for model s will continue to increase worldwide as more people drive and become aware of our vehicles as we grow our customer support infrastructure and as we broaden the appeal of our products

as of december 31 2014 we had received almost 20000 reservations for model x in advance of its planned introduction later this year we are continuing to test the beta model x prototypes and plan to begin building and testing a small fleet of release candidate model x vehicles later in the first quarter of 2015 our ability to launch the model x program on time and cost efficiently is dependent upon a variety of factors including completion of production tooling supplier readiness engineering completion and the successful completion of our validation testing 

in order to meet this anticipated demand for both model s and model x we are executing a plan to increase our combined model s and model x production capacity to over 2000 units per week by the end of 2015 in august 2014 we began our production ramp by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center we are planning further investments in production capacity during 2015 including building a new paint shop and a new body shop for model x we expect our annual production will increase by over 50 each year for the next several years 

 

our recent production capacity expansion contributed to several weeks of production in excess of 1000 vehicles per week during the last few months of 2014 however the changeover to our new final assembly line during the third quarter of 2014 and the introduction of allwheel drive dual motor model s onto this line during the fourth quarter of 2014 took longer than we expected consequently we delivered fewer vehicles than we had planned in 2014 during 2015 we plan to achieve significant efficiencies in model s production and begin production of model x with the intent of achieving a significantly faster initial production ramp than we achieved with model s any unexpected issues with the expansion of our production capacity or the launch and ramp of model x production could affect our ability to meet future delivery targets 

in addition to expanding our production we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles and improve our gross margin significant cost improvements for model s were achieved in 2013 and 2014 including part cost reductions as well as manufacturing efficiencies we expect that this trend will continue as we execute on our roadmap we expect that such improvements when combined with a favorable mix of vehicles will allow us to achieve a 30 gross margin on model s by the end of 2015 assuming no further deterioration in foreign currencies however we expect these cost improvements will be partially offset by production inefficiencies during the introduction of model x during our product introductions in 2014 we incurred manufacturing inefficiencies which negatively impacted our gross margin when we introduce model x we expect that both production inefficiencies and supply chain inefficiencies typical of a new product introduction will suppress model x margins for at least a few quarters after its introduction if we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives or introduce model x efficiently our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected 

we expect to deliver approximately 55000 model s and x vehicles worldwide in 2015 approximately 74 more deliveries than we achieved in 2014 to support this growth we plan to continue to expand our supercharger stores and service infrastructure worldwide as well as to provide better service in areas with a high concentration of model s customers as we now offer model s in countries throughout north america europe and asia our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence based on our current projections we expect our longterm sales outside of north america will increase to almost half of our worldwide automotive sales despite initial challenges in china we plan to continue to invest in our infrastructure in china as we believe that the country could be one of our largest markets within a few years however as compared to markets in the united states and europe we have relatively limited experience in asian markets thus we may face continuing difficulties meeting our future expansion plans in asia 

trends in capital expenditures and operating expenses

our capital expenditures and operating expenses significantly increased in 2014 as we continue to invest in the long term growth of tesla capital spending and operating expenses will continue to increase but at a more moderate pace than in 2014 during 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be about 15 billion as we expand production capacity complete model x development and invest in the gigafactory our stores and service centers we also plan to grow our supercharger network by over 50 this year as well as continue other product development programs including model 3 

our operating expenses will continue to grow in 2015 but at less than half the pace of growth in 2014 or approximately 45 to 50 annualized our rd expenses in particular will continue to increase as we complete the development validation and testing of model x and accelerate design and engineering work on model 3 growth of sales general and administrative expenses will be more modest as we will be particularly focused on increasing operational efficiency while we continue to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we expect overall operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue

as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the net book value of our supercharger network was 1078 million and 256 million and currently includes 380 locations globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to be approximately 5 of total capital spending over the next 12 months we allocate supercharger related expenses to cost of revenues automotive sales and selling general and administrative expenses these costs were immaterial for all periods presented  

customer financing options

we offer loans and leases in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions in 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and have since provided this guarantee to approximately 10400 model s customers model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting although lease accounting will continue to impact our revenues and operating results as this and similar programs initially ramp up as time passes the amortization of existing deferred revenues and costs will begin to partially offset this adverse impact furthermore while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles’ resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our gross margin 

 

we currently offer leases in the us directly from tesla finance our captive financing entity as well as through a bank partner leasing through tesla finance is now available in 37 states the district of columbia and in 4 provinces of canada we leased approximately 1150 vehicles through tesla finance during 2014 and about approximately 200 vehicles through our banking partner leasing through both tesla finance and our banking partner exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our nearterm revenues and operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting in addition for leases offered directly from tesla finance but not for those offered through our bank partner we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we expect to increase our leasing activities during 2015

we have set the residual values given to our customers under our resale value guarantee program at what we estimate will be the tradein value of these vehicles at the end of the term of the option based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts should market values or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially 

 

the tesla gigafactory 

we are developing the tesla gigafactory a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material cell module and battery pack production in one location in june 2014 we broke ground on the gigafactory outside of reno nevada construction continued during the end of 2014 at an accelerated pace with first cells expected to be produced in 2016 for use in model s and model x 

while our plan is to produce lithiumion cells and finished battery packs at the gigafactory our plans for such production are at a very early stage we have no experience in the production of lithiumion cells and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production we recently formalized our agreement with panasonic to partner on the gigafactory panasonic will invest in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells we will prepare and provide the land buildings and utilities for the gigafactory invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management of the gigafactory we anticipate bringing on additional partners for the gigafactory to create a fully integrated industrial complex although planning discussions with production and supply chain partners continue to progress well to date we have not formalized any agreements with any other partners in addition the cost of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

automotive sales 

we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of model s including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits such as zev and greenhouse gas emission ghg credits we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems such as battery packs and drive units to other manufacturers revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

car sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including internet connectivity supercharging access and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware these deliverables are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the car or for software upgrades as they are delivered if we sell a derivable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options costs used to develop and deliver the service and other information which may be available 

 

resale value guarantee 

we offer a resale value guarantee program to customers who purchase a model s and finance their vehicle through one of our commercial banking partners in the us canada and europe under this program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period from 36 to 39 months after delivery for a specified value determined at time of purchase because we offer a resale value guarantee we account for these transactions as operating leases accordingly we recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straightline basis over the guarantee period to automotive sales revenue similarly we capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales over the same period 

at the end of the guarantee period which is the earlier of 39 months or the payoff date of the initial loan the resale value guarantee and deferred revenue balances are settled to automotive sales revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive sales if our customer retains ownership of the car in cases where a customer returns the vehicle back to us between months 36 and 39 we issue a check to the customer in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive sales revenue

at least annually we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of model s there may be significant changes to their estimated values 

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for model s which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery with either a fixed fee per visit for tesla ranger service or unlimited tesla ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations 

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of model s parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time for customers that are not covered by our new vehicle limited warranties or our extended service plans we offer tesla ranger service at a higher cost payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods 

we provided tesla roadster customers with the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36000 miles we refer to this program as our extended service plan amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales over the extended warranty period 

additionally we have previously provided customers of our tesla roadsters with a onetime option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles we refer to this program as our battery replacement program amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the battery packs

we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 

once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change material changes to these reserves may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

 

warranties 

we provide a warranty on all vehicles production powertrain components and systems sales and we accrue warranty reserves upon delivery to customer warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations and we will adjust our estimates as needed these estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as current within accrued liabilities while the remaining amount is classified as longterm within other longterm liabilities during the third quarter of 2014 we extended the warranty on our model s drive unit to eight years from four and reassessed our overall powertrain and vehicle warranty reserves which resulted in an additional charge of approximately 140 million

our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our operating lease vehicles including those sold with resale value or similar guarantee terms in such cases actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded as a component of cost of revenues

valuation of stockbased awards 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock options and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

in august 2012 our board of directors granted 5274901 stock options to our ceo 2012 ceo grant the 2012 ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date 

each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten predetermined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 40 billion as compared to the initial market capitalization of 32 billion measured at the time of the 2012 ceo grant











 











the term of the 2012 ceo grant is ten years so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested options will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise 

we measured the fair value of the 2012 ceo grant using a monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions riskfree interest rate of 165 expected term of ten years expected volatility of 55 and dividend yield of 0

stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2012 ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met

as of december 31 2014 the market conditions for six vesting tranches and the following performance milestone were achieved and approved by our board of directors 



as of december 31 2014 the following performance milestone was achieved and subject to our board of directors’ approval at the upcoming board meeting



as of december 31 2014 the following three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement







as the above three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 250 million 145 million and 13 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

additionally no cash compensation has ever been received by our ceo for his services to the company

income taxes 

we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans as of december 31 2014 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

 

 

results of operations 

revenues 

automotive sales 

automotive sales which include vehicle options and related sales and powertrain component and related sales consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

 



 

vehicle options and related sales primarily represent revenues related to deliveries of model s including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers powertrain component and related sales represent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems such as battery packs and drive units to other manufacturers 

vehicle options and related sales during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 308 billion 195 billion and 354 million the significant increases in vehicle options and related sales was primarily driven by the ramp in model s deliveries including the commencement of deliveries to europe in august 2013 and china in april 2014 deliveries of model s vehicles were 31655 in 2014 22477 in 2013 and 2636 in 2012 following the commencement of our model s deliveries in june 2012 the increase also resulted from higher sales of regulatory credits yearoveryear during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 regulatory credit sales were 2163 million 1944 million and 405 million

in april 2013 we launched our resale value guarantee program during the year ending december 31 2014 we delivered 5224 cars and recognized 1282 million revenue under this program during 2013 we delivered 5179 under this program and recognized 291 million of revenue as of december 31 2014 we recorded 3735 million in deferred revenues and 4879 million in resale value guarantee related to model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee as of december 31 2013 we recorded 2309 million in deferred revenues and 2363 million in resale value guarantee related to model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee

powertrain component and related sales for the periods presented were related to powertrain component sales to daimler under the mercedesbenz bclass electric drive program which commenced in april 2014 and to toyota under the rav4 ev program powertrain component and related sales for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 1133 million 451 million and 314 million during the third quarter of 2014 we completed the rav4 ev program 

 

development services 

development services represent arrangements where we develop electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other automotive manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs drive units and chargers to meet customers’ specifications we provided development services to daimler and toyota to assist in the development of electric powertrains for the mercedes benz bclass ev and the toyota rav4 during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we recognized revenue under these arrangement in the amounts of 56 million 157 million 276 million we do not expect any significant development services in future periods

beginning in the first quarter of 2015 we will change the caption of this to be services and other revenue this will include other revenues related to powertrain component sales to daimler and other oems vehicle service and sales from used model s cars

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services 

cost of automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 231 billion 154 billion and 3717 million cost of automotive sales includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs royalty fees shipping and logistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales also includes adjustments to warranty expense charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand and charges related to write down of fixed assets no longer in use for the production of model s or our powertrain component sales the increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by the ramp in model s deliveries 

in the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we recognized 661 million and 194 million respectively in cost of automotive sales related to vehicle depreciation for cars accounted for as operating leases for cars accounted for as leases our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 warranty costs incurred for our lease vehicles were 70 million and 16 million 

gross profit for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 8817 million 4563 million and 301 million gross margin for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 276 227 and 73 the increase in gross profit from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies as well as component cost reductions and higher regulatory credit sales partially offset by onetime manufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and launch of allwheel drive dual motor model s the increase in gross profit from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to higher vehicle production volumes cost reduction efforts including process efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain design improvements as well as reduction of waste in the supply chain 

research and development expenses 

research and development rd expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense overhead costs related to the tesla factory prior to the start of production of model s are also included in rd expenses also included in rd expenses are development services costs that we incur if any prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 were 4647 million an increase from 2320 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the increase in rd expenses consisted primarily of an 853 million increase in employee compensation expenses a 607 million increase in expensed materials primarily to support our model x dual motor powertrain and righthand drive model s development a 509 million increase in costs related to model x dual motor powertrain and righthand drive model s engineering design and testing activities a 281 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to increased headcount and increasing values of awards granted a 41 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs and a 33 million increase in shipping charges for model x dual motor powertrain and righthand drive model s development

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2320 million a decrease from 2740 million for the year ended december 31 2012 rd expenses decreased due to significant development prototyping and testing expenses related to the model s launch in 2012 partially offset by an increase in similar costs in 2013 for model x and righthand drive model s and other programs the 420 million decrease in rd expenses during the year ended december 31 2013 consisted primarily of an 182 million decrease in expensed materials an 85 million decrease in employee compensation expenses a 78 million decrease in costs related to model s engineering design and testing activities a 66 million decrease in shipping charges for model s prototype materials and a 49 million decrease in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs the decrease was partially offset by a 50 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 

sga expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 were 6037 million an increase from 2856 million for the year ended december 31 2013 sga expenses increased primarily from higher headcount and costs to support an expanded retail service and supercharger footprint as well as the general growth of the business the 3181 million increase in our sga expenses consisted primarily of a 1411 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 1359 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence a 358 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to additional headcount and increasing value of awards granted and a 272 million increase in professional and outside services costs

other income expense net 

other income expense net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates prior to the expiration of the doe warrant in may 2013 the doe warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income expense net 

other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 18 million 226 million and 18 million the other income net of 226 million in 2013 was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability of 107 million during the year in march 2013 we entered into a fourth amendment to the doe loan facility which among other things accelerated the maturity date of our doe loans to december 15 2017 therefore the doe warrant was no longer expected to vest the other income net also includes the favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currencydenominated liabilities during the year ended december 31 2013 especially related to the japanese yen 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 94 million 26 million and 01 million the increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions following the commencement of european model s deliveries in august 2013 and model s deliveries in asia in april 2014 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2014 we had 191 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including 127 billion of money market funds amounts held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 315 million as of december 31 2014 and consisted primarily of chinese yuan japanese yen euro and norwegian krone

sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of model s as well as customer deposits for model s and model x sales of regulatory credits cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over the next 12 months based on our current plans these cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations research and development projects for our planned model x model 3 and certain other future products purchase tooling and manufacturing equipment required to introduce model x and to continue to ramp up production of model s construct our gigafactory and establish and expand our stores service centers and supercharger network we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of about 15 billion over the next 12 months

when market conditions are favorable we may evaluate alternatives to pursue liquidity options to fund capital intensive initiatives should prevailing economic financial business or other factors adversely affect our ability to meet our operating cash requirements we could be required to obtain funding though traditional or alternative sources of financing we cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

summary of cash flows

 



 

cash flows from operating activities 

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as manufacturing research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory personnel related expenditures accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities 

our operating cash inflows include cash from sales of our model s customer deposits for model s and model x sales of regulatory credits cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems these cash inflows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating leases and interest expense on our financings 

cash provided by used in operating activities was 573 million 2648 million and 2638 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 the decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to an increase in finished goods inventory primarily due to cars whose delivery slipped from q4 of 2014 to the following year an increase in raw material inventory balances at year end necessary to meet our planned production requirements for model s in q1 of the following year higher operating expenses in rd and sga and use of cash for vehicles directly leased by us partially offset by increased cash receipts from customer payments on vehicle sales including an increase in customer deposits

 

the increase in operating cash flows in 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to an increase in cash receipts from customer payments on vehicles deliveries including for cars sold under our resale value guarantee program increased regulatory credits sold and increased customer deposits from orders for model s and x this was partially offset by an increase in inventory balances at yearend necessary to meet our planned production requirements for model s in q1 of the following year 

customer deposits 

we collect deposits from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and in some locations at certain additional milestones up to the point of delivery customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery customer deposits related to model x still represent fully refundable reservations amounts are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer’s purchase balance at time of delivery as of december 31 2014 we held 2576 million in customer deposits 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations including investments in model s manufacturing equipment and tooling and our stores service centers and supercharger network infrastructure cash used in investing activities was 9904 million 2494 million and 2069 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 cash flows from investing activities and variability between each year related primarily to capital expenditures which were 9699 million 2642 million and 2392 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 expenditures in all years consisted primarily of purchases of capital equipment tooling and facilities to support our model s and model x manufacturing 

in 2014 we began construction of our gigafactory facility in nevada tesla’s contribution to total capital expenditures are expected to be about 20 billion over the next 5 years in 2014 we used cash of 622 million towards the construction of the first stage of this project and expect to spend up to 300 million over the next 12 months 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 214 billion 6354 million and 4196 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in cash provided from financing in 2014 and compared to 2013 was primarily due to 21 billion net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 notes including the associated hedge and warrant transactions representing a 15 billion increase in debt financing as compared to 2013 cash flows from financing in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 included proceeds of 4150 million from the issuance of common stock in public and private offerings and 4523 million used to repay our doe loans

the increase in cash provided from financing in 2013 and compared to 2012 was primarily due to 5859 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2018 notes including the associated hedge and warrant transactions and a 1935 million increase in proceeds from public and private equity issuances in 2013 we used 4523 million to repay our doa loans as compared to proceeds of 1888 million received during 2012 under these loans 

025 and 125 convertible senior notes and bond hedge and warrant transactions 

in 2014 we issued 9200 million principal amount of 025 convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 138 billion principal amount of 125 convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes in a public offering the total net proceeds from these offerings after deducting transaction costs were approximately 9058 million from 2019 notes and 136 billion from 2021 notes respectively the interest rates are fixed at 025 and 125 per annum for the 2019 and 2021 notes respectively and are payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year commencing on september 1 2014 

in connection with the offering of these notes in 2014 we purchased a convertible note hedges for 6034 million and sold warrants 3892 million taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2019 notes and 2021 notes 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130 of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 notes and 2021 notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter furthermore no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of december 31 2014 therefore the 2019 notes and 2021 notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2015 and are classified as longterm debt should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2015 or a future quarter the notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter 

150 convertible senior notes and bond hedge and warrant transactions 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 the notes in a public offering the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million the interest under the notes is fixed at 150 per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 

in connection with the offering of the 2018 notes we purchased a convertible note hedge for 1775 million and sold warrants for 1203 million taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 notes

 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130 of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter therefore holders of 2018 notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2015 upon conversion of 2018 notes we will be obligated to pay cash for the principal amount of the converted notes and we may also have to deliver shares of our common stock in respect of such converted notes any conversion of the notes prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the notes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows business results of operations and financial condition should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2015 or a future quarter 2018 notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter under current market conditions we do not expect the 2018 notes will be converted in the short term 

for more information on the 2018 notes 2019 notes and 2021 notes see item 8 of part ii financial statements and supplementary data note 6  convertible notes and longterm debt obligation to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

contractual obligations 

we are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties including certain debt financing arrangements and leases primarily for stores service centers certain manufacturing and corporate offices these also include as part of our normal business practices contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts we have the following contractual obligations including firm purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the table below were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part at our discretion and are therefore not considered firm purchase obligations

the following table sets forth as of december 31 2014 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands 

 



 







 

in connection with our tesla factory located in fremont california we are obligated to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions existing at the time we purchased the property from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we accrued a total of 40 million and 55 million respectively related to these environmental liabilities nummi is responsible for remediation costs between 15 million and 30 million for up to 10 years from the closing date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

foreign currency risk 

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 to customers in north america and to european customers in august 2013 we recently introduced model s to china hong kong japan and australia through december 31 2014 a majority of our revenues have been denominated in us dollars however we have materially greater revenues than expenses denominated in the chinese yuan and norwegian krona and materially greater expenses than revenues denominated in the japanese yen december 31 2014 accordingly if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against currencies where we have a net short exposure our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase which may adversely impact our operating results conversely as the value of the us dollar appreciates significantly against currencies where revenues exceed expenses our revenues as measured in us dollars may be reduced 

as a result of a favorable foreign currency exchange impact from foreign currencydenominated liabilities especially related to the japanese yen we recorded gains of 20 million on foreign exchange transactions in other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2014 

interest rate risk 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 191 billion as of december 31 2014 a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2014 we had 296 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding and capital lease obligations of 218 million all of which are fixed rate instruments therefore our results of operations are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we have established our own network of sales and service centers and supercharger stations globally thus creating a unique business model in the automobile industry we have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies we believe our vehicles electric vehicle engineering expertise and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers 

we are currently producing and selling our second vehicle the model s sedan model s is a four door fivepassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling the model s inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle the tesla roadster which was launched in 2008 and was the first commercially produced and federally compliant ev in the united states we completed production of approximately 2500 tesla roadsters in january 2012 and began deliveries of model s in june 2012 as of december 31 2013 we have delivered over 25000 model s vehicles in north america and europe in 2014 we expect to grow our presence in several international markets with deliveries to commence in china japan the united kingdom and australia since its launch model s has won several awards including the prestigious motor trend car of the year for 2013 in november 2013 model s received 99 out of 100 in an owner survey conducted by consumer reports  the highest customer satisfaction score of any car in the world our goal is to deliver the highest possible level of ownership satisfaction in every way 

we are adapting the platform architecture of model s to develop our model x crossover this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as a dual motor allwheel drive system we revealed a prototype of model x in february 2012 we currently expect to have production design model x prototypes on the road by end of year and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015 we have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle to which we refer as “gen iii” which we intend to offer at a lower price point and produce at higher volumes than our model s in approximately three years 

we are also building a network of superchargers in the united states and europe to enable free and convenient long distance driving superchargers allow model s owners to replenish 50 of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes supercharger stations are strategically placed along welltravelled highways to allow model s owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient minimal stops as of february 19 2014 we had 90 supercharger stations open in north america and europe we plan to continue to open supercharger stations in these regions as well as in asia during 2014 and expect to triple our supercharger stations during 2014 we expect that model x and our future cars will be able to use this network 

we sell and service our electric vehicles through our companyowned sales and service network in north america europe and asia our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while gathering rapid customer feedback and achieving operating efficiencies better control over the costs of inventory warranty service pricing and the development of the tesla brand our tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and as a result do not require corresponding large floor spaces we believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business we believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers 

in addition to developing our own vehicles we provide services for the development of full electric powertrain systems and components and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers we have provided development services and powertrain components to daimler ag daimler for its smart fortwo aclass and bclass electric vehicles we also have developed a full electric powertrain system for 

  

toyota motor corporation toyota for use in its rav4 ev and began shipping production components to toyota in 2012 we also plan to start selling stationary energy storage products for use in homes commercial sites and utilities the applications for these battery systems include backup power peak demand reduction demand response and wholesale electric market services 

we conduct our powertrain and vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at the tesla factory our integrated manufacturing facility in fremont california and at our facility in tilburg netherlands we have recently indicated our intention to build the tesla gigafactory a facility in the united states where we intend to manufacture cells and battery packs for our vehicles and our stationary storage applications 

our fully electric vehicles combine zero tailpipe emissions market leading range on a single charge impressive acceleration and pricing competitive with other vehicles in their classes for example our model s accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little as 42 seconds and has a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles we offer model s with 60 kwh and 85 kwh battery pack options model s has an effective base price of 62400 and 72400 in the united states for the 60 kwh and 85 kwh options respectively assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles even without the tax credit we believe our list prices are competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles we believe that model s demonstrates our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer longrange capabilities and uncompromised performance energy efficiency convenience and design 

the commercial production of a highway capable fully electric vehicle that meets consumers’ range and performance expectations requires substantial design engineering and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles our roots in silicon valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering power electronics and software engineering we have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration we believe these capabilities coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong inhouse engineering and highly vertical manufacturing capacity will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the tesla roadster and model s 

our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver marketleading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatthour our battery packs use custom electric vehicle lithiumion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs motors powertrain systems and vehicle engineering our proprietary technology includes cooling systems safety systems charge balancing systems battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding reallife driving conditions these technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio—as of december 31 2013 we had 203 issued patents and more than 280 pending patent applications with the united states patent and trademark office and internationally in a broad range of areas including the battery pack and other technologies 

we are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles for example we have designed model s with a platform architecture which compactly positions the battery pack motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle we believe this architecture may form the basis of several future vehicles including our planned model x and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future 

our design and vehicle engineering capabilities combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe 

  

overcome the design styling and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles as a result we believe our customers enjoy several benefits including 

 

  

  

 our vehicles and products 

we currently design develop manufacture and sell fully electric vehicles and electric powertrain components we are currently selling primarily the model s 

model s 

model s is a fully electric fourdoor fiveadult passenger sedan that offers compelling range and performance with zero tailpipe emissions we began customer deliveries in june 2012 as of december 31 2013 we had delivered over 25000 model s vehicles 

model s offers a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles to complement this range we also offer the capability to fast charge model s at our supercharger facilities in addition we designed model s to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at certain of our service centers and specialized commercial battery exchange facilities that we anticipate may be available in the future 

we believe model s offers a unique combination of functionality convenience safety and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency with the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle model s provides best in class storage space of 316 cubic feet including storage under both the tailgate and the hood by way of comparison this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2014 bmw 5 series sedan and the approximately 18 cubic feet of storage available in the 2014 cadillac xts in addition we have designed model s to include a third row with two rearfacing child seats allowing us to offer seating for five adults and two children model s is also available with premium luxury features including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface advanced 

  

wireless connectivity such as 3g connectivity and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle we designed model s to be incorporate new functionality through wireless updates which allows us to continually improve model s over time model s has also achieved a five star safety rating we believe the combination of performance safety styling convenience and energy efficiency of model s positions it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments 

the 60 kwh and 85 kwh battery pack options of model s have an effective base price of 62400 and 72400 respectively in the united states assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles we also offer a performance version of model s for an effective base price of 85900 

we have designed model s to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class we consider the purchase price cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation we assume comparable residual values warranties insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a model s purchase in addition to the competitive pricing of model s relative to other premium vehicles we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs for example assuming an average of 15000 miles driven per year an average electricity cost of 118 cents per kilowatthour and an average gasoline price of 324 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the united states respectively for december 2013 and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of model s we estimate that our model s could save approximately 1800 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan in international markets where gasoline prices can be 23 times those of the united states the savings are greater furthermore we expect model s will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components including oil oil filters spark plugs and engine valves 

we have designed model s with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we intend to leverage to create future electric vehicle models including our model x in particular by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development in addition we believe our strategy of using currently available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options 

the tesla roadster 

our first vehicle the tesla roadster is the first highperformance electric sports car the twoseat convertible tesla roadster has a combination of range style performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today it can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little as 37 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour the tesla roadster also has a range of 245 miles on a single charge as determined using the united states epa’s combined twocycle cityhighway test we have sold approximately 2500 tesla roadsters to customers in over 30 countries predominately in north america and europe we concluded the production run of the tesla roadster in january 2012 

model x 

in february 2012 we revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as a dual motor allwheel drive system model x will seat seven adults we anticipate that we will make model x available with 60 kwh and 85 kwh battery pack options with pricing of each version similar to those of a comparably equipped model s we currently intend to target an initial annual production rate of approximately 20000 vehicles per year from our tesla factory we expect to have production design model x prototypes on the road by end of 

  

2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015 after its initial launch in the united states model x will be sold in all the markets where model s is available including in asia and europe 

gen iii 

we have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle to which we refer as “gen iii” to be produced at the tesla factory we intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our model s we expect that this vehicle will be produced in approximately three years 

powertrain development and sales 

in addition to our own vehicles we also design develop manufacture and sell advanced electric vehicle powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers 

we have provided development services and full powertrain systems and components to daimler for its smart fortwo aclass and bclass electric vehicles from may 2009 through december 2012 we provided approximately 2700 battery packs and chargers for the smart fortwo and aclass vehicles we have completed these programs and are now providing development services to daimler for its bclass electric vehicle we also have developed a full electric powertrain system for toyota for use in its rav4 ev and began shipping production systems to toyota in 2012 as of december 31 2013 we have shipped over 1600 units 

we are continuing to perform our electric powertrain component and systems sales and marketing activities principally out of our palo alto facility this facility which also serves as our corporate headquarters houses our research and development services including cell and component testing and prototyping as well as manufacturing of powertrain components for sales to third parties manufacturing of our powertrain components is performed at the tesla factory 

stationary energy storage applications 

in 2013 we developed stationary energy storage products for use in homes commercial sites and utilities the applications for these battery systems include backup power peak demand reduction demand response and wholesale electric market services we plan to ramp sales of these products in 2014 

technology 

we believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain vehicle engineering and innovative manufacturing our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain and the ability to design a vehicle which capitalizes on the uniqueness of an electric powertrain our electric powertrain consists of the following battery pack power electronics motor gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system we designed each of these major elements for our tesla roadster and model s and plan to use much of this technology in model x gen iii our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology further our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain these features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers 

battery pack 

we design our battery packs to safely store significant amounts of energy and to have long lives for example we have designed our tesla roadster battery packs to store 53 kilowatt hours of useful energy and to 

  

have an estimated life of over 100000 miles or seven years in addition we have designed our battery packs to be modular so that we can leverage technology developments across our different vehicles and products our proprietary technology includes cooling systems safety systems charge balancing systems battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability robotic manufacturing processes customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding reallife driving conditions we have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithiumion cells in the demanding automotive environment we believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatthour 

we believe one of our core competencies is the design of our complete battery pack system we have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry form factor and vendor that we adopt for battery cell supply in so doing we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the cost per kilowatthour of our battery pack we maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithiumion cell vendors and chemistry types we intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity longevity power delivery and cost we believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles we believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software electronics testing and vehicle packaging will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology 

the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage time and charging patterns customers’ use of their tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery’s ability to hold a charge for example we currently expect that the tesla roadster battery pack will retain approximately 70 of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100000 miles or seven years which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range in comparison with the roadster battery pack we expect that the retention rate of the model s battery pack is greater due to improvements at the battery cell and pack level in addition based on internal testing we estimate that the model s would have an approximate 510 reduction in range when operated continuously in 0°c temperatures 

to date we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries form factors and designs based on this evaluation we are presently using lithiumion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs we intend to use the same battery cell form factor in model x we entered into a supply agreement with panasonic corporation panasonic for the use of panasonic’s battery cells in model s and model x we expect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the tesla roadster 

power electronics 

the power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack the power electronics have two primary functions the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging 

the first function is accomplished through the drive inverter which converts direct current dc from the battery pack into alternating current ac to drive our threephase induction motors the drive inverter also converts the ac generated by regenerative braking back into dc for electrical storage in the battery pack the drive inverter performs this function by using a highperformance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle in so doing the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle 

  

the second function charging the battery pack is accomplished by the charger which converts alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery tesla vehicles can recharge on a variety of ac electrical outlets from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts up to a high power circuit of 80 amps and 240 volts which provides faster recharging the most common home charging system uses a 1450 type outlet at 40 amps and 240 volts to recharge at an epa equivalent rate of 29 miles per hour of charge time 

in the united states model s vehicles are delivered with an sae 1772 industry standard adapter that enables public ac charging at thousands of stations the european version of model s has an industry standard vehicle inlet connector that is also compatible with public charge stations around europe vehicles in both the united states and europe also come with the tesla mobile connector which enables charging from a variety of different outlets for customers who want a portable solution with maximum flexibility for the fastest possible charging we offer a highvoltage direct current option for model s that enables the vehicle to charge from tesla’s supercharger network superchargers are able to replenish 50 of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes of charge time this flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home 

vehicle control and infotainment software 

the performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software there are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors the flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle for example software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the “creep” feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator similar algorithms control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions we develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally 

vehicle design and engineering 

in addition to the design development and production of the powertrain we have created significant inhouse capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems we design and engineer bodies chassis interiors heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models 

several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle for example we redesigned the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine in addition low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio power windows and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle we have developed expertise in integrating these components with the highvoltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle 

additionally our team has expertise in lightweight materials a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range the tesla roadster is built with an internallydesigned carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass model s is built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle 

  

sales and marketing 

companyowned stores and galleries 

we market and sell cars directly to consumers through an international network of companyowned stores and galleries our tesla stores and galleries are highly visible premium outlets in major metropolitan markets some of which combine retail sales and service we have also found that opening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand as a result we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and personnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint we refer to these as “service plus” locations including our service plus locations we now operate a network of over 80 sales and gallery locations in north america europe and asia including all of our sales and service facilities we currently operate 116 locations we intend to grow our sales and service network by approximately 75 during the year ending december 31 2014 

we believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and service model our customers deal directly with our own teslaemployed sales and service staff creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers we believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing maintain and strengthen the tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback further we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer 

tesla supercharger network 

we are building a network of up to 120 kwh fast charging equipment each called a tesla supercharger throughout north america and europe for fast charging of model s the tesla supercharger is an industrial grade high speed charger designed to replenish 50 of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes supercharger stations are strategically placed along welltravelled highways to allow model s owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient minimal stops as of february 19 2014 we have 90 supercharger stations open in north america and europe in the united states we have implemented superchargers across a major transcontinental route as well as along key routes in the east and west coasts in europe superchargers enable long distance travel along key routes in norway the netherlands germany switzerland and austria access to the supercharger network is currently available free of charge to owners of model s vehicles with the 85 kwh battery pack options and when purchased as an upfront option for 60 kwh we are planning to methodically expand the supercharger network over the next few years in the united states europe and asia 

deposits and reservations 

we typically carry a limited inventory of our model s vehicles at our tesla stores while some customers may purchase their vehicles from this inventory most of our customers choose to customize the appearance of their vehicle we require a refundable 2500 deposit for these orders of our model s vehicles which is collected once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and has entered into a purchase agreement the refundable deposit becomes nonrefundable after two weeks we require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer 

for model x which is currently not in production we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least 5000 reservation payments and deposits are used by us to fund in part our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand 

  

marketing 

our principal marketing goals are to 

 

  

  

  

 historically we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles and we believe we will continue to do so to date media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs we also use traditional means of advertising including product placement in a variety of media outlets and payperclick advertisements on websites and applications relevant to our target demographics 

our marketing efforts include events where our vehicles are displayed and demonstrated these events range from widely attended public events such as the detroit los angeles and frankfurt auto shows to smaller events oriented towards sales such as private drive events 

service and warranty 

service 

we provide service for our electric vehicles at our companyowned service centers at our service plus locations or in certain areas for an additional charge through tesla ranger mobile technicians who provide services that do not require a vehicle lift we own and operate over 70 service locations as of february 19 2014 we are continuing our plan to build a number of additional service centers in several markets worldwide 

tesla roadster owners can upload data from their vehicle and send it to us on a memory card and model s is designed with the capability to wirelessly upload the data to us via an onboard gsm system allowing us to diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle when maintenance or service is required a customer can schedule service by contacting one of our tesla service centers our tesla rangers can also perform an array of services that do not require a vehicle lift from the convenience of a customer’s home or other remote location 

we believe that our companyowned service centers enable our technicians to work closely with our engineers and research and development teams in silicon valley to identify problems find solutions and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers 

new vehicle limited warranty maintenance and extended service plans 

for our model s customers we provide a four year or 50000 mile new vehicle limited warranty with every model s subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery the new vehicle limited warranty also covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125000 miles or unlimited miles depending on the size of the vehicle’s battery although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered 

in addition to the new vehicle limited warranty we offer a comprehensive maintenance program for model s which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles and an extended service plan the maintenance plans cover annual inspections 24 hour roadside assistance and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery with either a fixed fee per visit for tesla ranger service or unlimited tesla ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price the extended service plan 

  

covers the repair or replacement of model s parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the new vehicle limited warranty 

for our roadster customers we provided a three year or 36000 mile new vehicle limited warranty with every tesla roadster which we extended to four years or 50000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 tesla roadster customers have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty to cover the repair or replacement of roadster parts for up to an additional three years or 36000 miles provided they are purchased within a specified period of time we have previously provided our tesla roadster customers with a battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles 

our new vehicle limited warranties and extended service plans are subject to certain limitations exclusions or separate warranties including certain wear items such as tires brake pads paint and general appearance and battery performance and are intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems battery powertrain and brake system in addition all plans must be purchased within a specified period of time after vehicle purchase 

financial services 

we offer financial products through various financial institutions in the united states europe and asia in the united states and canada we offer customer loans through specified commercial banking partners in connection with certain of these loans we offer a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s and financed their vehicle under the program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a predetermined resale value this structure allows the customer to enjoy the benefits of model s ownership without concern for its resale value 

manufacturing 

we conduct our powertrain and vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at the tesla factory our integrated manufacturing facility in fremont california and at our facility in tilburg netherlands 

we manufacture model s and certain components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards for model s at the tesla factory the tesla factory contains several manufacturing operations including stamping machining casting plastics body assembly paint operations final vehicle assembly and endofline testing in addition we manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors gearboxes and components both for our vehicles and for our original equipment manufacturer customers at the tesla factory several major component systems of our vehicles are purchased from suppliers however we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at the tesla factory we also intend to produce the model x and our gen iii vehicle at the tesla factory 

we continue to ramp production at the tesla factory and believe that we will be able to continue to increase its production capacity through additional capital spending as well as by changing operating patterns and adding additional shifts in 2014 we intend to create new assembly and body shop lines which we have designed to manufacture both model s and model x 

for our vehicles delivered into the european union we conduct significant vehicle assembly and testing at our facilities in tilburg netherlands this facility also serves as a pan european parts warehouse and regional customer service center 

we have recently indicated our intention to build the tesla gigafactory a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material cell module and battery pack production in 

  

one location while we have not identified a final site for this facility we currently expect that it will be located in one of the following states arizona nevada new mexico or texas we currently expect the facility to be built on a lot between 500 and 1000 acres in size with up to approximately 10 million square feet of production space with one or two levels at full implementation the tesla gigafactory is expected to have 6500 dedicated tesla and production partner employees we currently plan to commence supplying battery packs manufactured at the tesla gigafactory for our vehicles including the gen iii vehicle and stationary storage applications in approximately three years the tesla gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020 which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500000 vehicles annually and stationary storage applications 

we believe that the tesla gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30 on a per kwh basis by the end of the first year of volume production of gen iii the total capital expenditures associated with the tesla gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be 45 billion of which approximately 2 billion is expected to come from tesla 

supply chain 

model s uses over 2000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 suppliers the majority of whom are currently our single source suppliers for these components we have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts while we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source 

to date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain longterm agreements with our suppliers while we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us for example while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have fully qualified only two cells from one supplier for these cells any disruption in the supply of either battery cells could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different cell is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative sources of supply on a timely basis moreover battery cell manufacturers may not supply us at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe 

we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials we believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements there are always risks and uncertainties however with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities or reasonable prices to meet our needs 

quality control 

our quality control efforts are divided between product quality and supplier quality both of which are focused on designing and producing products and processes with high levels of reliability our product quality engineers work with our engineering team and our suppliers to help ensure that the product designs meet functional specifications and durability requirements our supplier quality engineers work with our suppliers to ensure that their processes and systems are capable of delivering the parts we need at the required quality level on time and on budget 

  

customers and selected relationships 

we currently sell our cars primarily to individual customers we have strategic or commercial relationships with daimler toyota and panasonic 

daimler ag 

beginning in 2008 we commenced efforts on a powertrain development arrangement with daimler in may 2009 we entered into a development agreement with daimler under which we have performed specified research and development services for the development of a battery pack and charger for daimler’s smart fortwo electric drive all development work related to the development agreement had been completed as of december 31 2009 through december 2011 we had sold over 2100 battery packs and chargers for the smart fortwo electric drive program in the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 a formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with daimler in may 2010 in october 2010 we completed the development of the aclass battery pack and charger and began shipping production parts in february 2011 through december 2011 we sold over 500 battery packs and chargers for the aclass ev program in the first quarter of 2010 we completed the development and sale of modular battery packs for electric delivery vans for freightliner an affiliate of daimler freightliner plans to use these electric vans in a limited number of customer trials 

in the first half of 2012 we received two purchase orders from daimler related to the development of a full electric powertrain for the bclass mercedesbenz vehicle during the fourth quarter of 2012 we entered into a final development agreement for the bclass which includes certain development milestones and related payments we entered into an agreement for production parts for this bclass program in july 2013 we currently expect to substantially complete our development services under this program in early 2014 and to commence production of electric powertrains and battery packs to daimler shortly thereafter 

in addition to these agreements blackstar lnvestco llc blackstar an affiliate of daimler beneficially owned 4867929 shares of our common stock as of december 31 2013 

toyota motor corporation 

in may 2010 we and toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles and for us to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for model s in july 2010 we entered into an early phase agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with an aim by toyota to market the electric vehicle in the united states in 2012 prototypes would be made by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain we began developing and delivering prototypes to toyota for evaluation in september 2010 

in october 2010 we entered into a contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 we completed all of the development services for the rav4 ev in the first quarter of 2012 

additionally in july 2011 we entered into an agreement to supply toyota with electric powertrain system for the rav4 ev we began delivery of these systems to toyota for installation into the toyota rav4 ev in the first half of 2012 our production activities under this program are expected to continue through 2014 we expect to complete shipping electric powertrains for the current rav4 model by the end of this year 

in addition to these agreements in july 2010 we sold 2941176 shares of our common stock to toyota at our ipo price of 1700 per share 

  

panasonic 

panasonic is a supplier of battery cells for our battery packs in january 2010 we announced that we were collaborating with panasonic on the development of nextgeneration electric vehicle cells based on the 18650 form factor and nickelbased lithium ion chemistry in october 2011 we finalized a supply agreement for these battery cells the agreement supplies us with battery cells to build more than 80000 vehicles over the next four years in october 2013 we entered into an amendment to the supply agreement to among other things provide for the longterm preferential prices and a minimum of 18 billion lithiumion battery cells that we intend to purchase from panasonic from 2014 through 2017 

in november 2010 we sold 1418573 shares of our common stock to an entity affiliated with panasonic corporation at a price of 2115 per share 

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

full repayment of united states department of energy loans 

in may 2013 we paid 4518 million to settle all outstanding loan amounts due under a loan facility we had entered into with the federal financing bank ffb and the united states department of energy doe under the doe’s advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program as set forth in section 136 of the energy independence and security act of 2007 atvm program we refer to the loan facility with the doe as the doe loan facility 

under the doe loan facility the ffb had made available to us two multidraw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of 4650 million beginning on january 20 2010 as of august 31 2012 we had fully drawn down the aforementioned facilities on may 22 2013 we paid 4518 million to fully retire our obligations under the doe loan facility 

in connection with the closing of the doe loan facility we had also issued a warrant to the doe to purchase up to 9255035 shares of our series e convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of 251 per share upon the completion of our initial public offering on july 2 2010 this preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase up to 3090111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 754 per share as a result of our repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the doe loan facility and the termination of the doe loan facility in may 2013 the doe warrant expired additionally we amortized all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the doe loan facility 

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives 

in december 2009 we finalized an arrangement with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority caeatfa that resulted in an exemption from california state sales and use taxes for 320 million of manufacturing equipment as the equipment purchased would otherwise have been subject to california state sales and use tax we believe this incentive resulted in tax savings by us of approximately 31 million over the period starting in december 2009 and ending in december 2013 the equipment purchases were used only for three purposes i to establish our production facility for model s in california ii to upgrade our palo alto powertrain production facility and iii to expand our current tesla roadster assembly operations at our menlo park facility in january 2012 we finalized an additional agreement with caeatfa that will result in an exclusion from california state sales and use taxes for up to 292 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales or use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately 24 million over the period starting in december 2011 and ending in december 2015 the equipment purchases may be used only for two purposes i to develop model x and its production capacity in california and ii to further upgrade our powertrain production facilities in california in december 2013 we exhausted all funds from the december 2009 approved exemption from california state sales and use taxes for 

  

320 million of manufacturing equipment also in december 2013 we finalized an additional agreement with caeatfa that will result in an exclusion from california state sales and use taxes for up to 415 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales or use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately 35 million over the period starting in december 2013 and ending in december 2016 the equipment purchases may be used only for three purposes i to expand model s manufacturing capacity in california ii to expand electric vehicle powertrain production in california and iii model s future electric vehicle development 

regulatory credits 

in connection with the production delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers 

under california’s zeroemission vehicle regulations and those of states that have adopted the california standards vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in those states during each model year are zero emission vehicles and partial zero emission vehicles currently the states of arizona california connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new jersey new mexico new york oregon rhode island and vermont have such laws in effect these laws provide that a manufacturer of may earn credits referred to as zev credits if they produce more zero emission vehicles than the minimum quantity required by those laws those manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell those excess credits to other manufacturers who can then apply such credits to comply with the regulatory requirements including making up for deficits as a manufacturer of solely of zero emission vehicles we have no minimum requirement and as a result we earn zev credits on each vehicle delivered and placed into service in such states we have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the zev credits that we earn recently california passed amendments to the zev mandate that would require all large volume manufacturers those manufacturers selling 20000 or more vehicles in california in 2018 to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold starting in 2018 under the new requirements by 2025 up to 154 of each large volume manufacturers’ fleet must be made of zero emission vehicles all states that have adopted the california program will amend their programs to conform to the new california standards 

additionally under the environmental protection agency’s epa national greenhouse gas ghg emission standards and similar standards adopted by the canadian government vehicle manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average carbon dioxide emissions standards for cars and trucks those manufacturers whose fleet wide average fails to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile those manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements as a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles we earn the full amount of ghg credits established by the standards on each vehicle sold we have entered into agreements with another automobile manufacturer to sell the credits that we earn 

under the national highway traffic safety administration’s nhtsa corporate average fuel economy cafe standards vehicle manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average fuel economy standards for cars and trucks those manufacturers whose fleetwide average fails to meet such standards have a deficit in their fuel economy profile those manufacturers whose fleetwide average performs better than such standards may earn credits manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements we have entered into agreements to sell the credits that we earn 

we have entered into contracts for the sale of regulatory credits with several automotive manufacturers for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we earned revenue from the sale of regulatory credits of 1944 million 405 million and 27 million respectively we earned revenue from the sale of zev credits specifically over the same time periods of 1298 million 324 million and 27 million 

  

regulation—vehicle safety and testing 

our vehicles are subject to and the tesla roadster complies with or is exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss the model s fully complies with all fmvsss without the need for any exemptions as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that a vehicle meets or otherwise obtain an exemption from all applicable fmvsss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard before the vehicle can be imported into or sold in the united states there are numerous fmvsss that apply to our vehicles examples of these requirements include 

 

  

  

  

  

 due to the limited number of roadsters originally produced we applied for and were granted exemptions from certain advanced air bag and electronic stability control requirements which applied to tesla roadsters manufactured through november 7 2011 for model s we have certified the vehicle as compliant with all us safety standards without exemptions under us law we are required to certify compliance with or obtain exemption from all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the united states based on testing engineering analysis and other information we have certified that the tesla roadster complies with or is exempt from all applicable nhtsa standards in effect at the time of manufacture by affixing a certification label to each tesla roadster sold based on testing engineering analysis and other information we have certified the model s as complying with all applicable nhtsa standards in effect at the time of manufacture by affixing a certification label to each model s sold 

we are also required to comply with other requirements of federal laws administered by nhtsa including the corporate average fuel economy standards theft prevention act requirements consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements 

our vehicles sold in europe are subject to european union safety testing regulations many of those regulations referred to as european union whole vehicle type approval wvta are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the united states and may require redesign andor retesting for model s we successfully completed full eu wvta homologation and received approval last year by the rdw the dutch type approval authority due to reciprocity agreements in place throughout the european union rdw’s type approval is valid in the entire eu we have also sought and received type approval for noneu european countries including switzerland iceland and norway we also plan to introduce model s vehicles in other markets such as china japan and australia we successfully demonstrated and received type approval for delivery of 85kwh equipped model s vehicles to china plans are currently underway to obtain type approval for the 60kwh equipped model s vehicle in china and both battery pack variants for markets in japan and australia including a forthcoming righthand drive version 

  

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition the act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted 

regulation—epa emissions  certificate of conformity 

the clean air act requires that we obtain a certificate of conformity issued by the epa and a california executive order issued by the california air resources board carb with respect to emissions for our vehicles including model s the certificate of conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the clean air act’s standards and both the certificate of conformity and the executive order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the epa to utilize california standards the california standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in california are set by carb states that have adopted the california standards as approved by epa also recognize the executive order for sales of vehicles 

regulation—battery safety and testing 

our battery pack conforms with mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation which includes lithiumion batteries the governing regulations which are issued by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa are based on the un recommendations on the safe transport of dangerous goods model regulations and related un manual tests and criteria the regulations vary by mode of transportation when these items are shipped such as by ocean vessel rail truck or by air 

we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the un manual of tests and criteria including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we also subject our battery packs to the appropriate tests specified in the society of automotive engineers sae j2464 and j2929 which include further tests such as immersion humidity and exposure to fire 

we use lithium metal oxide cells in our battery packs the cells do not contain any lead mercury cadmium or other hazardous materials heavy metals or any toxic materials our battery packs include certain packaging materials which contain trace amounts of various hazardous chemicals whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs if a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation 

state law regulates the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally requires motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed to the extent possible we plan to secure dealer licenses or the equivalent of a dealer license and engage in activities as a motor vehicle dealer in so far as we are permitted to do so as we open additional tesla stores and service centers some states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer to sell vehicles to residents of states 

  

where we are not licensed as a dealer to the extent permitted by local law both the actual sale would generally have to occur out of state in this scenario it is possible that activities related to marketing advertising taking orders taking reservations and reservation payments and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state’s motor vehicle industry laws regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities 

in jurisdictions where we do not have a tesla store a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet however some states have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state in order to sell vehicles to its residents in some states where we have opened a viewing “gallery” that is not a full retail location it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer laws although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance a state could also take action against us including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities in addition some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities 

the foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we face as we sell our vehicles in many states the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent particularly with respect to sales over the internet and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state how the sale transaction is structured the volume of sales into the state and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers as a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state 

moreover as we expand our footprint in the united states dealer associations have been bringing litigation challenging the legality of our operations as well as trying to use administrative and legislative processes to shut down our ability to expand and even threatening existing operations although we have prevailed in every lawsuit brought by these dealer associations in massachusetts new york and ohio we expect that additional challenges will be brought in addition dealer associations are actively lobbying governors and legislators to interpret laws or enact new laws not favorable to tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations 

furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time 

in addition to licensing laws specific laws and regulations in each of the states and their interpretation by regulators may limit or determine how we sell market advertise and otherwise solicit sales take orders take reservations and reservation payments deliver and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state while we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have tesla stores we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there 

  

may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices 

competition 

competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving we believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for occupant safety and vehicle emissions technological advances in powertrain and consumer electronics components and shifting customer needs and expectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electricbased vehicles we believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology within the electricbased vehicle segment there are three primary means of powertrain electrification which will differentiate various competitors in this market 

 

  

  

 the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future prior to the introduction of the nissan leaf in december 2010 no mass produced performance highwaycapable electric vehicles were being sold in the united states in japan mitsubishi has been selling its electric imiev since april 2010 we expect additional competitors to enter the alternate fuel vehicle market within the next several years and as they do so we expect that we will experience significant competition in addition we currently face strong competition from existing automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes 

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market in addition to the nissan leaf ford has introduced the fully electric ford focus renault has introduced the fully electric renault fluence and fiat has introduced the fiat 500e among others moreover bmw daimler lexus audi fiat renault volkswagen and volvo are also developing electric 

  

vehicles for example bmw plans to introduce its i3 city car and i8 sports car in the second quarter of 2014 and volkswagen plans to introduce its fully electric egolf in 2014 several new startups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles although none of these have yet come to market finally electric vehicles have already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well 

in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles for example in december 2010 general motors introduced the chevrolet volt which is a plugin hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery 

most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do in addition almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design develop market and sell their products more effectively we believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components as well as our history of vehicle development and production are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition however we have a limited history of operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends at least in part on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of patents patent applications trade secrets including knowhow employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws trademarks intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology as of december 31 2013 we had 203 issued patents and more than 280 pending patent applications with the united states patent and trademark office and internationally in a broad range of areas our issued patents start expiring in 2026 we intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims even if granted there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection 

segment information 

we have determined that we operate as one reporting segment which is the design development manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles and electric powertrain components for information regarding financial data by geographic areas see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had 5859 fulltime employees none of our employees are currently represented by labor unions or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment to date we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business and industry 

we may be unable to sustain our current level of production and deliveries of model s or increase production and deliveries in line with our plans both of which could harm our business and prospects 

we began manufacturing and delivering model s in june 2012 we have limited experience to date in high volume manufacturing of our electric vehicles as we only recently reached full production of model s for the us market and have just recently begun production of model s for the european and asian markets our ability to further rampup high volume model s production will depend upon a number of factors including our suppliers’ ability to deliver quality parts to us in a timely manner our ability to use our manufacturing processes as planned for volume production while maintaining our desired quality levels and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high quality the model s is an all new vehicle which we are producing with new employees using new equipment and therefore our production processes are still maturing to produce a vehicle that meets our quality standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality levels to meet our demand certain suppliers have experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints any disruption in maintaining our production level of model s could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we have only recently increased our model s delivery rates in the united states to match our current and anticipated model s production capacity we have limited experience in the high volume delivery of our model s vehicles we have gradually ramped production of model s and we intend to continue to increase the production rate significantly over the next several quarters furthermore we have only recently commenced deliveries in europe and have not delivered model s vehicles outside of north america and europe in volume thus we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in asia and other right hand drive markets later this year which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals if we are unable to increase the production rate and increase our weekly delivery rate to match our production rate of model s ramp up deliveries in europe and asia and sustain a high level of weekly model s deliveries throughout the year this could result in negative publicity damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

in addition for model s we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques such as aluminum spot welding systems which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry and model s has a number of new and unique design features such as a 17 inch display screen newly designed retractable exterior door handles and a panoramic roof each of which poses unique manufacturing challenges model s production and 

  

deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for model s or cause us to miss planned production targets any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results additionally sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that avoids significant cost overruns including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors may be difficult 

our ability to sustain and grow volume production and deliveries for model s is subject to certain risks and uncertainties including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 finally detailed longterm testing of quality reliability and durability testing of model s are ongoing and any negative results from such testing could cause production or delivery delays cost increases or lower quality of our model s vehicles 

we are dependent on our suppliers the vast majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to continue to deliver or their refusal to deliver necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

model s contains numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 direct suppliers the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components while we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturers the majority of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from single sources to date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not maintain longterm agreements with a number of our suppliers 

while we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us in particular while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate 

  

sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle’s design 

this supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for model s as well as for our powertrain component sales activities for example earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in japan in march 2011 could negatively impact our supply chain we have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains including those relating to our slowerthananticipated ramp in our model s production goals for 2012 we may experience additional delays in the future with respect to model s and any other future vehicle we may produce in addition because we have written agreements in place with the majority but not all of our suppliers this may create uncertainty regarding certain suppliers’ obligations to us including but not limited to those regarding warranty and product liability changes in business conditions wars governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis furthermore if we experience significantly increased demand or need to replace certain existing suppliers there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us at all or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner in the past we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost and delay we have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made and we may experience similar cost increases in the future additionally we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer additionally cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal production processes thereby harming model s quality or reducing model s production output 

furthermore a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our performance electric vehicles such as model s could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

finally in october 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with panasonic corporation in order to address our anticipated short to mediumterm lithium ion battery cell needs while we expect that this supply agreement as amended will provide us with sufficient cells for the next few years we may not be able to meet our longterm needs including for our third generation electric vehicle which we refer as “gen iii” and other programs we may introduce without securing additional suppliers or other sources for cells if we cannot secure such additional suppliers or sources we could experience production delays which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing costs of model s or otherwise control the costs associated with operating our business our financial condition and operating results will suffer 

our production costs for model s were high initially due to startup costs at the tesla factory manufacturing inefficiencies including low absorption of fixed manufacturing costs higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain and higher initial prices for component parts during the initial period after the launch and ramp of model s as we have gradually ramped production of model s manufacturing costs per 

  

vehicle have fallen while we expect further cost reduction efforts undertaken by both us and our suppliers will continue to reduce costs during the next several quarters there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve planned cost reductions from our various cost savings initiatives and the failure to achieve such savings would negatively affect our ability to reach our gross margin and profitability goals 

we incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our highperformance electric cars assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel we may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of model s and powertrain manufacturing facilities and the planned launch in asia in the spring of 2014 furthermore if we are unable to produce model x pursuant to our plan due to cost overruns or other unexpected costs we may not be able to meet our gross margin targets 

additionally in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles including through the use of traditional media such as television radio and print even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited as we have to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts if we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate our operating results business and prospects will be harmed furthermore many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control for example the costs of our raw materials and components such as lithiumion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases indeed if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology shortages could occur which would result in increased material costs to us or potentially limit our ability to expand production 

our longterm success will be dependent upon our ability to design build and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models specifically model s and new vehicle models such as model x and gen iii in the us and abroad 

our longterm success is dependent on market acceptance of the model s sedan and future electric vehicles we introduce in the united states there is no guarantee that model s will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public especially in the longterm as we expand in europe and enter into asia there is no guarantee that customers in these markets will embrace our vehicles and if they do not demand for our vehicles could be lower than our expectations for example we have experienced greater initial success in selling model s vehicles in norway than in the rest of europe 

moreover there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models including the model x crossover will become commercially viable to date we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of the model x to the extent that we are not able to build model x to the expectations created by the early prototype and our announced specifications customers may cancel their reservations our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us 

in addition we have also announced our intent to develop gen iii which we expect to produce at the tesla factory after the introduction of model x we intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our model s importantly we anticipate producing our gen iii vehicle for the mass market and thus we will need a highvolume supply of lithiumion cells at reasonable prices while our plan is to attempt to produce lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for our gen iii vehicles at a new tesla gigafactory our plans for such production are at a very early stage and we have not yet selected a site for the construction of the tesla gigafactory nor completed a factory design in addition we have no experience in the production of lithiumion cells and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production and to date we have not formalized such partnerships in addition the cost of building and operating the tesla gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the tesla gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate if we are unable to build the tesla gigafactory in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithiumion cells for gen iii at reasonable prices and thus are forced to rely on others to 

  

supply us with lithiumion cells for gen iii our ability to produce our gen iii vehicles at a price that allows us to sell gen iii profitably could be constrained finally we have very limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple models of vehicles such as model s including any variants we may introduce such as righthand drive model x and gen iii while we intend each of our production vehicles and their variants to meet a distinct segment of the automotive market our vehicles may end up competing with each other which may delay sales and associated revenue to future periods also if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of our vehicles this could result in inefficient expenditures and production delays furthermore historically automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently in order to meet these expectations we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models as technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology and meet customer expectations to date we have limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing upgrading adapting and selling our electric vehicles 

our future growth is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles 

our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular if the market for electric vehicles in the us europe and asia does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new rapidly evolving characterized by rapidly changing technologies price competition additional competitors evolving government regulation and industry standards frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors 

other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles and specifically electric vehicles include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles and based on our own internal testing we estimate that our vehicles may experience a material reduction in range when operated in extremely cold temperatures to the extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain widespread acceptance our ability to market and sell our vehicles particularly in colder climates may be adversely impacted 

additionally we will become subject to regulations that require us to alter the design of our vehicles which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicles for example our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles due to concerns about quiet vehicles and vision impaired pedestrians in january 2011 congress passed and the president signed the pedestrian safety enhancement act of 2010 the new law requires nhtsa to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds nhtsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2013 and plans to finalize a rule as soon as sometime in 2014 with an effective date that could be implemented by september 1 2015 this will begin a three year phasein schedule for establishing these minimum sounds in all electric and hybrid electric vehicles adding this artificial noise may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles which would materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and prospects 

if we fail to manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company especially internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our vehicles successfully 

any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we continue to expand our operations significantly in the us as well as in europe and asia our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully risks that we face in undertaking this global expansion include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel including manufacturing personnel design personnel engineers and service technicians for our performance electric vehicles because our highperformance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines we may not be able to hire individuals with sufficient training in performance electric vehicles and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire competition for individuals with experience designing manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense and we may not be able to attract assimilate train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future the failure of which could seriously harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition 

our limited experience with our product offerings makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult 

we were formed in july 2003 and began delivering our first vehicle the tesla roadster in early 2008 we only began producing our second electric vehicle model s in june 2012 and our production processes continue to mature especially those production processes related to our model s deliveries in europe and our planned deliveries in asia such as for righthand drive model s model s became the primary contributor to our revenue starting in the fourth quarter of 2012 we intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of model s model x gen iii and future electric vehicles further we have only produced an early prototype of the model x crossover and have only recently started production of model s for asia our vehicle design and our engineering manufacturing and component supply plans for model s may continue to be adjusted 

in addition our powertrain component sales development services revenue and powertrain research and development compensation have been almost entirely generated under arrangements with daimler ag daimler and toyota motor corporation toyota and there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into future agreements with these or other companies on favorable terms or manufacture and deliver powertrain components in a manner that is costeffective to us 

finally it is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which would cause our stock price to decline 

we occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections regarding the number of vehicles we hope to sell or produce in future periods and anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows correctly identifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process our guidance is based in part on assumptions which include but are not limited to assumptions regarding 

 

  

  

 such guidance may not always be accurate or may vary from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors or because of the way that applicable accounting rules require us to treat new product and service offerings that we may offer we offer no assurance that such guidance will ultimately be accurate and investors should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution if we fail to meet our guidance or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance even if such failure or revision is 

  

seemingly insignificant investors and analysts may lose confidence in us and the market value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 

our vehicles make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns and future events may lead to additional concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications 

the battery pack in the tesla roadster and model s makes use of lithiumion cells we also currently intend to make use of lithiumion cells in battery packs that we sell to toyota and daimler as well as any future vehicles we may produce on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells extremely rare incidents of laptop computers cell phones and electric vehicle battery packs catching fire have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells 

these events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications to address these questions and concerns a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithiumion battery cell chemistries to improve safety we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells however we have delivered only a limited number of tesla roadsters and model s sedans to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles especially model s we have also only delivered a limited number of battery packs to toyota and daimler accordingly there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our model s or other battery packs that we produce will not occur which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits we may have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains our battery packs and redesign our battery packs which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithiumion cells such as a vehicle or other fire even if such incident does not involve us could seriously harm our business 

in addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our manufacturing facility any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall moreover any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to the tesla roadster or model s may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

if our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains fail to perform as expected or if we suffer product recalls for model s our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed 

our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains such as the toyota rav4 ev or the upcoming mercedesbenz bclass ev may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair for example our vehicles use a substantial amount of software code to operate software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced and changes to software may have unexpected effects model s issues experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery although we are attempting to remedy the model s issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner by expanding our service centers and personnel such efforts may not be timely or up to the satisfaction of our customers 

while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the longterm performance of our battery packs powertrains and vehicles specifically we have only a limited amount of data by which to evaluate model s upon which our business prospects depend due to the fact that we only recently began production in june 2012 there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers 

  

we have experienced product recalls including in may 2009 october 2010 and june 2013 all of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain in may 2009 we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider which is the partially assembled tesla roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain in october 2010 we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in june 2013 we initiated a recall of slightly more than a thousand model s vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position failure of this component may have resulted in the collapse of the rear seat back during a crash although the cost of this recall was not material and limited to a small number of total model s’s produced we may experience additional recalls in the future which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets as well as our business prospects and results of operations 

moreover in january 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain universal mobile connector nema 1450 adapters which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves potentially overheating during charging we further announced that we will provide upgraded nema 1450 adapters to our customers as an additional safeguard if such measures do not adequately address the underlying concerns however or if the public perceives such steps to be an indication of safety concerns about the vehicles our business prospects and results of operations could be harmed 

our electric vehicles may not perform consistent with customers’ expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available for example our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market additionally while model s recently achieved an overall five star safety rating by nhtsa such rating is not a guarantee of safe product design or that any individual vehicle will be free of any defect or failure any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity lost revenue delivery delays product recalls product liability claims harm to our brand and reputation and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

we have a history of losses and have to deliver significant cost reductions to achieve sustained longterm profitability and longterm commercial success 

we have had net losses on a gaap basis in each quarter since our inception except for the first quarter of 2013 even if we are able to successfully maintain our current model s production levels there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful in order to maintain profitability as well as longterm commercial success we must continue to achieve our planned cost reductions and control our operational costs while producing quality model s vehicles at volume maintain and increase our model s delivery rates to match our current and anticipated model s production capacity maintain strong demand for model s in the us and grow demand for model s abroad in europe and asia failure to do one or more of these things could prevent us from achieving sustained longterm profitability 

the introduction of our resale value guarantee may result in lower revenues and profits and exposes us to resale risk to the extent many customers elect to return their vehicles to us and the residual values of these cars are below the guaranteed value 

we recently began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and canada and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners under the program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months following delivery for a predetermined resale value as a result of this resale value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their vehicles to us we apply lease accounting to such purchases which 

  

defers the recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of full recognition at vehicle delivery during the fourth quarter of 2013 we provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 40 of model s deliveries in the united states and we expect the penetration rate to increase with the expansion of our financing programs in additional states in the united states and in international markets although the resale value guarantee does not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery a significant uptake under this program could have a significant adverse impact on our near term gaap revenues and operating results furthermore while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles’ resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could impact our future cash flows andor profitability currently there is only a very limited secondary market for our electric vehicles in particular and electric vehicles in general on which to base our estimates and such a secondary market may not develop in the future our residual value and return volume estimates could prove to be incorrect either of which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials in particular lithiumion cells could harm our business 

we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials any such increase or supply interruption could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells these risks include 

 

  

  

  

 our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles’ battery packs as well as for the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers while we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendors could disrupt production of model s and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices there can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices any attempts to increase model s prices in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by our customers result in cancellations of model s reservations and could materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results 

  

our success could be harmed by negative publicity regarding our company or our products particularly model s 

occasionally third parties evaluate or publish stories regarding our vehicles for example in 2013 the new york times published a review of the model s and our supercharger network on a route from washington dc to boston despite instructions to the contrary the reporter did not follow all recommendations including failing to fully recharge the vehicle at one of the two supercharger locations along the route as a result the model s failed to complete the journey under its own power and the ny times reporter published a negative review while there were subsequent corrections by the ny times public editor regarding the reporter’s failure to conform to all tesla recommendations as well as problems with “precision and judgment” the original story still created a negative public perception about model s its capabilities and the supercharger network such comments can and did negatively impact sales in that region in addition citation to the original ny times article has continued long after its publication to the extent that these comments are believed by the public this may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles including model s and model x which can materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial conditions and prospects 

our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers which makes evaluating our business operating results and future prospects difficult 

our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today particularly in the united states we plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles in companyowned tesla stores and over the internet this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven especially in the united states and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires in the aggregate a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system for example we will not be able to utilize longestablished sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume which may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results moreover we will be competing with companies with wellestablished distribution channels 

we have opened tesla stores in the united states europe and the asia pacific region many of which have been open for only a short period of time we have relatively limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our tesla stores our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges the concept and layout of our interactive stores which are typically located in high profile retail centers is different than what has previously been used in automotive sales we do not know whether our store strategy will continue to be successful we may incur additional costs in order to improve or change our retail strategy 

other aspects of our distribution model also differ from those used by traditional automobile manufacturers for example we do not anticipate that we will ever carry a significant amount of model s inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they place an order until the time they receive their vehicle this type of custom manufacturing is unusual in the premium sedan market in the united states and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle if customers do not embrace this ordering and retail experience our business will be harmed 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number 

  

of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles including model s a successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results we selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and financial condition we may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under such a policy 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems if these implementations are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems to assist us in the management of our business in particular our volume production of model s in the us and abroad necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems these systems support our operations and enable us to produce model s in volume the implementation maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement processes manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes that may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations we cannot be sure that these expanded systems or their required functionality will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis if at all or maintained if we do not successfully implement improve or maintain these systems our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed in addition these systems or their functionality may not operate as we expect them to and we may be required to expend significant resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

we may not realize the benefits of our supercharger network which could harm our business brand and operating results 

we have only recently started to deploy tesla superchargers in the united states and europe tesla superchargers are a network of charging stations designed to provide fastcharge capability to owners of model s vehicles with the supercharging option we intend to expand the tesla supercharger network throughout the us canada europe and asia but we may be unable to do so due to a number of factors including the inability to secure or delays in securing suitable locations and permits problems negotiating leases with landowners or obtaining required permits for such locations difficulties in interfacing with the infrastructures of various utility companies and greater than expected costs and difficulties of installing maintaining and operating the network 

we may also be unable to expand the supercharger network as fast as we intend or as the public expects or to place the charging stations in places our customers believe to be optimal furthermore even where superchargers exist the increasing number of model s vehicles may oversaturate the available charging bays at such superchargers leading to increased wait times and dissatisfaction for customers in addition as we have announced that we will not be charging our customers to access this network in addition to what they have already paid for their vehicles any significant unexpected costs that we encounter will entirely be borne by us and may harm our operating results although our supercharger network is intended to address customer concerns regarding longdistance travel this network may not result in increased reservations or sales of model s 

  

or future vehicles if our supercharger network is not expanded as currently planned or as quickly as planned we may not realize the benefits of our supercharger network and our business and operating results could be materially affected 

if we are unable to design develop market and sell new electric vehicles that address additional market opportunities our business prospects and operating results will suffer 

we may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles address new market segments or develop a significantly broader customer base in 2012 we publicly revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform we have also announced our intent to develop gen iii based on a smaller platform than the model s which we expect to produce at the tesla factory after the introduction of model x the gen iii is currently planned to be a lower cost smaller sedan designed for the mass market therefore we intend to the manufacture gen iii in significantly higher volumes than model s and there can be no assurance we can successfully scale our business accordingly in addition we have not yet finalized the design engineering or component sourcing plans for gen iii and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring this vehicle to market at the price point and in the volume that we currently intend if at all the market for vehicles in the price range we expect for gen iii is much more competitive than for models s and x and therefore margins are likely to be lower compared to model s margins our efforts to manufacture and sell a sufficiently profitable gen iii may not be as successful and therefore our business prospects and operating results may suffer our failure to address additional market opportunities would harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we may experience significant delays in the design manufacture and launch of model x which could harm our business and prospects 

we expect to have model x prototypes with production design on the road by the end of 2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015 any significant delay in the design manufacture and launch of model x could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results automobile manufacturers often experience delays in the design manufacture and commercial release of new vehicle models we experienced significant delays in launching the tesla roadster which resulted in additional costs and adverse publicity for our business in 2012 we also experienced delays in the ramp of model s we may experience further delays in launching model x which may result in cost overruns and adverse publicity we are in the design and development stages of model x furthermore we have not yet evaluated qualified or selected all of our suppliers for the planned production of model x we may not be able to engage suppliers for the components in a timely manner at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that model x is in compliance with applicable nhtsa safety regulations and obtain epa and carb certification to emission regulations prior to beginning volume production and delivery of the vehicles in addition we have limited resources and to the extent that such engineering and manufacturing resources are devoted to model s or are otherwise engaged such as in development services activities we may have difficulty designing and delivering model x in a timely manner if we are not able to manufacture and deliver model x in a timely manner and consistent with our production timeline budget and cost projections our business prospects operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed 

the automotive market is highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in this industry we currently face competition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future other automobile manufacturers entered the electric vehicle market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter this market with respect to model s we face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes 

  

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market mitsubishi has been selling its fully electric imiev in japan since april 2010 and nissan has been selling the fully electric nissan leaf since december 2010 in the past few years ford has introduced the fully electric ford focus renault has introduced the fully electric renault fluence and fiat has introduced the fiat 500e among others moreover bmw intends to introduce the fully electric bmw i3 in the second quarter of 2014 and volkswagen plans to introduce its fully electric egolf and in 2014 in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles for example in december 2010 general motors introduced the chevrolet volt which is a plugin hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack 

moreover it has been reported that many of the other large oems such as daimler lexus and audi are also developing electric vehicles several new startups have also entered or announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles finally electric vehicles have already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well 

most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do in addition almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design develop market and sell their products more effectively additionally we have not in the past and do not currently offer customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do 

we expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry factors affecting competition include product quality and features innovation and development time pricing reliability safety fuel economy customer service and financing terms increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and prospects our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets if our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality price or performance of our cars or services we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results 

volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition the markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods for example according to automotive industry sources sales of passenger vehicles in north america during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30 lower than those during the same period in the prior year demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general economic political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies as a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand as our business grows economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we currently or will sell 

  

our electric vehicles such as europe and asia will impact our business prospects and operating results as well demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives prices of raw materials and parts and components cost of fuel and governmental regulations including tariffs import regulation and other taxes volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results these effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers 

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to the seasonality of our business fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors 

our operating results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to many factors including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles demand for new cars in the automobile industry typically declines over the winter season while sales are generally higher during the spring and summer months sales of the tesla roadster fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters we note that in general automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of model s and future models may have similar seasonality however our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business also any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue 

in addition we expect our periodtoperiod operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we among other things design develop and manufacture model x and future products increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes develop the tesla gigafactory open new tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities open new supercharger locations increase our sales and marketing activities and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results especially in the shortterm are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors if any of this occurs the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time 

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industry then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially 

our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support if we were to cease or cut back operations even years from now buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support as a result consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed if we are required to curtail our expansion plans in the future as we have done in the past this may result in negative perceptions regarding our longterm business prospects and may lead to cancellations of model s or model x orders and reservations 

accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts and other parties in our liquidity and longterm business prospects in contrast to some more 

  

established automakers we believe that in our case the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed 

we may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

the design manufacture sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will provide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans however until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows if the costs for developing and manufacturing model x exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new significant strategic investments such as the tesla gigafactory we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions this capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects including those for our planned model x crossover and gen iii vehicle establish sales and service centers build and deploy superchargers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model x we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we have limited experience servicing our vehicles and we are using a different service model from the one typically used in the industry if we are unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers and meet customer expectations regarding service our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected we have limited experience servicing our vehicles servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills including high voltage training and servicing techniques if we are unable to satisfactorily service our customers and the various service related issues that they are facing and may face in the future our ability to generate customer loyalty grow our business and sell additional model s vehicles could be impaired 

we service our performance electric vehicles through our companyowned tesla service centers certain of our stores and through our mobile service technicians known as the tesla rangers however certain service centers have been open for short periods and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these locations we will need to open new standalone service centers and hire and train significant numbers of new 

  

employees to staff these service centers and act as tesla rangers in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles we only implemented our tesla rangers program in october 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers’ vehicles there can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases 

we do not expect to be able to open tesla service centers in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside in order to address the service needs of customers who are not in geographical proximity to our service centers we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile tesla rangers to service the vehicles at the customer’s location these special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers in addition a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network if we do not adequately address our customers’ service needs our brand and reputation will be adversely affected which in turn could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

traditional automobile manufacturers in the united states do not provide maintenance and repair services directly consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers we do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles at this point we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future as our vehicles are placed in more locations we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales thereby harming our business and prospects 

in addition the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain while we believe our tesla ranger program and our practice of shipping customers’ vehicles to our nearest tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in these circumstances without seeking formal regulatory guidance there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states further certain state franchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service if issues arise in connection with these laws certain aspects of tesla’s service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law which may harm our business 

we may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the tesla brand which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business revenues and prospects 

our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand any failure to develop maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the model s model x gen iii and other future planned electric vehicles and sell our electric powertrain components if we do not continue to establish maintain and strengthen our brand we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and repair services and we have very limited experience in these areas any problems associated with the toyota rav4 ev that uses a tesla powertrain the mercedesbenz bclass ev that will use a tesla powertrain or the model x may hurt the tesla brand 

  

in addition we expect that our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts to date we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand to further promote our brand we may be required to change our marketing practices which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses including the need to use traditional media such as television radio and print the automobile industry is intensely competitive and we may not be successful in building maintaining and strengthening our brand many of our current and potential competitors particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in detroit japan and the european union have greater name recognition broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do if we do not develop and maintain a strong brand our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

if our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products the vehicle may not operate properly which could harm our business 

automobile enthusiasts may seek to “hack” our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems also we are aware of customers who have customized their vehicles with aftermarket parts that may compromise driver safety for example some customers have installed seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised other customers have changed wheels and tires while others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle we have not tested nor do we endorse such changes or products in addition customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customers to injury from high voltage electricity such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our deposits for model s and reservations for model x may be refundable to customers and significant cancellations could harm our financial condition and business prospects 

as of december 31 2013 we had 1632 million in customer deposits primarily for model s and model x model s deposits are generally subject to cancellation by the customer and fully refundable up until two weeks after placing the order model x reservations are fully refundable until such time when customers begin to configure their vehicles for delivery we have experienced order cancellations for our vehicles and have had to refund the related deposits and cancellations may continue 

given the lead times that we have historically experienced between customer reservation and delivery on the tesla roadster and on model s and that we expect to experience on model x there is risk that customers who have placed orders or made reservations for our vehicles may cancel such orders or reservations and not ultimately take delivery on vehicles due to potential changes in customer preferences competitive developments and other factors 

additionally if we encounter delays in our planned launch and ramp in asia or further delays in the introduction of model x a significant number of our customers could similarly cancel their orders or reservations and demand refunds of their deposits as a result no assurance can be made that orders and reservations will not be cancelled and will ultimately result in the final purchase delivery and sale of the vehicle 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles in addition we may not be able to open stores or service centers in certain states or superchargers in desired locations 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales 

  

of our electric vehicles this ongoing global expansion may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore there can be no assurances that we will be able to expand on the budget or timeline we have established we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale and service of our vehicles in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delays in expanding our network of tesla stores service centers and superchargers this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have opened tesla stores and service centers in major metropolitan areas throughout north america europe and asia and we plan to open additional stores and service centers worldwide to support our ongoing worldwide model s rollout we have also rapidly expanded our supercharger network in the us and europe however we may not be able to expand at a sufficient rate and our planned expansion will require significant cash investment and management resources as well as efficiency in the execution of establishing these locations and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell and service our vehicles 

furthermore certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that may preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sales in such jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects and operating results see risk factor “ we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles” additionally we may face potential difficulties in finding suitable supercharger sites in desired locations negotiating leases or obtaining required permits for such locations 

we face risks associated with our international operations including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions and establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business 

we face various risks associated with our international operations we currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions in europe and asia that are subject to the legal political regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions additionally as part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sales maintenance repair and supercharger services internationally particularly in china however we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles internationally and such expansion requires us to make significant expenditures including the establishment of local operating entities hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 additionally as we have expanded into new international markets we have faced challenges with ensuring that our charging equipment works successfully with the charging infrastructure in such markets for example we have encountered such challenges in norway these types of issues could also arise as we enter into other new markets such as china if customers experience problems with the way our charging equipment works with the local charging infrastructure or we are unable to adapt our equipment to resolve such problems then the viability and acceptance of our vehicles in such markets could be materially and adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully address these risks our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 

foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar could harm our financial results 

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the japanese yen the euro the chinese yuan and the british pound if we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies especially against the japanese yen our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer as a result our operating results could be adversely affected as we dramatically increase model s deliveries overseas during 2014 and beyond as well as begin delivering powertrain units to daimler we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies in which case a strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advanced diesel ethanol fuel cells or compressed natural gas or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

the unavailability reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

any reduction elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the customer base of our electric vehicles fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular this could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative fuel vehicles generally and performance electric vehicles specifically for example we 

  

currently benefit from exemptions from california state sales and use taxes for purchases of up to 707 million of manufacturing equipment from our arrangements with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales and use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us through december 2016 this exemption is only available for equipment that would otherwise be subject to california sales and use taxes and that would be used only for specified purposes if we fail to meet these conditions we would be unable to take full advantage of this tax incentive and our financial position could be harmed 

in addition certain regulations and laws that encourage sales of electric cars through tax credits or other subsidies could be reduced eliminated or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect against our vehicles either currently or at any time in the future for example while the federal state and foreign governments have from time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel cars funding for these programs is limited and there is no guarantee that our vehicles will be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to alternative fuel vehicles in the future this would put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage as an example at the state level california renewed the clean vehicle rebate program a rebate program for the purchase of qualified alternative technology vehicles for 2013 such funds however may run out or be limited in ways that would be adverse to purchasers of our vehicles subsequent purchasers could face a delay in receiving rebates since they would have to wait until the next fiscal year’s funding became available or be unable to obtain a rebate at all moreover as more and more eligible evs are produced california will need to find additional sources of funding for this program or implement other options for removing eligibility for vehicles based on msrp or customer income levels these measures would almost certainly impact us in an adverse manner by making either our vehicles or customers ineligible for rebates as an additional example there is considerable discussion at the federal level over tax reform discussions have included reducing or even eliminating the current 7500 tax credit available to purchasers of qualified alternative fuel vehicles including model s 

also government programs have been enacted in europe favoring the purchase of electric vehicles including disincentives that discourage the use of gaspowered vehicles in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes taxes on nonrecurring vehicle fees or the 25 value added tax or other purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gaspowered vehicles in the event that such government programs are reduced or eliminated or the available benefits thereunder are exhausted earlier than anticipated sales of electric vehicles including our model s could be adversely affected 

our relationship with daimler is subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects 

our relationship with daimler poses various risks to us including potential loss of access to parts that daimler is providing for model s and potential loss of business and adverse publicity to our brand image if there are defects or other problems discovered with our electric powertrain components that daimler has incorporated into their vehicles the occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

the operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and our customers may experience difficulty operating them properly including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking 

we have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain in certain instances these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles for example we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle however when the vehicle is at maximum charge the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed by the vehicle accordingly our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking in addition we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the 

  

powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures in such instances the vehicle’s acceleration and speed will decrease finally if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains the vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected there can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly especially in these situations any accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation result in adverse publicity and product liability claims and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition if consumers dislike these features they may choose not to buy additional cars from us which could also harm our business and prospects 

if we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology we may suffer a decline in our competitive position 

we may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and as a result may suffer a decline in our competitive position any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology as technologies change we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology in particular battery cell technology however our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles for example we do not manufacture battery cells which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs 

if we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified management technical vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel our ability to compete could be harmed and our stock price may decline 

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results as well as cause our stock price to decline in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of directors and jb straubel our chief technical officer none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team as well as technical vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive experience in addition we do not have “key person” life insurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees 

currently in northern california there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineers manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain employees additionally we compete with many mature and prosperous companies in northern california that have far greater financial resources than we do and thus can offer current or perspective employees more lucrative incentive packages than we can any difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones would have an adverse effect on our performance 

  

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman of our board of directors and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and chairman of solarcity a solar equipment installation company 

we are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities 

as an automobile manufacturer we and our operations both in the united states and abroad are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business these laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs cleanup costs property damage bodily injury and fines and penalties capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations can be significant and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties third party damages suspension of production or a cessation of our operations 

contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by us as well as at properties we will own and operate and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations including but not limited to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla which can impose liability for the full amount of remediationrelated costs without regard to fault for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results we may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and negatively impact our ability to operate these facilities which would adversely impact our business prospects and operating results 

new united motor manufacturing inc nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at the tesla factory which could affect soil and groundwater and has undertaken efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues at the fremont site we cannot currently determine with certainty the total potential costs to remediate preexisting contamination and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of any environmental contamination at the fremont site 

as the owner of the fremont site we may be responsible under federal and state laws and regulations for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the fremont site whether it occurred before or after the date we purchased the property we have reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions remediation activities and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing 

  

on the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability including attorney fees or any costs or penalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental conditions and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement as of december 31 2013 we have accrued 55 million related to these environmental liabilities 

there are no assurances that nummi will perform its obligations under our agreement and nummi’s failure to perform would require us to undertake these obligations at a potentially significant cost and risk to our ability to increase the production capacity of and operate our tesla factory any remediation activities or other environmental conditions at the fremont site could harm our operations and the future use and value of the fremont site and could delay our production plans for model s 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities 

although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages our employees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory our automobile production facility in fremont california was purchased from nummi prior employees of nummi were union members and our future work force at this facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union we are also directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition the mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our reputation in the eyes of some investors and thereby negatively affect our stock price consequently the unionization of our labor force could negatively impact the company’s health 

we are subject to substantial regulation which is evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results 

our performance electric vehicles the sale of motor vehicles in general and the electronic components used in our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we have incurred and expect to incur in the future significant costs in complying with these regulations 

regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations such as in the united states 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 in addition as the automotive industry moves towards greater use of electronics for vehicle systems nhtsa and other regulatory bodies may in the future increase regulation for these electronic systems as concerns about distracted driving increase such concerns could affect electronic systems in model s including those used with the 17 inch display screen in model s which could reduce the appeal of model s or require adjustments to the display screen’s functionality 

as we are currently delivering vehicles in europe and as we begin to deliver vehicles in asia we also become subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to the import sale and service of automobiles in those regions with which we have little or no experience complying 

to the extent the laws change some or all of our vehicles may not comply with applicable international federal state or local laws which would have an adverse effect on our business compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome time consuming and expensive to the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 

we retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws 

we use our vehicles’ electronic systems to log information about each vehicle’s condition performance and use in order to aid us in providing customer service including vehicle diagnostics repair and maintenance as well as to help us collect data regarding our customers’ charge time battery usage mileage and efficiency habits and to improve our vehicles we also collect information about our customers through our website at our stores and facilities and via telephone our customers may object to the processing of this data which may negatively impact our ability to provide effective customer service and develop new vehicles and products collection and use of our customers’ personal information in conducting our business may be subject to federal andor state laws and regulations in the united states and foreign jurisdictions including in particular various jurisdictions in europe and such laws and regulations may restrict our processing of such personal information and hinder our ability to attract new customers or market to existing customers we may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy consumer protection and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations although we take steps to protect the security of our customers’ personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information a major breach of our network security and systems could 

  

have serious negative consequences for our businesses and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand 

we may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance 

any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we previously experienced product recalls in may 2009 october 2010 and june 2013 none of which was related to our electric powertrain in april 2009 we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider in october 2010 we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in june 2013 we initiated a recall of slightly more than one thousand model s vehicles to inspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in an upright position failure of this component may have resulted in collapse of the rear seat back during a crash finally in january 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain universal mobile connector nema 1450 adapters which are part of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves potentially overheating during charging in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our vehicles including model s or our electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards for example in november 2013 nhtsa initiated a preliminary evaluation with respect to two recent incidents in which model s vehicles collided with road debris at highway speeds although we believe that nhtsa should close the preliminary evaluation without a finding of defect it is possible that nhtsa could find that there is a defect and order model s to be recalled such recalls voluntary or involuntary involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected we provide a three year or 36000 mile new vehicle limited warranty with every tesla roadster which we extended to four years or 50000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 tesla roadster in addition customers have the opportunity to purchase extended service plans for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty for the tesla roadster to cover additional services for up to an additional three years or 36000 miles provided they are purchased within a specified period of time subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery we provide a four year or 50000 mile new vehicle limited warranty for the purchasers of model s the new vehicle limited warranty for model s covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125000 miles or unlimited miles depending on the size of the vehicle’s battery although the battery’s charging capacity is not covered under the new vehicle limited warranty or any extended service plan in addition customers have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty for model s to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50000 miles provided it is purchased within a specified period of time the new vehicle limited warranty and extended service plans for the tesla roadster and model s are subject to certain limitations exclusions or separate warranties including certain wear items such as tires brake pads paint and general appearance and battery performance and is intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems powertrain and brake system we have previously provided our tesla roadster customers with a battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles 

  

we record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs for new vehicles in particular we record warranty reserves based on management’s best estimate of projected warranty experience until adequate historical data is accumulated over a period of time generally a few quarters as we have limited operating experience with model s and therefore little experience with warranty claims for this vehicle reserves that we recorded for model s may be insufficient to cover all future warranty claims additionally in 2013 as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the customer ownership experience we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the new vehicle limited warranty in effect should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims we may need to record additional warranty reserves which would negatively affect our profitability 

since we began initiating sales of our vehicles we have continued to refine our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim experience and we may be required to undertake further changes in the future as of december 31 2013 we had warranty reserves of 532 million and such reserve amount will increase significantly in the future as our product offerings and sales grow we could in the future become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense there can be no assurances that our currently existing or future warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims due to potential higher average warranty expenses over the product life cycle or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction 

unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles’ systems may cause them to operate improperly or not at all or compromise their safety and data security which could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business 

there have been reports of vehicles of other automobile manufacturers being “hacked” to grant access and operation of the vehicles to unauthorized persons and wouldbe thieves our vehicles and in particular model s are technologically advanced machines requiring the interoperation of numerous complex and evolving hardware and software systems subject to our customers’ ability to opt out pursuant to our privacy policy model s is designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of these systems although we have designed implemented and tested security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our vehicles and their systems our information technology networks and communications with our vehicles may be vulnerable to interception manipulation damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors by personnel who have access to our networks and systems any such attacks or breaches could result in unexpected changes to our vehicles’ functionality user interface and performance characteristics hackers may also use similar means to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle such as its current geographical position previous and stored destination address history and web browser “favorites” any such unauthorized control of vehicles or access to or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and negative publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

the range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time and this may negatively influence potential customers’ decisions whether to purchase our vehicles 

the range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage time and charging patterns as well as other factors how a customer uses their tesla vehicle the frequency of recharging the battery pack at a low state of charge and the means of charging can result in additional deterioration of the battery pack’s ability to hold a charge over the long term for example we currently expect that our battery pack for the tesla roadster will retain approximately 70 of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100000 miles or seven years which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range and power deterioration of the model s battery pack is expected to be less than the roadster however such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and power over time as well as any perceived deterioration or fluctuation in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles 

  

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

we sell our vehicles from our tesla stores as well as over the internet we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the united states as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state in certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses we have worked with state regulators to open galleries which are locations where potential customers can view our vehicles but are not full retail locations it is possible that a state regulator could later determine that the activities at our gallery constitute unlicensed sales of motor vehicles 

in many states the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws and is being determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state how the sale transaction is structured the volume of sales into the state and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers as a result of the fact specific and largely untested nature of these issues and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators the manner in which the applicable authorities are applying their state laws to our distribution model continues to be difficult to predict laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so 

in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws for example in october 2012 vehicle dealer associations in new york and massachusetts filed lawsuits to revoke the dealer license issued to tesla motors new york in new york and to limit the business activity of tesla motors ma inc in massachusetts these lawsuits have been dismissed reinforcing our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model a similar litigation was recently filed in the state of ohio possible additional challenges in other states if successful could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states in some states there have also been legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model 

we are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in canada australia and japan and have obtained licenses to sell vehicles in other places such as hong kong and china furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time 

regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

we may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs 

companies organizations or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our vehicles or components which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such 

  

rights or otherwise assert their rights and seek licenses in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to do one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

 in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we may also face claims that our use of technology licensed or otherwise obtained from a third party infringes the rights of others in such cases we may seek indemnification from our licensorssuppliers under our contracts with them however indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses depending on our use of the technology whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation and other factors 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in weakening or loss of such rights which may allow our competitors to offer similar or identical products or use identical or confusingly similar branding potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage a decrease in our revenue and an attribution of potentially lower quality products to us which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results our success depends at least in part on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of patents patent applications trade secrets including knowhow employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright protection trademarks intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles 

the protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities however such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 existing trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the 

  

laws of the united states and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult unauthorized use or infringement of our trademarks in countries which have a “firsttofile” system could affect our ability to successfully grow our business internationally 

our patent applications may not result in issued patents which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours 

the status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of patented claims is uncertain we cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions nor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford sufficient protection against a competitor with similar technology in addition patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws rules and procedures that differ from those of the united states and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued us patents will result in issued patents in those foreign jurisdictions furthermore even if these patent applications do result in issued patents some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the united states in addition patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to outstanding opposition proceedings 

we currently sell and market our products and services in various countries under our tesla marks we have filed trademark applications for our tesla marks and opposition proceedings to trademark applications of third parties in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our products and services certain of our trademark applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants alleging prior use of similar marks if we cannot resolve these oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in these countries our ability to challenge third party users of the tesla marks will be reduced and the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these countries will be diluted in addition there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take actions to challenge our use of the tesla marks in these countries such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the tesla marks in these countries if we were prevented from using the tesla marks in any or all of these countries we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets 

our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events 

our corporate headquarters in palo alto and tesla factory in fremont are located in northern california a region known for seismic activity if major disasters such as earthquakes fires floods hurricanes wars terrorist attacks computer viruses pandemics or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products in addition our lease for our palo alto facility permits the landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain thresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts we may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

if our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity 

our core values which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity are an important component of our brand image which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to 

  

allegations of unethical business practices we do not control our independent suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices such as environmental responsibility fair wage practices appropriate sourcing of raw materials and compliance with child labor laws among others a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations 

violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand this could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if as a result of such violation we were to attract negative publicity if we or other manufacturers in our industry encounter similar problems in the future it could harm our brand image business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting we may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and as a result the value of our common stock 

we are required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting this assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

complying with section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources as a result of developing improving and expanding our core information technology systems as well as implementing new systems to support our sales engineering supply chain and manufacturing activities all of which require significant management time and support we may not be able to complete our internal control evaluation testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion additionally if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective for example our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of december 31 2012 because a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the presentation and disclosure of noncash capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

servicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

we incurred 6600 million in aggregate principal amount of senior indebtedness in may 2013 when we issued pursuant to registered public offerings 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 the notes our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on make payments upon conversion or to refinance the notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance the notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on the notes or future indebtedness 

  

pursuant to their terms holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding march 1 2018 only under certain circumstances for example holders may convert their notes at their option during any quarter commencing after the third quarter of 2013 and only during such quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price for such series of notes on each applicable trading day this condition was met in the third quarter of 2013 and consequently the notes were convertible by their holders during the fourth quarter of 2013 however the sales price condition was not met in the fourth quarter of 2013 and therefore the notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 but may be convertible in future periods should such sales price condition be met in any future quarter the notes will again be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter upon conversion of the notes we will be obligated to make cash payments in respect of the principal amounts thereof and we may also have to deliver cash and if applicable shares of our common stock in respect of such notes any conversion of the notes prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the notes or future indebtedness after any applicable notice or grace periods could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition even if holders do not elect to convert their notes if the notes become convertible we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material adverse impact on our reported financial results 

in addition holders of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted in addition our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to purchase notes at a time when the purchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof 

we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future we are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes or the indenture from incurring additional debt securing existing or future debt recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due 

the classification of our notes may have a material effect on our reported financial results 

holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding march 1 2018 only under certain circumstances for example holders may convert their notes at their option during any quarter commencing after the third quarter of 2013 and only during such quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price for the notes on each trading day this condition was met in the third quarter of 2013 and consequently the notes were convertible by their holders during the fourth quarter of 2013 however the sales price condition was not met in the fourth quarter of 2013 and therefore the notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 but may be convertible in future periods if the notes become convertible prior to march 1 2018 we would be required to reclassify our notes and the related debt issuance costs as current liabilities and certain portions of our equity outside of equity to 

  

mezzanine equity which would have an adverse impact on our reported financial results for such quarter and could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 

as of december 31 2013 our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 284 of our outstanding shares of common stock in particular elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owned approximately 270 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december 31 2013 as a result these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile 

our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on june 29 2010 and therefore the trading history for our common stock has been limited in addition the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 25920 per share and a low of 3380 per share over the last 52 weeks 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance these fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock during the period following a securities offering in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies for example a shareholder litigation like this has recently been instituted against us while we do not believe that it has merit this litigation or others like it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

a substantial portion of our total outstanding shares are held by a small number of insiders and investors and may be sold in the near future the large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock stockholders owning a substantial portion of our total outstanding shares are entitled under contracts providing for registration rights to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the united states subject to the restrictions of rule 144 in addition we have registered shares previously issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and agreements a portion of which are related to outstanding option awards subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and in certain cases lockup agreements the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the united states in the open market sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate these sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult to sell shares of our common stock 

  

conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their notes or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

the conversion of some or all of the notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the notes as described in the risk factor “ servicing our convertible senior notes requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt” the notes were convertible by their holders during the fourth quarter of 2013 and while they are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 they may again become convertible in future periods if a condition to conversion for the notes is met any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of notes may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties the convertible note hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlay the notes the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the notes we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock subject to customary antidilution adjustments however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates 

in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes this activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes 

we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or the shares of our common stock in addition we do not make any representation that the hedge counterparties have engaged or will engage in these transactions or that these transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice 

mr musk borrowed funds from affiliates of certain underwriters in our public offerings andor private placements in 2011 and 2013 and has pledged shares of our common stock to secure these borrowings the forced sale of these shares pursuant to a margin call could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business 

beginning in june 2011 goldman sachs bank usa an affiliate of goldman sachs  co has made extensions of credit in the aggregate amount of 275 million to elon musk and the elon musk revocable trust dated july 22 2003 or the trust a portion of which mr musk used to purchase shares of common stock in our public offering in may 2013 and private placements in june 2011 and june 2013 interest on the loan accrues at market rates goldman sachs bank usa received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans as a regulated entity goldman sachs bank usa makes decisions regarding making and managing its loans independent of goldman sachs  co mr musk and goldman have a longstanding relationship of almost a decade in addition morgan stanley smith barney llc an affiliate of morgan stanley  co llc has made a loan to mr musk in the aggregate amount of 25 million interest on this loan accrues at market rates morgan stanley smith barney llc received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with this loan 

  

we are not a party to these loans which are full recourse against mr musk and the trust and are secured by pledges of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk and the trust and other shares of capital stock of unrelated entities owned by mr musk and the trust the terms of these loans were negotiated directly between mr musk and goldman sachs bank usa and morgan stanley smith barney llc 

if the price of our common stock declines mr musk may be forced by goldman sachs bank usa andor morgan stanley smith barney llc to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans the loans between goldman sachs bank usa and morgan stanley smith barney llc on the one hand and mr musk and the trust on the other hand prohibit the nonpledged shares currently owned by mr musk and the trust from being pledged to secure any other loans these factors may limit mr musk’s ability to either pledge additional shares of tesla common stock or sell shares of tesla common stock as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged tesla common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common stock to decline further 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws the provisions of delaware law and the terms of our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt 

our certificate of incorporation bylaws delaware law and the terms of our notes contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

in addition the terms of the convertible notes require us to repurchase the convertible notes in the event of a fundamental change a takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the convertible notes to require us to repurchase the convertible notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the convertible notes 

  

the fundamental change repurchase feature of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 

the terms of the notes require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change a takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the notes 

if securities or industry analysts publishing research or reports about us our business or our market change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely or cease to publish research or reports about us our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us our business our market or our competitors if any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors our stock price would likely decline if any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 

we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future consequently investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend securities litigation 

in november 2013 a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against tesla in us district court northern district of california alleging violations of and seeking remedies pursuant to sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 10b5 the claims were originally asserted by plaintiff robert rahimi against tesla and two of its executive officers elon musk and deepak ahuja on february 14 2014 the court granted the motion of kazim acar to serve as lead plaintiff and gave him leave to file an amended complaint within 60 days the current complaint seeks damages attorney fees and other relief and alleges among other things that tesla made false andor misleading representations and omissions including with respect to the safety of the model s vehicle and tesla’s ability to meet public expectations with respect to its financial performance the current complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of “all persons other than defendants who purchased tesla’s securities between may 10 2013 and november 6 2013 inclusive” it is possible the amended complaint will modify the class or the class period we believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend against it vigorously

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview and 2013 highlights 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we are currently producing and selling our second vehicle the model s sedan model s is a four door fivepassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling the model s inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle the tesla roadster the tesla roadster was launched in 2008 and was the first commercially produced and federally compliant ev in the united states we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 and delivered 22477 vehicles in 2013 in february 2012 we revealed an early prototype of our model x crossover vehicle we currently expect to have production design model x prototypes on the road by the end of 2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015 

we sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network we are also building a network of superchargers in the united states europe and other international markets to allow model s owners to have the ability to travel long distances without a limitation on range by charging their cars at a very fast rate for free 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized total revenues of 201 billion an increase of 160 billion over total revenues of 4133 million for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily driven by the ramp up in model s deliveries which commenced in north america in june 2012 and the launch of european model s deliveries which commenced in august 2013 regulatory credit sales and powertrain component sales to toyota motor corporation toyota for the toyota rav4 ev partially offset by a decrease in development services activity related to the daimler ag daimler mercedesbenz bclass ev program 

gross margin for the year ended december 31 2013 was 227 a significant increase from 73 for the year ended december 31 2012 we experienced significant earlystage per unit cost inefficiencies during the production ramp of model s from june to december 2012 as a result of lower fixed cost absorption manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the initial production ramp and higher logistics costs as our supply chain processes were maturing we also had higher component prices as many vendors supplied parts at production prices later than planned due to their own manufacturing inefficiencies and production ramps as a result of higher vehicle production volume manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies and ongoing component cost reductions we achieved total and automotive gross margins of 255 and 257 respectively during the fourth quarter of 2013 regulatory credits sales higher average selling price due to the start of european signature series deliveries in august and a strong mix of 85 kwh battery packs and other options in all markets also contributed to higher gross margin in 2013 

research and development rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2320 million a decrease from 2740 million for the year ended december 31 2012 rd expenses in 2013 reflected our activities on manufacturing process improvements model s cost reductions the righthand drive model s and localization efforts for foreign markets as well as development work on model x rd expenses in 2012 included expenses related to our model s preproduction activities including manufacturing preparedness process validation prototype builds and extensive testing at both the vehicle and component levels development of the tesla factory development and testing of model s and other research and development activities until model s production started in the tesla factory in 2012 model s related manufacturing costs including labor costs manufacturing overhead and logistics were no longer captured in rd expenses but instead fully reflected in cost of automotive sales 

during 2013 we continued to expand our sales and service footprint both in north america and europe as well as opened our first store in china with the higher expenses associated with the global expansion of our 

  

customer infrastructure and the business in general including our information technology infrastructure selling general and administrative expenses were 2856 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 1504 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

we ended the year with 8489 million in cash and cash equivalents and current restricted cash a significant increase from cash held at the end of 2012 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 notes the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million we incurred 120 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes which we recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the notes under the terms of the notes 150 coupon interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 approximately 450 million of the offering proceeds were used to repay all of our outstanding department of energy doe loan principal and interest including a 108 million early repayment fee 

in connection with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to 53 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately 12452 per share the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was 1775 million in addition we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase up to approximately 53 million shares of our common stock at a price of 18448 per share we received 1203 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from 12452 to 18448 per share for more information on the notes convertible note hedge and warrant transactions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data 

concurrent with the execution of the notes and related transactions we also completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3902862 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately 3551 million which includes 487857 shares or 450 million sold to elon musk our chief executive officer and cofounder ceo net of underwriting discounts and offering costs we also sold 596272 shares of our common stock to our ceo and received total cash proceeds of 550 million in a private placement at the public offering price 

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans however if market conditions are favorable we may evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options 

management opportunities challenges and risks 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we made significant progress in increasing production aided by manufacturing design and quality improvements but also through strong efforts from our supply chain we expect production to increase from 600 vehicles per week presently to about 1000 vehicles per week by the end of 2014 as we expand our factory capacity and address supplier bottlenecks battery cell supply will continue to constrain our production during the first half of 2014 but should significantly improve in the second half of the year as our cell supplier brings new production capacity online based on our higher production level we currently expect to deliver over 35000 model s vehicles in 2014 representing a more than 55 increase over 2013 

in 2013 model s was the top selling vehicle in north america among comparably priced vehicles nonetheless we believe there is room to improve in 2014 as we complete the supercharger network and expand the network of service centers in north america given the potential we see in europe and asia we expect sales in those regions combined to comprise almost twice that of north america by the end of 2014 

  

through the first half of 2013 we had delivered model s vehicles solely to customers in north america in august 2013 we started european deliveries of model s similar to the initial launch of model s in the united states and in canada we experienced an increase in our average selling price during the third quarter of 2013 due to the start of delivery of european signature series vehicles and a higher mix of 85 kwh vehicles and other options in all markets 

we intend to commence deliveries into china in the spring of 2014 we recently announced that the price for a model s in china will be the same as the price for a model s in the united states with the addition of only unavoidable taxes customs duties and transportation costs while we believe that this is consistent with our objective of offering transparent and fair pricing in every market this pricing strategy is counter to prevailing auto industry practices as such model s in china would be priced comparable to a midsized premium vehicle in china instead of a large luxury vehicle 

expansion into the right hand drive markets such as the united kingdom japan hong kong and australia will occur gradually over the year starting this spring we have not delivered model s vehicles outside of north america and europe in volume thus we may face difficulties meeting our delivery plans in asia and other right hand drive markets later this year which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals 

in april 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners and in october 2013 we introduced this program in canada under the program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a predetermined resale value we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and accordingly we defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the guarantee program similarly we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales over the same period if a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term the amount of the resale value guarantee and operating lease vehicle net book value are then recognized in automotive sales and cost of automotive sales respectively 

the resale value guarantee amount represents management’s best estimate as to the resale value of the model s vehicle and related vehicle options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery we are depreciating our operating lease vehicles to expected salvage value of our operating lease vehicles at the end of their economic useful life ie the end of their expected operating lease term and we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed if the expected salvage value decreases in future periods as we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of model s we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates 

in 2013 we provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 5200 model s deliveries in north america during the fourth quarter of 2013 we provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 40 of model s deliveries in north america we expect the penetration rate of the resale value guarantee to remain at the current level in the nearterm model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery however this program has adversely impacted our 2013 revenues and operating results by requiring the amortization of revenues and costs under lease accounting and will continue to adversely impact our future revenues and operating results based on the lease accounting treatment applied to this program furthermore while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles’ resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our gross margin 

in germany and other european markets we recently announced new leasing and financing options in collaboration with a number of global financial partners if customer interest in these options is significant we may be directly or indirectly subject to resale value risks for the model s we are currently evaluating a number of other customer financing products including direct small business leases as a way to better serve our growing customer base 

  

in addition to sales of model s we continue to recognize automotive sales from our supply of powertrain systems to toyota for the toyota rav4 ev however toyota is expected to end the current rav4 ev model this year 

in 2012 we began work on a full electric powertrain under the mercedesbenz bclass ev program and in 2013 we continued to provide development services and deliver prototype samples to daimler we currently expect to substantially complete our development services under this program in early 2014 and commence production of electric powertrains and battery packs shortly thereafter similar to our previous development services agreements due to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of milestone revenues and the underlying costs of development services the gross margin from our development services activities may vary from period to period 

we also plan to ramp up sales of stationary energy storage units for use in homes commercial sites and utilities the applications for these battery systems include backup power peak demand reduction demand response and wholesale electric market services however we have not yet entered into a significant number of agreements through december 31 2013 

significant production cost improvements for model s were achieved in 2013 including part cost reductions as well as manufacturing efficiencies we expect some of these trends to continue as we execute on our roadmap of achieving further component cost reductions and benefit from economies of scale we therefore expect our automotive gross margin to increase to about 28 in the fourth quarter of 2014 excluding potential zero emission vehicle zev credit sales and assuming a lower option take rate as we get to a more mainstream market and fewer people take the high performance options on model s if we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected 

in october 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with panasonic corporation panasonic to among other things extend the term of the agreement by two years until december 31 2017 and provide for the longterm preferential prices and a minimum of 18 billion lithiumion battery cells that we will purchase from panasonic from 2014 through 2017 

we recognized 1298 million in zev credit sales in 2013 which contributed to our gross margin although zev credit revenue was strong for the year over 90 of zev credit sales were recognized during the first half of 2013 we expect the contribution of zev credit revenue to remain low in the future relative to our automotive sales as we continue to grow our sales outside the united states while we will pursue opportunities to monetize zev credits we earn from the sales of our vehicles we do not plan to rely on these sales to be a contributor to gross margin our business model and financial plan is not predicated on such zev credits other regulatory credit sales recognized during 2013 were 647 million 

in february 2012 we revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform we continue to work on the design and engineering work on model x and expect to have production design model x prototypes on the road by the end of 2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015 our ability to launch the model x program on time and cost efficiently is dependent upon a variety of factors including supplier readiness engineering completion and testing 

we continued to expand our stores and service infrastructure during 2013 in order to expand our geographical presence and to provide better service in areas with a high concentration of model s customers to help drive demand in new geographic areas we have also begun complementing our store strategy with sales capability within service centers to more rapidly and efficiently expand our retail footprint as of the end of the year we had stores galleries and service centers in over 110 locations around the world and plan to open many additional stores galleries and service centers in 2014 including growing rapidly in multiple regions in china we continue to build service infrastructure in advance of demand to ensure that aftersale services are available when and where needed and to help create further demand 

  

at the end of may 2013 we announced the significant expansion of our supercharger network as well as plans to reduce charging time at our superchargers since the time of our announcement we have been installing superchargers at an accelerating pace as of february 19 2014 we had 90 supercharger stations open and are continuing to expand our network in both north america and europe during 2014 we also intend to establish a supercharger network in china japan and hong kong if we experience difficulties in finding suitable sites negotiating leases or obtaining required permits for such locations our planned expansion of such superchargers could be delayed 

operating expense and capital expenditures are expected to significantly increase in absolute terms in 2014 as we plan to invest in the longterm growth of the company in 2014 we plan to significantly expand production capacity for model s and model x invest in our customer support infrastructure complete the development of model x and start early design work on our third generation vehicle which we refer to as “gen iii” our research and development expenses in particular are expected to increase as design and engineering work accelerates on model x our selling general and administrative expenses will continue to grow in absolute terms as we expand our customer and corporate infrastructure globally 

we have recently indicated our intention to build the tesla gigafactory a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material cell module and battery pack production in one location while we have not identified a final site for this facility we currently expect that it will be located in one of the following states arizona nevada new mexico or texas we currently expect the facility to be built on a lot between 500 and 1000 acres in size with up to approximately 10 million square feet of production space with one or two levels at full implementation the tesla gigafactory is expected to have 6500 dedicated tesla and production partner employees we currently plan to commence supplying battery packs manufactured at the tesla gigafactory for our vehicles including the gen iii vehicle and stationary storage applications in approximately three years the tesla gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020 which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500000 vehicles annually and stationary storage applications 

we believe that the tesla gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30 on a per kwh basis by the end of the first year of volume production of gen iii the total capital expenditures associated with the tesla gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be 45 billion of which approximately 2 billion is expected to come from tesla 

while our plan is to attempt to produce lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for our gen iii vehicles at a new tesla gigafactory our plans for such production are at a very early stage we have no experience in the production of lithiumion cells and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production and to date we have not formalized such partnerships in addition the cost of building and operating the tesla gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the tesla gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate 

during the third quarter of 2013 certain conditions with respect to the closing prices of our common stock in accordance with the terms of our notes were met and accordingly the notes were convertible at the holder’s option during the fourth quarter of 2013 although these conditions were not met during the fourth quarter of 2013 and therefore the notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 should such closing price conditions be met in a future quarter the notes will be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter upon conversion of the notes we will be obligated to pay cash for the principal amount of the converted notes and we may also have to deliver shares of our common stock in respect of such converted notes any conversion of the notes prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the notes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows business results of operations and financial condition 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

automotive sales 

we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of model s including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits such as zev and greenhouse gas emission ghg credits we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems such as battery packs and drive units to other manufacturers we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

model s revenue is generally recognized when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers in certain circumstances we may deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered by the customer if the options do not limit the functionality of the vehicle in such cases we will continue to defer the related revenue based on the undelivered item’s fair value as evidenced by the contractual price of the option in standalone transactions where available or using the selling price hierarchy where such prices do not exist additionally if a customer purchases a vehicle option that requires us to provide services in the future we will defer the related revenue based on the undelivered items’ fair value and recognize the associated revenue over our expected performance period while these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale they are often part of a single vehicle sales agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements 

for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available to date we have generally been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles vehicle accessories and options separately outside of any multiple element arrangements to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue we consider whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we also evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a standalone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items further we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items determined by reference to standalone sales of such items as each of these items has standalone value to the customer revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer 

  

resale value guarantee 

in april 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners and in october 2013 we introduced this program in canada under the program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a predetermined resale value although we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases accordingly we defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the guarantee program ie the proxy operating lease term similarly we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales over the same period if a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term the amount of the resale value guarantee and operating lease vehicle net book value is then recognized in automotive sales and cost of automotive sales respectively 

we estimated the expected residual value based on an evaluation of market indicators competitive factors as well as a third party valuation study we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed if the expected salvage value is projected to be lower in future periods as we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of model s we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates 

regulatory credit sales 

california and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles these laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements similar regulations exist at the federal level which require compliance related to ghg emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers as a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles we have earned regulatory credits such as zev and ghg credits on vehicles and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future since our commercial vehicles are electric we do not receive any compliance benefit from the generation of these credits and accordingly look to sell them to other vehicle manufacturers in order to facilitate the sale of these credits we enter into contractual agreements with third parties requiring them to purchase our regulatory credits at predetermined prices we recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal title to the credits are transferred to the purchasing party by the governmental agency issuing these credits 

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for model s which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery with either a fixed fee per visit for tesla ranger service or unlimited tesla ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations 

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of model s parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time for customers that are not covered by our new vehicle limited warranties or our extended service plans we offer tesla ranger service at a higher cost payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods 

  

we provided tesla roadster customers with the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36000 miles we refer to this program as our extended service plan amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales over the extended warranty period 

additionally we have previously provided customers of our tesla roadsters with a onetime option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles we refer to this program as our battery replacement program amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the battery packs 

development services 

revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from the development of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other automobile manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs drive units and sample vehicles to meet a customer’s specifications revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured where development arrangements include substantive atrisk milestones revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractuallydefined milestones amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet increased complexity to our development agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

costs of development services are expensed as incurred costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses once an agreement is finalized these costs are recorded in cost of development services

we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 

once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand selling prices and production costs should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change material changes to these reserves may be required further a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we accrue warranty reserves at the time revenue is recognized for the sale of a vehicle or powertrain component warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace 

  

any items under warranty based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations and we will adjust our estimates as needed initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly the adjustments that we record may be material 

it is likely that as we sell additional vehicles and powertrain components and as we repair or replace items under warranty we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to service work under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments further a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

valuation of stockbased awards and warrants 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan espp which require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of stock options and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures 

the fair value of stock options and the espp were estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the following assumptions 

 

 if in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stockbased awards is more reasonable or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for our stockbased awards could change significantly 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

  

the riskfree interest rate that we use is based on the united states treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life given our limited history with employee grants we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants the “simplified” method as permitted by the sec is calculated as the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the options 

our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility and the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business including the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries because we have limited trading history on our common stock when making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation we also considered the stage of development size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies our historical volatility and implied volatility are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

in august 2012 our board of directors granted 5274901 stock options to our ceo 2012 ceo grant the 2012 ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date 

each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten predetermined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 40 billion as compared to the initial market capitalization of 32 billion measured at the time of the 2012 ceo grant 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the term of the 2012 ceo grant is ten years so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested options will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise based on our current market valuation and operating plans we believe that up to the first three tranches of the 2012 ceo grant all relating to model x will vest during 2014 

we measured the fair value of the 2012 ceo grant using a monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions riskfree interest rate of 165 expected term of ten years expected volatility of 55 and dividend yield of 0 

stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2012 ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met 

as of december 31 2013 the market conditions for three vesting tranches were achieved and the following three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement 

 

  

  

 none of the stock options granted under the 2012 ceo grant has vested as the performance milestones have not yet been achieved as of december 31 2013  however as the above three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 145 million and 13 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

additionally no cash compensation has been received by our ceo for his services to the company 

income taxes 

we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans as of december 31 2013 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 

  

which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods presented in thousands except per share data 

 

 revenues 

automotive sales 

automotive sales which include vehicle options and related sales and powertrain component and related sales consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

 

   

automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2013 were 20 billion an increase from 3857 million for the year ended december 31 2012 vehicle options and related sales primarily represent revenues related to deliveries of model s including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers powertrain component and related sales represent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems such as battery packs and drive units to other manufacturers 

vehicle options and related sales during the year ended december 31 2013 were 195 billion an increase from 3543 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the significant increase in vehicle options and related sales was primarily driven by the delivery of 22477 model s vehicles for the year including the commencement of european deliveries in august 2013 for the year ended december 31 2012 we had delivered about 2650 model s vehicles following the commencement of our model s deliveries in june 2012 the increase also resulted from higher sales of regulatory credits including 1298 million in zev credit sales for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 324 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

in april 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners and in october 2013 we introduced this program in canada under the program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months for a predetermined resale value we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and accordingly we defer and amortize to revenues the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the guarantee program if a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term the amount of the resale value guarantee is then recognized in automotive sales through december 31 2013 we delivered approximately 5200 model s vehicles under the resale value guarantee program as of december 31 2013 we recorded 2309 million in deferred revenues and 2363 million in resale value guarantee related to model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized revenue of 291 million in automotive sales related to this program 

powertrain component and related sales for the periods presented were related to powertrain component sales to toyota under the rav4 ev supply and services agreement which commenced in march 2012 powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2013 were 451 million an increase from 341 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2012 were 3857 million an increase from 1486 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2012 were 3543 million an increase from 1017 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in vehicle options and related sales was primarily attributable to the commencement of model s customer deliveries in june 2012 and subsequent ramp as well as sales of regulatory credits partially offset by a decrease in the number of tesla roadsters sold as we completed production of the tesla roadster in january 2012 and were selling our remaining inventory primarily in europe and asia 

vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2012 included regulatory credit sales of 405 million compared to regulatory credit sales of 27 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the significant increase in production and delivery of vehicles in the united states allowed us to sell more regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers 

powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2012 were 314 million a decrease from 469 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in powertrain component and related sales was primarily due to fewer shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler production for both 

  

the daimler smart fortwo and aclass ev programs was substantially completed as of december 31 2011 during the three months ended march 31 2012 we began supplying powertrain systems to toyota under the rav4 ev supply and services agreement and recognized 291 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

development services 

development services represent arrangements where we develop electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other automotive manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs drive units and chargers to meet customers’ specifications 

development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was 157 million a decrease from 276 million for the year ended december 31 2012 development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was 276 million a decrease from 557 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 daimler engaged us to assist with the development of a full electric powertrain for a daimler mercedesbenz bclass ev vehicle in 2012 we received two purchase orders from daimler to begin development work and also entered into a separate development agreement under which we would complete various milestones and deliver prototype samples during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we recognized a total 157 million and 159 million in development services revenue respectively related to this program 

in july 2010 we entered into an agreement with toyota to initiate development of an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 under this phase 0 development agreement prototypes were made by us by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery pack power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which would be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 during the year ended december 31 2011 we completed various milestones and delivered several samples under the phase 1 agreement and delivered all development services under the phase 0 agreement during the three months ended march 31 2012 we completed our remaining milestones and delivered samples under the phase 1 agreement development services revenue under these arrangements with toyota for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was 107 million and 550 million respectively 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services 

cost of automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2013 was 154 billion an increase from 3717 million for the year ended december 31 2012 cost of automotive sales includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs royalty fees shipping and logistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand the increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by model s deliveries including the commencement of european deliveries in august 2013 as well as deliveries of electric powertrain component and systems to toyota under the toyota rav4 ev supply and services agreement 

in april 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and financed their vehicle and vehicle options through one of our specified commercial banking partners and in october 2013 we introduced this program in canada under the program we capitalize the cost of model s into operating lease vehicles and depreciate the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the guarantee 

  

program if a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term the remaining operating lease vehicle net book value is then recognized in automotive sales as of december 31 2013 we recorded 3770 million in operating lease vehicles net related to model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 194 million in cost of automotive sales related to vehicle depreciation under this program our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our resale value guarantee vehicles as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred for the year ended december 31 2013 warranty costs incurred for our resale value guarantee vehicles were 16 million 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2013 was 4563 million an increase from 301 million for the year ended december 31 2012 this increase was driven primarily by model s deliveries which began in june 2012 in north america and in august 2013 in europe and the sales of regulatory credits which carry no associated cost of revenues the increase was also attributable to our continuing cost reduction efforts including process efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain design improvements as well as reduction of waste in the supply chain 

cost of automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2012 was 3717 million an increase from 1155 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by the commencement of model s deliveries in june 2012 as well as electric powertrain component and systems sales to toyota as we began to deliver under the toyota rav4 ev supply and services agreement partially offset by a decrease in the number of tesla roadster deliveries and battery packs and chargers delivered to daimler 

cost of development services for the year ended december 31 2012 was 115 million a decrease from 272 million for the year ended december 31 2011 cost of development services includes engineering support and testing direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements the decrease in cost of development services was driven primarily by our activities for the toyota rav4 ev program which we substantially completed during the three months ended march 31 2012 partially offset by costs associated with development activities related to the mercedesbenz bclass ev program which we commenced in 2012 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2012 was 301 million a decrease from 616 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 was driven primarily by the commencement of model s deliveries and the associated early stage cost inefficiencies including lower fixed cost absorption manufacturing inefficiencies related to production ramp higher initial parts costs and higher logistics costs as our supply chain took time to mature as well as lower sales of the tesla roadster partially offset by the sales of regulatory credits which carry no associated cost of revenues 

we expect our development services gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate in future periods as the timing of revenue recognition may not coincide with the period in which the corresponding cost of revenues is recognized 

research and development expenses 

research and development rd expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense overhead costs related to the tesla factory prior to the start of production of model s are also included in rd expenses also included in rd expenses are development services costs that we incur if any prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is 

  

not assured development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2320 million a decrease from 2740 million for the year ended december 31 2012 rd expenses decreased due to significant development prototyping and testing expenses related to the model s launch in 2012 partially offset by an increase in similar costs in 2013 for model x and righthand drive model s and other programs the 420 million decrease in rd expenses during the year ended december 31 2013 consisted primarily of an 182 million decrease in expensed materials an 85 million decrease in employee compensation expenses a 78 million decrease in costs related to model s engineering design and testing activities a 66 million decrease in shipping charges for model s prototype materials and a 49 million decrease in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs the decrease was partially offset by a 50 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants 

research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 were 2740 million an increase from 2090 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 650 million increase in research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2012 consisted primarily of a 543 million increase in employee compensation expenses from higher headcount a 231 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business a 151 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants and a 33 million increase in shipping charges for prototype materials incurred in the first half of 2012 the increase was partially offset by a 309 million decrease in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s beta and release candidate builds as well as powertrain development activities 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 

sga expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2856 million an increase from 1504 million for the year ended december 31 2012 sga expenses increased primarily from higher headcount and costs to support an expanded retail service and supercharger footprint as well as the general growth of the business the 1352 million increase in our sga expenses during the year ended december 31 2013 consisted primarily of a 628 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 368 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence a 178 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants and a 172 million increase in professional and outside services costs 

sga expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 were 1504 million an increase from 1041 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 463 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2012 consisted primarily of a 243 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 94 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support an expanded store and service network and the growth of our business in general a 60 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and 

  

generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants and a 60 million increase in professional and outside services costs 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was 364 million an increase from 79 million for the year ended december 31 2012 historically we incurred interest expense primarily from our loans under the doe loan facility and capitalized interest to assets under construction related to significant asset construction for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we capitalized 35 million and 76 million of interest expense to construction in progress respectively 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of notes the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million we incurred 120 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes which we have recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the notes under the terms of the notes 150 coupon interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 12 million of interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and 59 million of coupon interest expense 

in accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of 828 million in equity the resulting debt discount on the notes is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 429 over the contractual term of the notes for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 91 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount 

in may 2013 we used a portion of the notes offering proceeds to repay our outstanding department of energy doe loan principal of 4396 million a 108 million early repayment fee and accrued interest of 14 million as a result of the extinguishment of our loans unamortized loan origination costs associated with the doe loan facility of 56 million were charged to interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded total interest expense of 178 million related to the early repayment fee accrued interest and the amortization of the remaining loan origination costs on the doe loan facility 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was 79 million and 51 million respectively incurred primarily from our loans under the doe loan facility to fund our model s and powertrain activities and as of august 2012 we had fully drawn down on the doe loan facility during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we capitalized 76 million and 51 million of interest expense to construction in progress respectively 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates prior to the expiration of the doe warrant in may 2013 the doe warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income expense net 

other income net for the year ended december 31 2013 was 226 million an increase in income compared to other expense net of 18 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in other income net was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability of 107 million for the year ended december 31 2013 in march 2013 we entered into a fourth amendment to the doe loan facility which among other things accelerated the maturity date of our doe loans to december 15 2017 

  

therefore the doe warrant was no longer expected to vest the increase in other income net was also attributable to the favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currencydenominated liabilities during the year ended december 31 2013 especially related to the japanese yen 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2012 was 18 million a decrease in expense compared to other expense net of 26 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily due to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currencydenominated liabilities partially offset by the fair value change in our common stock warrant liability during the year ended december 31 2012 resulting from a higher stock price 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2013 was 26 million compared to 01 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase for the year ended december 31 2013 was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we commenced european deliveries of model s in august 2013 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012 was 01 million a decrease from 05 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease was due primarily to the decrease in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we concluded sales of the tesla roadster 

liquidity and capital resources 

since inception and through the year ended december 31 2013 we had accumulated net operating losses of 114 billion and have used 4667 million of cash in operations as of december 31 2013 we had 8459 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including 4603 million of money market funds 

other sources of cash include cash from our deliveries of model s customer deposits for model s and model x sales of regulatory credits cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems in the short term we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans these capital sources will enable us to fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects including those for our planned model x crossover and certain future products establish and expand our stores service centers and supercharger network and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model x and to continue to ramp up production of model s we may seek additional capital sources to partially fund certain longterm growth initiatives such as to build the tesla gigafactory and for future products such as our third generation vehicle 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we increased the number of superchargers to nearly 90 locations in north america and in europe we expect to continue making investments in the supercharger network in 2014 including in china 

if market conditions are favorable we will continually evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options also should prevailing economic conditions andor financial business or other factors adversely affect the estimates of our future cash requirements we could be required to fund our cash requirements through additional or alternative sources of financing we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between 650 million and 850 million during the year ending december 31 2014 

  

150 convertible senior notes and bond hedge and warrant transactions 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 the notes in a public offering the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million we incurred 120 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes which we have recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the notes the interest under the notes is fixed at 150 per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 

each 1000 of principal of the notes will initially be convertible into 80306 shares of our common stock which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 12452 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option on or after march 1 2018 further holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option prior to march 1 2018 only under the following circumstances 1 during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ending september 30 2013 if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day 2 during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes is less than 98 of the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for each day during such five trading day period or 3 if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur upon conversion we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount of the note and if applicable shares of our common stock subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock based on a calculated daily conversion value if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest in addition if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances 

in connection with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to 53 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately 12452 per share the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was 1775 million in addition we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase up to approximately 53 million shares of our common stock at a price of 18448 per share we received 1203 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from 12452 to 18448 per share 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130 of the applicable conversion price of our notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter furthermore no other conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert have been met as of december 31 2013 therefore the notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 and are classified as longterm debt should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2014 or a future quarter the notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter 

for more information on the notes see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

common stock offering and concurrent private placement 

concurrent with the execution of the notes and related transactions in may 2013 we also completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3902862 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately 3551 million which includes 487857 shares or 450 million sold to our chief 

  

executive officer ceo net of underwriting discounts and offering costs we also sold 596272 shares of our common stock to our ceo and received total cash proceeds of 550 million in a private placement at the public offering price 

customer deposits 

customer deposits consist of payments that allow potential customers to place an order for the future purchase of a model s or model x these amounts are recorded as current liabilities until the vehicle is delivered we require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer amounts received by us as customer deposits are generally not restricted as to their use by us upon delivery of the vehicle the related customer deposits are applied against the customer’s total purchase price for the vehicle and recognized in automotive sales as part of the respective vehicle sale 

historically we have referred to such customer deposits as reservation payments and these initial reservation payments have been fully refundable until such time that the customer selected the vehicle specifications and entered into a purchase agreement we have eliminated the reservation process for model s in north america and in most of our markets in europe as vehicle production became more reliable and customer wait times decreased customers now initiate their purchase by ordering their customized model s rather than placing a generic reservation in queue as a result of this transition away from reservations we have renamed the “reservation payments” caption on our consolidated financial statements to “customer deposits” customer deposits related to model x still represent fully refundable reservations as of december 31 2013 we held customer deposits of 1632 million

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of december 31 2013 certain significant cash obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands 

 

   

in october 2010 we completed the purchase of our tesla factory located in fremont california from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at the fremont site which could affect soil and groundwater and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues we cannot determine with certainty the potential costs to remediate any preexisting contamination based on management’s best estimate we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be 53 million as nummi continues with its decommissioning activities and as we continue with our construction and operating activities it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially 

we reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing through december 31 2013 remediation costs of 21 million had been incurred by nummi therefore we classified 21 million of 55 million environmental liabilities to accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we accrued a total of 55 million and 53 million related to these environmental liabilities respectively 

on the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on the remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency risk 

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 to customers in north america and to european customers in august 2013 through december 31 2013 a majority of our revenues have been denominated in us dollars with a growing exposure to euro and norwegian krona however a portion of our costs and expenses during the year ended december 31 2013 was denominated in foreign currencies including the japanese yen euro and british pound accordingly if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against currencies where we have a net short exposure our costs as measured in us dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase which may adversely impact our operating results we plan to start asian deliveries in 2014 as we continue to launch model s overseas we may have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies in which case a strengthening of the dollar against such currencies would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars 

as a result of a favorable foreign currency exchange impact from foreign currencydenominated liabilities especially related to the japanese yen we recorded gains of 119 million on foreign exchange transactions in other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2013 

  

interest rate risk 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 8459 million as of december 31 2013 a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2013 we had 6600 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding and capital lease obligations of 206 million all of which are fixed rate instruments therefore our results of operations are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in “internal control—integrated framework 1992” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2013 

our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 as stated in their report which is included herein 

remediation of previously reported material weakness 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis for the year ended december 31 2012 it was concluded that a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the presentation and disclosure of noncash capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows specifically we did not design effective controls to determine and review the total unpaid amounts related to capital expenditures that should have been excluded from operating and investing activities in the cash flow statement and disclosed as noncash items 

this material weakness resulted in an audit adjustment related to noncash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2012 a restatement of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended march 31 2012 june 30 2012 and september 30 2012 including their comparative periods for 2011 and a revision of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 

  

in response to the material weakness described above our financial reporting review process now includes a determination and review of i total unpaid amounts related to capital expenditures that should be excluded from operating and investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows and ii the total unpaid amounts related to capital expenditures that should be disclosed as noncash items in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

based on the measures taken and implemented management has tested the newly implemented control activities and found them to be effective and has concluded that the material weakness described above has been remediated as of december 31 2013 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

because of inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended december 31 2013 which has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business tableend we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies we believe our vehicles electric vehicle engineering expertise and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers 

we are the first company to commercially produce a federallycompliant electric vehicle the tesla roadster which achieves a marketleading range on a single charge combined with attractive design driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions our tesla roadster offers impressive acceleration and performance without producing any tailpipe emissions the tesla roadster’s proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business and with design enhancements will also form the basis for our model s sedan our model x crossover as well as future vehicles 

model s is in an advanced stage of development and is currently scheduled to commence customer deliveries by july 2012 we expect that model s will be manufactured with an adaptable platform architecture upon which other future vehicles including our model x crossover will be based we revealed a prototype of the model x crossover in february 2012 we plan to start model x production in late 2013 and ramp up to significant customer deliveries in early 2014 this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as a dual motor allwheel drive system 

in addition to developing our own vehicles we provide services for the development of electric powertrain components and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers we have provided development services and powertrain components to daimler ag daimler for its smart fortwo and aclass electric vehicles we recently announced the receipt of an initial purchase order for the development of a full powertrain system for an additional mercedes benz vehicle from daimler we also have almost completed a development services program to produce a full electric powertrain system for toyota motor corporation toyota for use in its rav4 ev we anticipate beginning to ship these systems to toyota during the first half of 2012 under our supply and services agreement 

the commercial production of a highway capable fully electric vehicle that meets consumers’ range and performance expectations requires substantial design engineering and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles our roots in silicon valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering power electronics and software engineering we have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration we believe these capabilities coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong inhouse engineering and manufacturing capacity will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the tesla roadster 

we sell and service our tesla roadster though our companyowned sales and service network in the north america europe and asia our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while gathering rapid customer feedback and achieving operating efficiencies better control over the costs of inventory warranty service pricing and the development of the tesla brand our tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and as a result do not require corresponding large floor spaces we believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership combined with our product design based on modularity and common platforms will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business we believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers 

  

our first vehicle the tesla roadster can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 39 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour the roadster sport version can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 37 seconds the tesla roadster has a range of 245 miles on a single charge as determined using the united states environmental protection agency’s epa’s combined twocycle cityhighway test the tesla roadster has a range that is almost double that of any other commercially released electric vehicle and reportedly set a new world distance record of 313 miles on a single charge for a production electric car in a rally across australia as part of the 2009 global green challenge as of december 31 2011 we had delivered approximately 2150 tesla roadsters to customers in over 31 countries almost all of which were sold in north america and europe we concluded the production run of the tesla roadster in january 2012 we are selling our remaining tesla roadsters primarily in europe and asia during 2012 until our inventory is depleted to date our customers have driven the tesla roadster for an estimated aggregate of almost 20 million miles 

we announced our second electric vehicle model s with the public exhibition of a drivable early prototype in march 2009 in october 2011 we invited over three thousand customers and other stakeholders to see and ride in the beta prototypes of model s at our manufacturing facility in fremont california the tesla factory we have completed the construction of several drivable model s alpha and beta prototypes which are currently undergoing detailed testing we currently plan to begin customer deliveries of model s by july 2012 

model s is a four door fivepassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling as a fully electric vehicle model s will produce zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of as low as 44 seconds in its performance version the base model s will have an effective base price of 49900 in the united states with the 40 kilowatthour kwh battery pack option assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles even without the tax credit we believe the base list price will be competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles we believe that model s will demonstrate our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer longrange capabilities and uncompromised performance energy efficiency convenience and design 

we plan to offer model s with a variety of battery pack options—40 kwh 60 kwh and 85 kwh—which we estimate will offer a range on a single charge of 160 miles 230 miles and 300 miles respectively while traveling at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour the epa’s new fuel economy requirements will require us to label model s utilizing new and different energy efficiency testing methodologies these methodologies differ from the one we have used to estimate the range of the vehicles at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour and could reduce the range reported on the required labeling of our vehicles by up to 30 as compared to our current estimates 

we are designing model s for a significantly broader customer base than the tesla roadster accordingly we currently intend to target an annual production rate of approximately 20000 cars per year beginning in 2013 from our tesla factory we currently plan to commence deliveries by july 2012 and to deliver approximately 5000 model s sedans in 2012 as of december 31 2011 we had received over 8000 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of 5000 

we have nearly completed the tesla factory our integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in fremont california for the manufacture of model s and its components in october 2010 we completed the purchase of this facility from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi we intend to use the facility for the production of our model s vehicle model x crossover and to build our future electric vehicles we have entered into a loan agreement with the united states federal financing bank and united states department of energy doe loan facility to arrange loans for up to 4650 million 3639 million of which is intended for the continued development of model s and the build out of the tesla factory 

the electric powertrain we developed for the tesla roadster has provided the foundational technology for our model s our model x crossover and our future vehicles and for electric powertrain components and systems 

  

that we are selling to daimler and its affiliates and that we intend to sell to toyota our electric powertrain consists of the following components our modular battery pack our power electronics gearbox our motor and control and integration software which enables the components to operate as a system we sell certain of these components to daimler and intend to sell these systems to toyota and have secured 1012 million of an aggregate 4650 million from our doe loan facility to fund the infrastructure for these powertrain activities we believe that our efforts in our powertrain development will enable us to advance our technology and rapidly and cost effectively develop vehicles 

our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver marketleading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatthour the battery pack of the tesla roadster uses commercially available lithiumion battery cells and contains 53 kilowatthours of usable energy almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack thereby significantly increasing its range capability designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs motors powertrain systems and vehicle engineering our proprietary technology includes cooling systems safety systems charge balancing systems battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding reallife driving conditions these technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio—as of december 31 2011 we had 59 issued patents and more than 230 pending patent applications with the united states patent and trademark office and internationally in a broad range of areas 

we are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles for example we are designing a common platform architecture for model s which compactly positions the battery pack motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle we believe this architecture will form the basis of several future vehicles including our planned model x crossover and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future 

our design and vehicle engineering capabilities combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design styling and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles as a result we believe our tesla roadster customers enjoy and model s customers will enjoy several benefits including 

 

  

   

 our vehicles and products 

we currently design manufacture and sell fully electric vehicles and electric powertrain components 

the tesla roadster 

our first vehicle the tesla roadster is the first highperformance electric sports car the twoseat convertible tesla roadster has a combination of range style performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today it can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 39 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour the tesla roadster also has a range of 245 miles on a single charge as determined using the united states epa’s combined twocycle cityhighway test this range is almost double that of any other commercially released electric vehicle 

as of december 31 2011 we had delivered approximately 2150 tesla roadsters to customers in over 31 countries almost all of which were sold to customers in north america and europe the tesla roadster complies with or is exempt from all applicable vehicle safety standards in the united states the european union as well as select other countries to date our customers have driven the tesla roadster for an estimated aggregate of almost 20 million miles we concluded the production run of the tesla roadster in january 2012 we are selling our remaining tesla roadsters primarily in europe and asia during 2012 until our inventory is depleted 

the cumulative capital expenditures and research and development costs for the tesla roadster from our inception to the date we delivered our first tesla roadster was approximately 125 million 

we have continued to rapidly develop the tesla roadster since its introduction in june 2009 nine months after its commercial introduction we launched the tesla roadster 2 as well as a highperformance variant the tesla roadster sport we delivered our first righthand drive model of the tesla roadster in january 2010 and have since delivered righthand drive roadsters into key markets such as the united kingdom japan hong kong and australia in july 2010 we released the roadster 25 an upgraded version of roadster 2 

model s 

our second vehicle model s is currently expected to begin customer deliveries by july of 2012 and we currently plan to deliver approximately 5000 model s sedans in 2012 we are leveraging technologies within the electric powertrain of the tesla roadster to create a fourdoor fiveadultpassenger sedan that produces zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of as low as 44 seconds in its performance version model s acceleration from zero to 60 miles per hour is targeted at 65 seconds 59 seconds and 56 seconds for the 40 kwh 60 kwh and 85 kwh battery pack options respectively we have designed model s to include a third row with two rearfacing child seats subject to applicable safety regulations and requirements allowing us to offer a seven passenger sedan the drivable early prototype of model s was exhibited to the public in march 2009 and as of december 31 2011 we had received over 8000 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of 5000 

we plan to offer model s with a variety of battery pack options—40 kwh 60 kwh and 85 kwh—which we estimate will offer a range on a single charge of 160 miles 230 miles and 300 miles respectively while traveling at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour we expect that these options will allow customers to purchase an electric vehicle that best matches their personal driving needs the epa’s new fuel economy requirements 

  

will require us to label model s utilizing new and different energy efficiency testing methodologies these methodologies differ from the one we have used to estimate the range of the vehicles at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour and could reduce the range reported on the required labeling of our vehicles by up to 30 as compared to our current estimates 

to complement its range capabilities we also are offering model s with a package of recharging options we are offering the capability to fast charge model s vehicles equipped with either the 60 kwh or 85 kwh battery packs at one of tesla’s supercharger facilities which we plan to start installing at selected locations in the united states in 2012 we anticipate that the fast charge capability will allow model s owners to replenish 50 of the battery pack in about 30 minutes this feature would offer these drivers a rapid and convenient way to recharge their vehicles in addition we are designing model s to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility that we anticipate may be available in the future 

we are designing model s to offer a compelling combination of functionality convenience and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency with the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle we have designed model s to provide best in class storage space of 368 cubic feet including storage under both the tailgate and the hood by way of comparison this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 bmw 5 series sedan and the approximately 21 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 lincoln town car we are also planning to equip model s with premium luxury features including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface advanced wireless connectivity such as 3g connectivity and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle we are designing model s with the intent to achieve a five star safety rating we believe the intended combination of performance styling convenience and energy efficiency of model s will help position it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments 

we have announced that the 45 kwh 60 kwh and 85 kwh battery pack options of model s will have an effective base price of 49900 59900 and 69900 respectively in the united states assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles even without the tax credit we believe the base list price will be competitive with other premium vehicles we have also announced a performance version of model s equipped with the 85 kwh battery pack and a high performance drive inverter we anticipate that the model s performance version will accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 44 seconds the effective base price of the model s performance version is 84900 

we anticipate that the initial units of model s will be introduced with a signature series which will have an 85 kwh battery pack and include certain colors and interior options some of which may not be available in the general production of model s we also offer the signature series with a performance version the effective base price of the signature series is 87900 and the effective base price of the signature series performance version is 97900 

we are designing model s to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class we consider the purchase price cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation we assume comparable residual values warranties insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a model s purchase in addition to the competitive pricing of model s relative to other premium vehicles we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs for example assuming an average of 12000 miles driven per year an average electricity cost of 110 cents per kilowatthour and an average gasoline price of 338 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the united states respectively for january 2012 and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of model s we estimate that our model s could have approximately 1900 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan furthermore we expect model s will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components including oil oil filters spark plugs and engine valves 

  

model x and future vehicle roadmap 

we expect that model s will be manufactured with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of model s to create future electric vehicle models in particular by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development in addition we believe our strategy of using commercially available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options however we may make changes to the design of model s including changes that may make it more difficult to use the model s platform for future vehicles 

in february 2012 we revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as a dual motor allwheel drive system we currently plan to start production of model x in the fourth quarter of 2013 and ramp up to significant customer deliveries in early 2014 we anticipate that we will make model x available with 60kwh and 85 kwh battery pack options with pricing of each version similar to those of a comparably equipped model s we currently intend to target an annual production rate of approximately 10000 15000 cars per year from our tesla factory 

we have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle to be produced at the tesla factory we intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our model s we expect that this vehicle will be produced a few years after the introduction of the model x crossover 

powertrain development and sales 

in addition to our own vehicles we also design develop manufacture and sell advanced electric vehicle powertrain components 

in may 2009 we entered into a development agreement with daimler under which we performed specified research and development services for the development of a battery pack and charger for daimler’s smart fortwo electric drive all development work related to the development agreement had been completed as of december 31 2009 through december 2011 we had sold over 2100 battery packs and chargers for the smart fortwo electric drive program 

in the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 a formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with daimler in may 2010 in october 2010 we completed the development of the aclass battery pack and charger and began shipping production components for a demonstration fleet in february 2011 through december 2011 we had sold over 500 battery packs and chargers for the aclass ev program 

in the first quarter of 2010 we completed the development and sale of modular battery packs for electric delivery vans for freightliner custom chassis corporation freightliner an affiliate of daimler freightliner plans to use these electric vans in a limited number of customer trials 

in may 2010 we and toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles and for us to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for model s in july 2010 we entered into an early phase agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with an aim by toyota to market the electric vehicle in the united states in 2012 prototypes would be made by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain we began developing and delivering prototypes to toyota for evaluation in september 2010 in october 2010 we entered into a contract services 

  

agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to our agreements toyota would pay us up to 69 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance we expect to complete all of the development services for the rav4 ev in the first quarter of 2012 

additionally in july 2011 we entered into an agreement to supply toyota with an electric powertrain system for the rav4 ev we plan to begin delivery of these systems to toyota for installation into the toyota rav4 ev in the first half of 2012 our production activities under this program are expected to continue through 2014 

in february 2012 we received an initial purchase order for the development of a full electric powertrain system for an additional mercedes vehicle from daimler we are negotiating the agreement for production parts for this project however no agreement has yet been executed and there are no assurances that we will be able to enter into any such agreement 

we are continuing to develop our electric powertrain component and systems activities and have secured a 1012 million loan under our doe loan facility for the expansion of our engineering and production capability for these activities in our palo alto facility this facility which also serves as our corporate headquarters houses our research and development services including cell and component testing and prototyping as well as manufacturing of powertrain components for sales to third parties 

technology 

we believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain and vehicle engineering our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain our electric powertrain consists of the following battery pack power electronics motor gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system we designed each of these major elements for our tesla roadster and plan to use much of this technology in model s model x our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology further our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain these features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers 

battery pack 

we design our battery packs to safely store significant amounts of energy and to have long lives for example we have designed our tesla roadster battery packs to store 53 kilowatt hours of useful energy and to have a life of over 100000 miles or seven years in addition we have designed our battery packs to be modular so that we can leverage technology developments across our different vehicles and products our proprietary technology includes cooling systems safety systems charge balancing systems battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability robotic manufacturing processes customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding reallife driving conditions we have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithiumion cells in the demanding automotive environment we believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatthour 

we believe one of our core competencies is the design of our complete battery pack system we have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry form factor and vendor that we adopt for battery cell supply in so doing we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the 

  

cost per kilowatthour of our battery pack we maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithiumion cell vendors and chemistry types we intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity longevity power delivery and cost we believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles we believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software electronics testing and vehicle packaging will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology 

the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage time and charging patterns a customer’s use of their tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery’s ability to hold a charge for example we currently expect that the tesla roadster battery pack will retain approximately 6065 of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100000 miles or seven years which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range in addition based on internal testing we estimate that our tesla roadster would have a 510 reduction in range when operated in 20°c temperatures 

to date we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries form factors and designs based on this evaluation we are presently using lithiumion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs these battery cells are commercially available in large quantities we currently intend to use the same battery cell form factor in model s and model x we recently entered into a supply agreement with panasonic corporation panasonic for the use of panasonic’s battery cells in model s we expect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the tesla roadster 

power electronics 

the power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack the power electronics has two primary functions the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging 

the first function is accomplished through the drive inverter which converts direct current dc from the battery pack into alternating current ac to drive our threephase induction motors the drive inverter also converts the ac generated by regenerative braking back into dc for electrical storage in the battery pack the drive inverter performs this function by using a highperformance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle in so doing the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle 

the second function charging the battery pack is accomplished by the charger which converts alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current which can be accepted by the battery the charger enables us to use any available source of power to charge our vehicle our vehicles can recharge on any electrical outlet from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts all the way up to a high power outlet of 70 amps and 240 volts which provides faster recharging 

since the charger system is built into our vehicles it is possible to charge our vehicles using a variety of power outlets for example charging the tesla roadster battery pack to full capacity will take approximately 7 hours using a 240 volt 40 amp outlet that is widely available in many homes in the united states for electric appliances a high power connection capable of 240 volts and 70 amps reduces this charging time to about 45 hours such a connection can be installed in many homes with the assistance of a qualified electrician for additional flexibility the tesla roadster battery pack can also be charged with a 120 volt 15 amp connection 

  

using this lower power output the tesla roadster battery pack can be charged to full capacity in about 42 hours this flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home 

we offer a highvoltage fast charge option for model s with the 60 kwh and 85 kwh battery pack options that will enable the vehicle to charge from tesla’s supercharger network that we anticipate may be available in the future 

motor 

our powertrains currently use custom designed 3phase induction motors we believe we have made several important innovations in our motor design that minimize mass while still providing high power and efficiency our motors incorporate a proprietary fabricated copper rotor design our motors also include optimized winding patterns that allow for easy manufacture and fit in as much copper as possible to reduce resistance and energy losses 

gearbox 

we have designed custom single speed gearboxes that are manufactured inhouse for the tesla roadster and model s these gearboxes combine low mass with high efficiency and can match both the speed and torque capabilities of our ac induction motors in comparison to a gasolinepowered vehicle the elimination of gear changes contributes to the rapid acceleration characteristics of our vehicles 

control software 

the performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software there are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors the flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle for example software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the “creep” feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator similar algorithms control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle drivers use the information systems in our vehicles to optimize performance and charging modes and times software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems in addition to the vehicle control software we are also developing software for the infotainment system of model s 

vehicle design and engineering 

in addition to the design development and production of the powertrain we have created significant inhouse capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems we design and engineer bodies chassis interiors heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models 

several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle for example we redesigned the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine in addition low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio power windows and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle we have developed expertise in integrating these components with the highvoltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle 

  

additionally our team has expertise in lightweight materials a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range the tesla roadster is built with an internallydesigned carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass we intend to build model s with a lightweight aluminum body and have been designing the body and chassis with a variety of materials and production methods that will help optimize the weight of the vehicle we are developing an integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in fremont california the tesla factory to assemble vehicles and manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of model s our engineering and manufacturing teams are working alongside one another in an effort to accelerate the model s development we believe the colocation of our engineering and manufacturing teams will help accelerate the development of new products and allow for faster introduction of product changes 

sales and marketing 

companyowned sales 

we market and sell cars directly to consumers until we opened our first store in los angeles california in may 2008 all of our sales of the tesla roadster were conducted via the phone and internet or inperson at our headquarters and corporate events increasingly sales are being made through our network of tesla stores our tesla stores are highly visible premium outlets in major metropolitan markets some of which combine retail sales and service we intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets in april 2011 we opened our store at santana row in san jose california the opening of our santana row store launched what we believe to be a new retail experience designed to engage and inform potential customers about electric vehicles in general and the advantages of the tesla experience in particular we have opened five other locations modeled on this concept to complement a network of 20 sales and service locations in north america europe and asia we plan to open additional stores and service centers during 2012 with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores and additional service centers globally within the next several years in connection with our model s rollout 

we believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and service model our customers deal directly with our own teslaemployed sales and service staff creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers we believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing maintain and strengthen the tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback further we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer 

reservations 

we typically carry very limited inventory of our vehicles at our tesla stores while some customers purchase their vehicles from this inventory most of our tesla roadster customers choose to customize the appearance of their vehicle potential customers who purchase tesla roadsters manufactured to specification are required to enter into a purchase agreement and pay a nonrefundable deposit which is applied towards the purchase price of the vehicle for vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms no deposit is required for our 2011 model year tesla roadsters manufactured to specification our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial deposit which varies based on the country of purchase for model s and model x we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least 5000 we require nonrefundable deposits for tesla roadsters manufactured to specification we also occasionally accept refundable reservation payments if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications we currently require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the 

  

customer reservation payments and deposits are used by us to fund in part our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand for customers who have placed a refundable reservation payment with us the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement 

as of december 31 2011 we had received over 8000 customer reservations for model s as of december 31 2011 we held reservation payments for model s sedans in an aggregate of 900 million and reservation payments for undelivered tesla roadsters in an aggregate of 18 million all reservation payments for model s are fully refundable until such time that a customer enters into a purchase agreement 

leasing 

we began offering a leasing alternative to customers of our tesla roadster in the united states and canada in 2010 through wholly owned subsidiaries under this program we have permitted qualifying customers in the united states to lease the tesla roadster for generally 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we are using a third party provider to administer the back office services including billing and collections of the leases 

marketing 

our principal marketing goals are to 

 

  

  

  

 as the first company to commercially produce a federallycompliant fully electric vehicle that achieves marketleading range on a single charge we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles and we believe we will continue to do so to date media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs we also use traditional means of advertising including product placement in a variety of media outlets and payperclick advertisements on websites and applications relevant to our target demographics 

our marketing efforts include events where our vehicles are displayed and demonstrated these events range from widely attended public events such as the detroit los angeles and frankfurt auto shows to smaller events oriented towards sales such as private drive events 

companyowned charging network service and warranty 

tesla supercharger network 

during 2012 we plan to introduce a network of 90 kwh fast charging equipment each called a tesla supercharger throughout north america for fast charging of model s the tesla supercharger is an industrial grade high speed charger designed to replenish 50 of the battery pack in about 30 minutes access to the supercharger network will be available to owners of model s vehicles with the 60 kwh and 85 kwh battery pack options 

service 

service of our electric vehicles takes place at most of our tesla stores going forward we intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets within countries that are covered by our warranty agreement we offer at home service through our mobile service technicians known as the tesla rangers we 

  

charge customers a fixed rate per mile for our tesla rangers technicians’ return trip from the location of the customer’s vehicle to the nearest tesla store for customers that are not covered by our warranty agreement we offer at home service at a higher cost 

tesla owners can upload data from their vehicle and send it to us on a memory card or via an onboard gsm system allowing us to diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle when maintenance or service is required a customer can schedule service by contacting one of our regional tesla stores our tesla rangers can perform an array of procedures at a remote location from annual inspections and firmware upgrades to full replacement of a power electronics module and other mechanical and electrical components if service is more extensive and requires a vehicle lift we can coordinate shipping of vehicles to and from the nearest tesla store 

we believe that our companyowned service enables our technicians to work closely with our engineers and research and development teams in silicon valley to identify problems find solutions and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers 

new vehicle limited warranty policy 

we provide a three year or 36000 miles new vehicle limited warranty with every tesla roadster which we extended to four years or 50000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 tesla roadster customers have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36000 miles whichever comes first the new vehicle limited warranty is similar to other vehicle manufacturer’s warranty programs and is intended to cover all parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems battery powertrain and brake system exceptions to the new vehicle limited warranty include wear items such as tires brake pads and rotors paint wear and tear interior wear and tear and battery performance we intend to announce our new vehicle limited warranty for model s in 2012 

battery replacement option 

while battery failure due to defects in material or workmanship is included in the tesla roadster new vehicle limited warranty battery performance specifically its ability to store electricity over time is not covered in either the new vehicle limited warranty or the extended service plan however within three months of purchasing a vehicle customers may purchase a onetime option to replace the battery pack at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle for customers that select this option we agree to replace the original battery pack of the vehicle with a replacement battery pack which will store at least 53 kilowatthours of usable energy charges in addition to the option purchase price apply if the customer exercises the battery pack replacement option prior to the seventh anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle the customer is entitled to a partial refund of the option purchase price if the option is not elected by the eighth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle 

manufacturing 

vehicle assembly 

we completed the production of tesla roadster gliders at lotus cars limited in january 2012 we have a limited inventory of roadsters for sale primarily in europe and asia in 2012 as of december 31 2011 we had delivered approximately 2150 roadsters to customers 

we have nearly completed the tesla factory an integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in fremont california to manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of model s including stamping plastics body assembly paint operations battery pack manufacturing final vehicle assembly and endofline testing certain major component systems will be purchased from suppliers we 

  

currently intend to target an annual production rate at this facility for model s of approximately 20000 cars per year we believe that we will be able to increase the annual production capacity of this plant beyond this amount through additional capital spending as well as by changing operating patterns and adding additional shifts 

powertrain component manufacturing 

in addition to developing our model s and future vehicle manufacturing capabilities at the tesla factory we are currently designing developing and manufacturing lithiumion battery packs electric motors gearboxes and components both for our vehicles and for our original equipment manufacturer customers these activities occur at our electric powertrain manufacturing facility in palo alto california and at the tesla factory 

supply chain 

model s uses over 2000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 200 suppliers many of whom are currently our single source suppliers for these components we have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain electric powertrain components while we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source 

to date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain longterm agreements with our suppliers while we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us for example while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have fully qualified only one supplier for these cells any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative suppliers on a timely basis moreover battery cell manufactures may not supply us at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe 

we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials we believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements there are always risks and uncertainties however with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities or reasonable prices to meet our needs 

quality control 

our quality control efforts are divided between product quality and supplier quality both of which are focused on designing and producing products and processes with high levels of reliability our product quality engineers work with our engineering team and our suppliers to help ensure that the product designs meet functional specifications and durability requirements our supplier quality engineers work with our suppliers to ensure that their processes and systems are capable of delivering the parts we need at the required quality level on time and on budget our quality systems engineers create and manage our systems such as configuration management and corrective action systems to help ensure product developers supplier chain managers and production controllers have the product information they need 

customers and selected relationships 

we currently sell our cars primarily to individual customers we have strategic or commercial relationships with daimler toyota and panasonic we intend to expand our business by developing and selling additional powertrain components and systems to daimler toyota and other third party oems and have secured a 1012 million loan under our doe loan facility to fund the infrastructure these activities 

  

daimler ag 

beginning in 2008 we commenced efforts on a powertrain development arrangement with daimler in may 2009 we entered into a development agreement with daimler under which we have performed specified research and development services for the development of a battery pack and charger for daimler’s smart fortwo electric drive all development work related to the development agreement had been completed as of december 31 2009 through december 2011 we had sold over 2100 battery packs and chargers for the smart fortwo electric drive program in the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 a formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with daimler in may 2010 in october 2010 we completed the development of the aclass battery pack and charger and began shipping production parts in february 2011 through december 2011 we sold over 500 battery packs and chargers for the aclass ev program in the first quarter of 2010 we completed the development and sale of modular battery packs for electric delivery vans for freightliner an affiliate of daimler freightliner plans to use these electric vans in a limited number of customer trials 

in february 2012 we received an initial purchase order for the development of a full electric powertrain system for an additional mercedes benz vehicle from daimler we are negotiating the agreement for production parts for this project however no agreement has yet been executed and there are no assurances that we will be able to enter into any such agreement 

in addition to the agreements described above we have entered into an exclusivity and intellectual property agreement eip agreement with daimler north america corporation dnac an affiliate of daimler in which we agreed to begin negotiating in good faith to enter into further agreements within certain strategic cooperation areas including technology collaboration in various electric powertrain areas automotive engineering support joint electric vehicle development efforts and access to component parts for tesla designed products under this eip agreement we agreed that until november 11 2009 we would not negotiate or enter into any agreements with other parties that would be competitive with the arrangements contemplated for these strategic cooperation areas unless the results of such arrangement would be marketed solely under the tesla brand as of that date we had not executed any further agreements with daimler in the areas of strategic cooperation 

the eip agreement provides that ending july 2013 if the company receives an offer from a strategic competitor of daimler to enter into an agreement for development of a nontesla branded vehicle or an integrated electric powertrain system dnac would be given the right of first refusal to enter into such agreement with the company instead of and on the same terms offered by the third party 

the eip agreement also provides that if we execute a strategic cooperation agreement with dnac to jointly engineer an electric vehicle then additional exclusivities would apply until july 2013 provided a minimum annual volume of sales is achieved the eip agreement provides that none of the restrictions set out in that agreement or in any strategic agreement would limit us from developing technology with any third party for use in a teslabranded product or service or related to the tesla roadster or model s engaging in any transaction with a company that is not a daimler competitor or supplying components for electric powertrains that are designed by third parties 

the eip agreement also provides that if the parties enter into the strategic agreements or further agreements those agreements will allocate intellectual property rights according to certain principles outlined in the eip agreement in addition until july 2013 before licensing intellectual property generated outside the scope of any strategic cooperation area to a daimler competitor we would first have to offer dnac the right to license the intellectual property on a nonexclusive royaltybearing basis or on an exclusive basis in the automotive field and if dnac requests the latter we must negotiate such a license in good faith if no agreement is reached however we would be free to license the technology to the daimler competitor and dnac could take a nonexclusive license both we and daimler have the right to terminate the eip agreement 

  

in the event the other party undergoes or executes an agreement to undergo a change of control any strategic cooperation agreements entered into between us and daimler prior to termination will not be affected by such termination 

to date with the exception of the development agreement for the smart fortwo electric drive and the agreement for the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of daimler’s aclass electric vehicles the strategic agreements described in the eip agreement have not been entered into and there can be no assurance that the parties will ever enter into such agreements even if we were to enter into such agreements the parties may negotiate and agree to terms that are different to those set forth in the eip agreement and outlined above such different or new terms may be more or less favorable to us 

in addition to these agreements blackstar lnvestco llc blackstar an affiliate of daimler beneficially owned 8113215 shares of our common stock as of december 31 2011 blackstar’s representative dr herbert kohler serves as a member of our board of directors 

toyota motor corporation 

in may 2010 we and toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles and for us to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for model s in july 2010 we entered into an early phase agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with an aim by toyota to market the electric vehicle in the united states in 2012 prototypes would be made by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain we began developing and delivering prototypes to toyota for evaluation in september 2010 

in october 2010 we entered into a contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to our agreements toyota will pay us up to 69 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance we expect to complete all of the development services for the rav4 ev in the first quarter of 2012 

additionally in july 2011 we entered into an agreement to supply toyota with electric powertrain system for the rav4 ev we plan to begin delivery of these systems to toyota for installation into the toyota rav4 ev in the first half of 2012 our production activities under this program are expected to continue through 2014 

in addition to these agreements in july 2010 we sold 2941176 shares of our common stock to toyota at our ipo price of 1700 per share 

panasonic 

panasonic is a supplier of battery cells for our battery packs in january 2010 we announced that we were collaborating with panasonic on the development of nextgeneration electric vehicle cells based on the 18650 form factor and nickelbased lithium ion chemistry in october 2011 we finalized a supply agreement for these battery cells the agreement supplies us with battery cells to build more than 80000 vehicles over the next four years 

in november 2010 we sold 1418573 shares of our common stock to an entity affiliated with panasonic corporation at a price of 2115 per share which was the average of the trading highs and lows of our common stock from october 25 to october 29 2010 

  

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

united states department of energy loans 

on january 20 2010 we entered into a loan facility with the federal financing bank ffb and the united states department of energy doe under the doe’s advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program as set forth in section 136 of the energy independence and security act of 2007 atvm program we refer to such loan facility including amendments thereto as the doe loan facility under the doe loan facility ffb has made available to us two multidraw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to 4650 million and the doe has agreed to reimburse ffb for any liabilities losses costs or expenses incurred by ffb with respect to the term loan facilities up to an aggregate principal amount of 1012 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to 80 of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the powertrain engineering and the buildout of a facility to design and manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors and electric components the powertrain facility up to an aggregate principal amount of 3639 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80 of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the development of and to build out the manufacturing facility for our model s sedan the model s facility under the doe loan facility we are responsible for the remaining 20 of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project 

through december 31 2011 we have received draw downs under the doe loan facility for an aggregate of 2763 million with interest rates ranging from 10 to 34 for eligible project costs under both projects that we have incurred from december 15 2008 through november 30 2011 in february 2012 we received additional loans under the doe loan facility for 144 million at interest rates ranging from 09 to 14 

in connection with the doe loan facility we have also issued the doe a warrant to purchase up to 3085011 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 754 per share and a warrant to purchase up to 5100 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 894 per share beginning on december 15 2018 and until december 14 2022 the shares subject to purchase under these warrants will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter these warrants may be exercised until december 15 2023 if we prepay the doe loan facility in full prior to december 15 2018 no shares will be exercisable under these warrants except in the case of an event of default which could accelerate the vesting 

for more information on the doe loan facility see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives 

in december 2009 we finalized an arrangement with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority caeatfa that will result in an exemption from california state sales and use taxes for up to 320 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales and use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately 31 million over a three year period starting in december 2009 the equipment purchases may be used only for three purposes i to establish our production facility for model s in california ii to upgrade our palo alto powertrain production facility and iii to expand our current tesla roadster assembly operations at our menlo park facility as of december 31 2011 we have received the tax exemption for approximately 979 million in qualifying purchases 

in january 2012 we finalized an additional agreement with caeatfa that will result in an exemption from california state sales and use taxes for up to 292 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales and use tax we believe this 

  

incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately 24 million over a three year period starting in december 2011 the equipment purchases may be used only for two purposes i to develop the model x crossover vehicle and its production capacity in california and ii to further upgrade our powertrain production facilities in california as of january 31 2012 we had not begun to submit qualifying equipment for this exemption 

california air resources board’s zero emissions vehicle program 

in connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in a number of states we have earned and will continue to earn tradable credits that can be sold under california’s lowemission vehicle regulations and similar laws in other states vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles currently the states of arizona california connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new jersey new mexico new york oregon rhode island and vermont have such laws in effect these laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits referred to as zev credits and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements as a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles we earn zev credits on each vehicle sold in such states and have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the zev credits that we earn recently california passed amendments to the zev mandate that would require all large volume manufacturers those manufacturers selling 20000 or more vehicles in california to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold under the new requirements by 2025 up to 154 of each large volume manufacturers’ fleet must be made of zero emission vehicles 

we have entered into three contracts for the sale of zev credits with three separate automotive manufacturers for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we earned revenue from the sale of zev credits of 27 million 28 million and 82 million respectively our current agreement with an automotive manufacturer provides for the sale of a partial quantity of the zev credits that we earn from the sale of vehicles that we manufacture in 2012 with an option for additional sales of uncommitted credits in future model years we have also entered into a third contract with another automotive manufacturer to sell zev credits earned from the sale of model s vehicles in 2012 to the extent we have additional zev credits available for sale we may enter into new agreements with automotive manufacturers to sell such credits 

regulation—vehicle safety and testing 

our vehicles are subject to and the tesla roadster complies with or is exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that a vehicle meets or otherwise obtain an exemption from all applicable fmvsss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard before the vehicle can be imported into or sold in the united states there are numerous fmvsss that apply to our vehicles examples of these requirements include 

 

  

  

   

  

 as a small volume manufacturer that produces only electric vehicles we have applied for and have been granted exemptions from certain advanced air bag and electronic stability control requirements which apply to tesla roadsters manufactured through november 7 2011 under us law we are required to certify compliance with or obtain exemption from all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the united states based on testing engineering analysis and other information we have certified that the tesla roadster complies with or is exempt from all applicable nhtsa standards by affixing a certification label to each tesla roadster sold 

we are also required to comply with other requirements of federal laws administered by nhtsa including the corporate average fuel economy standards consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements 

our vehicles sold in europe are subject to european union safety testing regulations many of those regulations referred to as european union whole vehicle type approval wvta are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the united states and may require redesign andor retesting our tesla roadsters are currently approved for sale on a limited basis in the european union via the small series wvta which permits the manufacture and sale in the european union of no more than 1000 vehicles per year since we have fewer than 1000 tesla roadsters left to sell we have no plans to commence testing our tesla roadsters for the wvta to assure compliance with the european union requirements to permit unlimited sales similarly australia and japan have additional testing regulations applicable to high volume manufacturers we also plan to keep australian and japanese sales of our tesla roadsters at a low volume and have no plans to comply with the australian and japanese requirements to permit high volume sales in these jurisdictions in connection with the introduction of the tesla roadster in australia and japan we conducted a frontal impact test based on european union testing standards on the tesla roadster in november 2009 which is required for sales exceeding certain annual volumes outside the united states while the tesla roadster met most of the criteria for occupant protection and all criteria for high voltage safety in the front impact crash test there were two criteria that were not met in the test based on our analysis of additional compliance options in australia and japan we believe such an outcome should not limit our ability to sell the tesla roadster in australia below certain annual volumes or subject to compliance with certain japanese import rules have a material impact on our ability to sell tesla roadsters in japan 

the federal trade commission ftc requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle’s window the ftc specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the society of automotive engineers sae which further requires that we test using the united states epa’s combined city and highway testing cycles in july 2011 the epa announced new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles these new requirements when applied to our vehicles could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles by up to 30 as compared to methodologies we have used to estimate the range of the vehicles at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour shortly after the epa issued their new requirements the ftc issued a proposed rule that would harmonize current ftc label requirements with the epa’s new fuel economy label requirements if finalized changes to the testing cycles previously utilized could impair our ability to deliver model s with the previously advertised range based on the steady speed of 55 miles per hour range methodology which could result in the cancellation of a number of the over 8000 reservations that have been placed for model s as of december 31 2011 although the real life customer experience of the range of our electric vehicles will not change due to the changes in the ftc or epa standards the reduction in the advertised range could negatively impact our sales and harm our business 

  

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition the act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted 

regulation—epa emissions  certificate of conformity 

the clean air act requires that we obtain a certificate of conformity issued by the epa and a california executive order issued by the california air resources board carb with respect to emissions for our vehicles including model s the certificate of conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the clean air act’s standards and both the certificate of conformity and the executive order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the epa to utilize california standards the california standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in california are set by carb states that have adopted the california standards as approved by epa also recognize the executive order for sales of vehicles 

regulation—battery safety and testing 

our battery pack conforms with mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation which includes lithiumion batteries the governing regulations which are issued by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa are based on the un recommendations on the safe transport of dangerous goods model regulations and related un manual tests and criteria the regulations vary by mode of transportation when these items are shipped such as by ocean vessel rail truck or by air 

we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the un manual of tests and criteria including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we also subject our battery packs to the appropriate tests specified in the society of automotive engineers sae j2464 and j2929 which include further tests such as immersion humidity and exposure to fire 

we use lithium metal oxide cells in our battery packs the cells do not contain any lead mercury cadmium or other hazardous materials heavy metals or any toxic materials our battery packs include certain packaging materials which contain trace amounts of various hazardous chemicals whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs if a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation 

state law regulates the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally requires motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed to the extent possible we plan to secure dealer licenses or the equivalent of a dealer license and engage in activities as a motor vehicle dealer in so far as we are permitted to do so as we open additional tesla stores some states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as 

  

dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer to the extent permitted by local law both the actual sale and all activities related to the sale would generally have to occur out of state in this scenario it is possible that activities related to marketing advertising taking orders taking reservations and reservation payments and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state’s motor vehicle industry laws regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities 

in jurisdictions where we do not have a tesla store a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet however some states such as kansas have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of kansas in order to sell vehicles to kansas residents such laws may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state before we sell vehicles to residents of such states in some states where we have opened a viewing “gallery” that is not a full retail location it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer laws although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance a state could also take action against us including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities in addition some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities 

the foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles in many states the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent particularly with respect to sales over the internet and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state how the sale transaction is structured the volume of sales into the state and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers as a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state 

california laws and potentially the laws of other states restrict the ability of licensed dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before they are available in november 2007 we became aware that the new motor vehicle board of the california department of transportation has considered whether our reservation and advertising policies comply with these laws to date we have not received any communications on this topic from the new motor vehicle board or the department of motor vehicles dmv which has the power to enforce these laws there can be no assurance that the dmv will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law we expect that if the dmv determines that we may have violated the law it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance if we are ultimately found to be in violation of california law we might be precluded from taking reservation payments and the dmv could take other actions against us including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program the dmv also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in california following a hearing on the merits which it has typically exercised only in cases of significant or repeat violations andor a refusal to comply with dmv directions 

certain states may have specific laws which apply to dealers or manufacturers selling directly to consumers or both for example the state of washington requires that reservation payments or other payment 

  

received from residents in the state of washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer consequently we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of washington in january 2010 there can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payment received from customers our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity 

furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time 

in addition to licensing laws specific laws and regulations in each of the states and their interpretation by regulators may limit or determine how we sell market advertise and otherwise solicit sales take orders take reservations and reservation payments deliver and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state while we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have tesla stores we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices 

competition 

competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving we believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for occupant safety and vehicle emissions technological advances in powertrain and consumer electronics components and shifting customer needs and expectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electricbased vehicles we believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology within the electricbased vehicle segment there are three primary means of powertrain electrification which will differentiate various competitors in this market 

 

  

   

  

 the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future prior to the introduction of the nissan leaf in december 2010 no mass produced performance highwaycapable electric vehicles were being sold in the united states in japan mitsubishi has been selling its electric imiev since april 2010 we expect additional competitors to enter the united states and europe within the next several years and as they do so we expect that we will experience significant competition with respect to our tesla roadster we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers including manufacturers of highperformance vehicles such as porsche and ferrari in addition upon the launch of our model s sedan we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes 

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market for example nissan introduced the nissan leaf a fully electric vehicle in december 2010 and ford has announced that it plans to introduce the pure electric ford focus and plugin hybrid ford cmax in 2012 in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles for example in december 2010 general motors introduced the chevrolet volt which is a plugin hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery 

moreover it has been reported that bmw daimler lexus audi renault and volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles several new startups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles although none of these have yet come to market finally electric vehicles have already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well 

most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do in addition almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design develop market and sell their products more effectively we believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components as well as our history of vehicle development and production are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition however we have a limited history of operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends at least in part on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of patents patent applications trade secrets including knowhow employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws trademarks intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology as of december 31 2011 we had 59 issued patents and more than 230 pending patent applications with the united states patent and 

  

trademark office and internationally in a broad range of areas our issued patents start expiring in 2026 we intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims even if granted there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection 

seasonality 

sales of the tesla roadster have fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters we note that in general automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of model s model x and other electric vehicles we introduce in the future may have similar seasonality however our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business we do not expect our powertrain component sales and development services revenue to be impacted to a significant extent by seasonality 

segment information 

we have determined that we operate as one reporting segment which is the design development manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles and electric powertrain components for information regarding financial data by geographic areas see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business and industry 

our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment 

you must consider the risks and difficulties we face as an early stage company with a limited operating history if we do not successfully address these risks our business prospects operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed we were formed in july 2003 we began delivering our first performance electric vehicle the tesla roadster in early 2008 and as of december 31 2011 we had only sold approximately 2150 roadsters to customers almost all of which were sold in the united states and europe our revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were 2042 million 1167 million and 1119 million respectively we have a very limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business operating results and prospects 

to date we have derived our revenues principally from sales of the tesla roadster and from electric powertrain development services and sales we intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of our model s sedan our model x crossover and future electric vehicles model s is in development and we plan to commence deliveries by july 2012 we have no operating history with respect to model s and have not yet fully completed the component procurement process for model s which limits our ability to accurately forecast the cost of the vehicle further we have only recently produced an early prototype of the model x crossover we plan to start model x production in late 2013 and ramp to significant customer deliveries in early 2014 we only completed the purchase of our tesla factory in fremont california in october 2010 to produce such vehicles and we have not yet completely finalized the full vehicle design or our engineering manufacturing or component supply plans for model s in addition our powertrain component sales development services revenue and powertrain research and development compensation have been almost entirely generated under arrangements with daimler ag daimler and toyota motor corporation toyota while in november 2011 we received a letter of intent from daimler for a full electric powertrain program for a vehicle in the mercedes line and recently we received a purchase order to begin the development work we have not yet finalized with daimler the terms for this program and may never do so furthermore while we have executed a supply and services agreement with toyota related to the toyota rav4 ev program there are no assurances that we will be able to secure future business with daimler toyota or any of their affiliates 

it is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business for example during the years ended 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded quarterly revenues of as much as 582 million and as little as 186 million and quarterly operating losses of as much as 809 million and as little as 43 million in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 

in addition our revenues to date have included amounts we receive from selling zero emission vehicle zev credits to other automobile manufacturers pursuant to certain state regulations while we continue to sign agreements with automakers to sell zev and other regulatory credits we may not be able to enter into new agreements to sell any additional credits related to model s model x or our other future vehicles which would negatively impact our revenues and margin targets in the long term 

  

although we are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of the tesla roadster and our powertrain activities with other oems in the near term our future success will be dependent upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models specifically model s and model x 

we currently generate a significant percentage of our revenues from the sale of our tesla roadsters we ended the production run of the tesla roadster at 2500 vehicles in january 2012 and sales of new tesla roadsters are now limited to any vehicles available from our remaining inventory 

our second planned vehicle our model s will not be in production until mid2012 requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction and may never be successfully developed or commercially successful additionally there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models including model s and model x will become commercially viable to the extent that we are not able to build the production model s and model x to the expectations created by the early prototypes and our announced specifications customers may cancel their reservations our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us furthermore historically automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently in order to meet these expectations we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models as technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology to date we have limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing upgrading adapting and selling our electric vehicles 

we anticipate that we will experience a significant increase in losses and will experience a significant decrease in revenues prior to the launch of model s 

prior to the launch of our model s we anticipate our revenues will decline significantly as we have a limited supply of tesla roadsters remaining to be sold as a result we anticipate that we will generate limited revenues from selling electric vehicles in 2012 until the launch of our model s the launch of our model s could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited revenues from sales of our electric vehicles furthermore although we recently received a letter of intent and a purchase order from daimler for a full electric powertrain program for a vehicle in the mercedes line we have not yet finalized with daimler the terms for this program in addition to the limited number of the tesla roadsters left for sale we also expect powertrain component sales to be limited until the start of production for the toyota rav4 ev program during the first half of 2012 the potential decrease in sales revenue prior to the launch of model s due to declines in both roadster and powertrain component sales could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition and our ability to fund operating losses could seriously constrain our growth 

our production model for the nonpowertrain portion of model s is unproven still evolving and is very different from the nonpowertrain portion of the production model for the tesla roadster 

our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop manufacture market and sell our model s to date our revenues have been principally derived from the sales of our tesla roadster the tesla roadster has only been produced in low volume quantities and the body was assembled by lotus cars limited lotus in the united kingdom with the final assembly by us at our facility in menlo park california for sales destined in the united states we plan to manufacture model s in higher volumes at our tesla factory as a result the nonpowertrain portion of the production model for model s will be substantially different and significantly more complex than the nonpowertrain portion of the production model for the tesla roadster in addition for model s we plan to introduce a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques such as aluminum spot welding systems which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry and the vehicle will have a number of new and unique design features such as a 17 inch display screen newly designed retractable exterior door handles and a panoramic roof our model s production model will 

  

require significant investments of cash and management resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could postpone our ability to launch or achieve full manufacturing capacity for model s which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results and financial condition 

our production model for model s is based on many key assumptions which may turn out to be incorrect including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect and we are unable to successfully launch model s on time and on budget and to ramp to our planned volume production our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 

we have no experience to date in high volume manufacturing of our electric vehicles 

we do not know whether we will be able to develop efficient automated lowcost manufacturing capability and processes and reliable sources of component supply that will enable us to meet the quality price engineering design and production standards as well as the production volumes required to successfully mass market model s even if we are successful in developing our high volume manufacturing capability and processes and reliable sources of component supply we do not know whether we will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors or in time to meet our vehicle commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers we have and may in the future experience cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we 

  

make any failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results and financial condition 

we may experience significant delays in the design manufacture launch financing and ramping up of production of model s which could harm our business and prospects 

any delay in the financing design manufacture and launch of model s could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results automobile manufacturers often experience delays in the design manufacture and commercial release of new vehicle models we experienced significant delays in launching the tesla roadster we initially announced that we would begin delivering the tesla roadster in june 2007 but due to various design and production delays we did not physically deliver our first tesla roadster until february 2008 and we only achieved higher production of this vehicle in the fourth quarter of 2008 these delays resulted in additional costs and adverse publicity for our business 

we may experience similar delays in launching and ramping up production of model s and any such delays could be significant in addition final designs for model s and plans for the operation of the tesla factory using production tooling are still in process and have not yet been completely finalized we continue to make final adjustments to the design of model s to create the highest quality electric vehicle in the world if we do not complete these late stage changes to the design of model s however and do not execute on model s manufacturing plans in a timely manner we may be unable to meet our plan to deliver first customer vehicles by july 2012 or ramp up our planned production of model s in a timely manner our costs may rise andor model s that we do produce initially or after ramp up may be lower in quality additionally detailed testing of systems integration performance and safety are ongoing and any negative results from such testing could cause production delays in model s cost increases or lower quality model s vehicles 

in addition we are currently evaluating qualifying and selecting our remaining suppliers for the planned production of model s however we may not be able to engage suppliers for the remaining components in a timely manner at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities furthermore even if we are able to engage needed suppliers such suppliers may not be ready or able to supply us with needed model s components in a timely manner or may be unable to provide us with the necessary level of quality components that we require 

in addition we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that model s is in compliance with applicable national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa safety regulations and united states environmental protection agency epa and california air resources board carb emission regulations prior to beginning mass production and delivery of the vehicles 

our plan to begin production of model s in mid2012 is dependent upon the timely availability of funds from our doe loan facility upon our finalizing the related design engineering component procurement testing and manufacturing plans in a timely manner and upon our ability to execute these plans within the current timeline 

we completed the purchase of the tesla factory in october 2010 and selected it in part because it was recently used for automobile manufacturing was located within 20 miles of our palo alto engineering facility and we believe its size may allow us to adapt our internal manufacturing plans quickly we expect that all these factors will support the timely start of production for model s however because we are still implementing our manufacturing plans including the purchasing and installment of needed tooling we may experience unexpected delays in ramping up production at this facility for the production of our model s 

in january 2010 we entered into a loan facility with the federal financing bank ffb that is guaranteed by the doe doe loan facility our doe loan facility provides for a 4650 million loan facility under the doe’s advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program atvm program to help finance the continued development of model s including the build out and operation of a manufacturing facility and to 

  

finance the build out and operation of our electric powertrain manufacturing facility we intend to fund the final tooling purchases and the remaining model s related development expenses principally by using existing cash and cash obtained through the doe loan facility our ability to draw down these funds under the doe loan facility is conditioned upon certain draw conditions including our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of model s as well as financial covenants if we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the doe loan facility on the timeline that we anticipate our plans for building our model s and electric powertrain manufacturing plants could be significantly delayed which would materially adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we are dependent on our suppliers a significant number of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to continue to deliver or their refusal to deliver necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and operating results 

model s contains numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 200 direct suppliers many of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components while we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source while we are currently working to establish longterm agreements with our entire supplier base to date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain longterm agreements with our suppliers 

while we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us in particular while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for almost all of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle’s design 

this supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for model s as well as for our powertrain component sales activities for example earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in japan in march 2011 could negatively impact our supply chain we are currently evaluating qualifying and selecting our suppliers for the planned production of model s and we intend to establish dual suppliers and multiple manufacturing locations for some suppliers for several key components of model s although we expect that most of components for model s will be single sourced we have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains which have caused delays in our production process and we may experience additional delays in the future with respect to model s and any other future vehicle we may produce 

changes in business conditions wars governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis furthermore if we experience significant increased demand or need to replace certain existing suppliers there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us at all or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner in the past we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially adversely affect our business prospects and operating results 

changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost and delay for example a change in our supplier for our carbon fiber body panels contributed to the delay in our ability to ramp our production of the tesla roadster a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our performance electric vehicles such as our 

  

model s could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we face significant barriers in our attempt to produce our model s and if we cannot successfully overcome those barriers our business will be negatively impacted 

we face significant barriers as we attempt to produce our first mass produced vehicle our model s we currently have drivable prototypes of model s but do not have a final design or completely finalized manufacturing processes the automobile industry has traditionally been characterized by significant barriers to entry including large capital requirements investment costs of designing and manufacturing vehicles long lead times to bring vehicles to market from the concept and design stage the need for specialized design and development expertise regulatory requirements and establishing a brand name and image and the need to establish sales and service locations as a manufacturer and seller of only electric vehicles we face a variety of added challenges to entry that a traditional automobile manufacturer would not encounter including additional costs of developing and producing an electric powertrain that has comparable performance to a traditional gasoline engine in terms of range and power inexperience with servicing electric vehicles regulations associated with the transport of lithiumion battery packs and unproven highvolume customer demand for fully electric vehicles in addition while we are designing model s to have the capability to rapidly swap out its battery pack there are no specialized public facilities today to perform such swapping also while we expect to be able to achieve a 300 mile range while traveling at a speed of 55 miles per hour our ability to do so will depend on the feasibility and availability of appropriate battery cell technologies and improvements that we are able to achieve in reducing energy consumption we must successfully overcome these barriers as we move from producing the low volume tesla roadster to producing model s at much higher volumes if we are not able to overcome these barriers our business prospects operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed 

we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which would cause our stock price to decline 

we provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance correctly identifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process our guidance is based in part on assumptions which include but are not limited to assumptions regarding our ability to achieve anticipated volumes and projected average sales prices for our model s sedan assumptions regarding supplier and commodityrelated costs and assumptions regarding planned cost reductions such guidance may not always be accurate or may vary from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors we offer no assurance that such guidance will ultimately be accurate and investors should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution if we fail to meet our guidance or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance investors and analysts may lose confidence in us and the market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 

our vehicles make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications 

the battery pack in the tesla roadster makes use of lithiumion cells we also currently intend to make use of lithiumion cells in the battery pack for model s and any future vehicles we may produce on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells more recently multiple chevrolet volt battery pack fires followed by a government investigation into the cause of such fires focused considerable public attention as well as the attention of nhtsa on the safety of electric vehicles the events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications to address these questions and 

  

concerns a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithiumion battery cell chemistries to improve safety we have designed our battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells and we are not aware of any such incident in our customers’ vehicles we have tested the battery packs and subjected them to damaging treatments such as baking overcharging crushing or puncturing to assess our battery pack’s response to deliberate and sometimes destructive abuse however we have delivered only a limited number of tesla roadsters to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles especially model s additionally final safety testing for model s some versions of which use new higher density cells in their battery packs is currently in progress accordingly there can be no assurance that a field failure of our model s or other battery packs will not occur which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits we may have to redesign our battery packs which would be time consuming and expensive in addition negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications could seriously harm our business 

in addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our manufacturing facility any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall moreover any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to the tesla roadster or model s may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

if our vehicles fail to perform as expected or if we suffer product recalls for our upcoming model s our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed 

our vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair for example our vehicles use a substantial amount of software code to operate software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the longterm performance of our tesla roadster we have no frame of reference by which to evaluate our model s upon which our business prospects depend there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers we experienced product recalls in may 2009 and october 2010 both of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain in may 2009 we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider which is the partially assembled tesla roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain in october 2010 we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle although the cost of the most recent recall was not material we may experience additional recalls in the future which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets and could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations 

our electric vehicles including the tesla roadster and model s may not perform consistent with customers’ expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available for example our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market additionally while we are designing model s with the intent to achieve a five star safety rating and an estimated 300 mile range while traveling at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve these performance levels any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity lost revenue delivery delays product recalls product liability claims harm to our brand and reputation and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

  

we have a history of losses and we expect significant increases in our costs and expenses to result in continuing losses for at least the remainder of 2012 

we incurred a net loss of 2544 million for the year ended december 31 2011 in addition we have accumulated net losses of 6694 million from our inception through december 31 2011 we have had net losses in each quarter since our inception we believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of model s which is not expected to be in production until mid2012 with higher volume production not occurring until 2013 even if we are able to successfully develop model s there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful if we are to ever achieve profitability it will be dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of automobiles such as model s which may not occur 

we expect the rate at which we will incur losses to increase significantly in 2012 compared to prior years’ levels until significant deliveries of model s begin as we 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenues with respect thereto our losses in future periods will be significantly greater than the losses we would incur if we developed our business more slowly in addition we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in increases in our revenues which would further increase our losses 

in addition as of december 31 2011 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our united states net deferred tax assets as at this point we believe it is more likely than not that we will not achieve profitability and accordingly be able to use our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code although we do not believe that either our initial public offering ipo or subsequent followon offering or private placements constituted an ownership change resulting in limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have not yet performed a study to determine whether such limitations exist if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred as a result of our ipo subsequent followon offering or private placements utilization of these assets could be significantly reduced 

  

if we are unable to adequately control the costs associated with operating our business including our costs of manufacturing sales and materials our business financial condition operating results and prospects will suffer 

if we are unable to maintain a sufficiently low level of costs for designing manufacturing marketing selling and distributing and servicing our electric vehicles relative to their selling prices our operating results gross margins business and prospects could be materially and adversely impacted we have made and will be required to continue to make significant investments for the design manufacture and sales of our electric vehicles when we first began delivering our tesla roadster in early 2008 our marginal costs of producing the tesla roadster exceeded our revenue from selling those vehicles revenue from the sales of our tesla roadster as well as from zev credits did not exceed the cost of revenues related to our tesla roadster until the second quarter of 2009 there can be no assurances that our costs of producing and delivering model s will be less than the revenue we generate from the related sales at the time of model s launch or that we will achieve our expected gross margin on sales of model s 

we incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our highperformance electric cars assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel we will also incur substantial costs in constructing and building out our model s and powertrain manufacturing facilities each of which could potentially face cost overruns or delays in construction if our model s tooling production equipment and parts are insufficient for use in model x perhaps as a result of a lower level of commonality between the two vehicles than we currently anticipate our costs related to the production of model x may exceed expectations 

additionally in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles including through the use of traditional media such as television radio and print even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited if we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate our operating results business and prospects will be harmed many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control for example the costs of our raw materials and components such as lithiumion battery cells or aluminum body panels used in our vehicles could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases indeed if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology shortages could occur which would result in increased materials costs to us 

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials in particular lithiumion cells could harm our business 

we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials any such increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel nickel and copper the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for lithiumion cells these risks include 

 

  

  

  

   

our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles and for the battery pack we produce for other automobile manufacturers while we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for the tesla roadster and model s we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in each of the tesla roadster and model s the same is also true for the battery cells used for battery packs that we supply to other oems any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of model s and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices there can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices we have also recently announced pricing of model s any attempts to increase the announced prices in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by our customers result in cancellations of model s reservations and could materially adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results 

our future growth is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles 

our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular if the market for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new rapidly evolving characterized by rapidly changing technologies price competition additional competitors evolving government regulation and industry standards frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors 

other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles and specifically electric vehicles include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles based on internal testing we estimate that our tesla roadster would have a 510 reduction in range when operated in 20°c temperatures to the extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain widespread acceptance our ability to market and sell our vehicles particularly in colder climates may be adversely impacted 

additionally we will become subject to regulations that require us to alter the design of our vehicles which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicles for example our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles due to concerns about overly quiet vehicles and vision impaired pedestrians in january 2011 congress passed and the president signed the pedestrian safety enhancement act of 2010 the new law requires nhtsa to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds new standards must be proposed by mid2012 for implementation within three years of the act’s enactment date of january 3 2011 

the influence of any of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles which would materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and prospects 

our success could be harmed by negative publicity regarding our company or products 

from time to time our vehicles are evaluated by third parties for example the show top gear which airs on the british broadcasting corporation did a review of the tesla roadster in 2008 top gear is one of the most watched automotive shows in the world with an estimated 350 million viewers worldwide and is broadcast in over 100 countries since originally airing in the fall of 2008 the episode about the tesla roadster has been rebroadcast repeatedly around the world the review of the tesla roadster included a number of significant falsehoods regarding the car’s performance range and safety such criticisms create a negative public perception about the tesla roadster and to the extent that these comments are believed by the public may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles which would materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and prospects 

the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time which may negatively influence potential customers’ decisions whether to purchase our vehicles 

the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage time and charging patterns as well as other factors for example a customer’s use of their tesla vehicle as well as the 

  

frequency with which they charge the battery pack of their tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery pack’s ability to hold a charge we currently expect that our battery pack for the tesla roadster will retain approximately 6065 of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100000 miles or seven years which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles 

we are dependent upon our ability to fully draw down on our loan facility from the united states department of energy which may restrict our ability to conduct our business 

our plan for manufacturing model s and for developing our electric powertrain facility depends on our ability to fully draw down on our doe loan facility our doe loan facility provides for a 4650 million loan facility under the doe’s atvm program to help finance the continued development of model s including the build out and operation of a manufacturing facility and to finance the build out and operation of our electric powertrain manufacturing facility we cannot however access all of these funds at once but only through periodic draws through january 2013 as eligible costs are incurred through december 31 2011 we have received loans under our doe loan facility for an aggregate of 2763 million our ability to draw down these funds under the doe loan facility is conditioned upon specified draw conditions for the model s manufacturing facility project the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of model s additionally the doe loan facility requires us to comply with certain operating and financial covenants and places additional restrictions on our ability to operate our business if we do not comply with such requirements of the doe loan facility such failure if not waived by the doe could cause a default in the event of a default we would not be eligible to draw funds under the doe loan facility and existing outstanding loan amounts would become due immediately 

additionally if we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the doe loan facility or our ability to make such draw downs is delayed we may need to obtain additional or alternative financing to operate our model s and electric powertrain manufacturing facilities to the extent our cash on hand is insufficient any failure to obtain the remaining doe funds or secure other alternative funding could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects such additional or alternative financing may not be available on attractive terms if at all and could be more costly for us to obtain as a result our plans for the build out of our model s and electric powertrain manufacturing facilities could be significantly delayed which would materially adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our doe loan facility documents contain customary covenants that include among others a requirement that the project be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project compliance with all requirements of the atvm program and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness incur liens make investments or loans enter into mergers or acquisitions dispose of assets pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock prepay indebtedness pay management advisory or similar fees to affiliates enter into certain affiliate transactions enter into new lines of business and enter into certain restrictive agreements these restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and may cause us to take actions or prevent us from taking actions we believe are necessary from a competitive standpoint or that we otherwise believe are necessary to grow our business 

in addition our doe loan facility requires mr musk and certain of his affiliates until one year after we complete the project relating to the model s facility to own at least 65 of the tesla capital stock held by them as of the date of the doe loan facility and a failure to comply would be an event of default that could result in an acceleration of all obligations under the doe loan facility documents and the exercise of other remedies by the doe 

  

the operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and our customers may experience difficulty operating them properly including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking 

we have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain in certain instances these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles for example we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle however when the vehicle is at maximum charge the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed accordingly our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking in addition we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures in such instances the vehicle’s acceleration and speed will decrease finally if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains the vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected there can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly especially in these situations any accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation result in adverse publicity and product liability claims and have a material adverse affect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition if consumers dislike these features they may choose not to buy additional cars from us which could also harm our business and prospects 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advanced diesel ethanol fuel cells or compressed natural gas or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers which makes evaluating our business operating results and future prospects difficult 

our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today particularly in the united states we plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles over the internet and in companyowned tesla stores this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven especially in the united states and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires in the aggregate a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system for example we will not be able to utilize long established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume which may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results moreover we will be competing with companies with wellestablished distribution channels 

we have opened tesla stores in the united states europe and japan many of which have been open for less than one year we have only limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our tesla stores our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges in april 2011 we began the roll out of our new interactive store strategy the concept and layout of these new stores which are located in high profile retail centers is different than what has previously been used in automotive sales we do not know whether our new store strategy will be successful if consumers will be willing to purchase vehicles in this manner or if these locations will be deemed to comply with 

  

applicable zoning restrictions as well as approval and acceptance from the specific high profile retail centers in which we seek to locate our stores as a result we may incur additional costs in order to improve or change our retail strategy 

you must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks uncertainties and difficulties we encounter as we implement our business model for instance we will need to persuade customers suppliers and regulators of the validity and sustainability of our business model we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so or to successfully address the risks uncertainties and difficulties that our business strategy faces any failure to successfully address any of the risks uncertainties and difficulties related to our business model would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

we sell our vehicles from our tesla stores as well as over the internet we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the united states as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state for example the state of kansas provides that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a kansas resident except through a dealer licensed to do business in the state of kansas which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of kansas in order to sell vehicles to kansas residents in some states where we have opened a gallery which is a location where potential customers can view our vehicles but is not a full retail location it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer laws for example the state of colorado required us to obtain dealer and manufacturer licenses in the state in order to operate our gallery in colorado in addition some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities 

the foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles in many states the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws particularly with respect to sales over the internet and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state how the sale transaction is structured the volume of sales into the state and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers as a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators the manner in which the applicable authorities will apply their state laws to our distribution model is unknown such laws as well as other laws governing the motor vehicle industry may subject us to potential inquiries and investigations from state motor vehicle regulators who may question whether our sales model complies with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws and who may require us to change our sales model or may prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws such challenges if successful could prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states 

we are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in canada australia and japan and have obtained licenses to sell vehicles in other countries such as hong kong and singapore furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in 

  

which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time 

regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

reservations for model s and model x are fully refundable to customers and significant cancellations could harm our financial condition business prospects and operating results 

as of december 31 2011 we had unfilled reservations for over 8000 model s sedans all of which are subject to cancellation by the customer up until such time that the customer enters into a purchase agreement historically all of our reservations have been refundable and we have had a significant number of customers who submitted reservations for the tesla roadster cancel those reservations and we have refunded their deposits 

given the long lead times that we have historically experienced between customer reservation and delivery on the tesla roadster and that we expect to experience on model s and model x there is a heightened risk that customers that have made reservations may not ultimately take delivery on vehicles due to potential changes in customer preferences competitive developments and other factors for example when we delayed the introduction of the original tesla roadster in the fall of 2007 we experienced a significant number of customers that cancelled their reservations and requested the return of their reservation payment if we encounter delays in the introduction of model s or model x we believe that a significant number of our customers could similarly cancel their reservations and demand refunds of their reservation payments as a result no assurance can be made that reservations will not be cancelled and will ultimately result in the final purchase delivery and sale of the vehicle given the high level of reservations significant cancellations could harm our financial condition business prospects and operating results 

if we are unable to design develop market and sell new electric vehicles and services that address additional market opportunities our business prospects and operating results will suffer 

we may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles and services address new market segments or develop a significantly broader customer base to date we have focused our business on the sale of highperformance electric vehicles and have targeted relatively affluent consumers we will need to address additional markets and expand our customer demographic in order to further grow our business in particular we intend model s to appeal to the customers of premium vehicles which is a much larger and different demographic from that of the tesla roadster successfully offering a vehicle in this vehicle class requires delivering a vehicle with a higher standard of fit and finish in the interior and exterior than currently exists in the tesla roadster at a price that is competitive with other premium vehicles we have not completely finalized the design component sourcing or manufacturing process for model s so it is difficult to accurately forecast its final cost manufacturability or quality therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to deliver a vehicle that is ultimately competitive in the premium vehicle market in 2012 we publicly revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform we have also previously announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle which we expect to produce at the tesla factory after the introduction of model s however we have not yet finalized the design engineering or component sourcing plans for these vehicles and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring these vehicles to market at the price points and in the volumes as we currently intend if at all our failure to address additional market opportunities would harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

  

any changes to the federal trade commission’s electric vehicle range testing procedure and recent changes made by the united states environmental protection agency’s energy consumption regulations for electric vehicles could result in a reduction to the range of our vehicles as compared to the current combined twocycle test which could negatively impact our sales and harm our business 

the federal trade commission ftc requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle’s window the ftc specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the society of automotive engineers sae which further requires that we test using the epa’s combined city and highway testing cycles in july 2011 the epa established new requirements for the fuel economy stickers that appear on new cars offered for sale ie the monroney label we advertise that we plan to offer model s with a variety of battery pack options which we estimate will offer a range on a single charge of 160 miles 230 miles and 300 miles respectively while traveling at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour the epa’s new fuel economy requirements will require us to label model s utilizing new and different energy efficiency testing methodologies these methodologies differ from the one we have used to estimate the range of the vehicles at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour and could reduce the range reported on the required labeling of our vehicles by a derating factor which could be up to 30 as compared to our current estimates these new requirements apply to all model year 2013 and later vehicles however the epa has also indicated that they would like automobile manufacturers to utilize the new label format as soon as possible therefore it is possible that the epa will request that we utilize new labels sooner bearing lower range values any reduction in the advertised range of our vehicles could negatively impact our vehicle sales and harm our business 

if we are unable to effectively leverage the benefits of using an adaptable common platform architecture in the design and manufacture of future vehicles such as model x our business prospects operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

we intend to design model s with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of model s to create future electric vehicles including as an example our model x crossover vehicle however we have no experience with using common platforms in the design and manufacture of our vehicles and the design of model s is not complete we may make changes to the design of model s that may make it more difficult to use the model s platform for model x or for future electric vehicles that we decide to produce additionally we intend to use some of our model s manufacturing equipment and parts tooling for the production of model x if such tooling production equipment and parts are insufficient for use in model x perhaps as a result of a lower level of commonality between the two vehicles than we anticipate our costs related to the production of model x may exceed expectations there are no assurances that we will be able to use the model s platform to bring future vehicle models including the model x crossover to market faster or more inexpensively by leveraging use of this common platform or that there will be sufficient customer demand for any vehicles built on the model s platform 

we may experience significant delays in the design manufacture and launch of model x which could harm our business and prospects 

we plan to start model x production in late 2013 and ramp up to significant customer deliveries in early 2014 any delay in the design manufacture and launch of model x could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results automobile manufacturers often experience delays in the design manufacture and commercial release of new vehicle models we experienced significant delays in launching the tesla roadster which resulted in additional costs and adverse publicity for our business we may experience similar delays cost overruns and adverse publicity in launching model x any of which could be significant we are in the initial design and development stages of model x furthermore we have not yet begun to evaluate qualify or select suppliers for the planned production of model x and cannot begin to do so until the design of model x is finalized we may not be able to engage suppliers for the components in a timely manner at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that model x is in compliance with applicable nhtsa safety regulations and epa and carb emission regulations prior to beginning mass production and delivery of the vehicles in addition we have limited resources and to 

  

the extent that such resources are devoted to the manufacture and production of model s we may have difficulty producing and delivering our model x vehicle in a timely manner if we are not able to manufacture and deliver our model x in a timely manner and consistent with our budget and cost projections our business prospects operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed 

the automotive market is highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in this industry we currently face competition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future other automobile manufacturers entered the electric vehicle market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter this market with respect to our tesla roadster we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers including manufacturers of highperformance vehicles such as porsche and ferrari in addition upon the launch of our model s sedan we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes 

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market in japan mitsubishi has been selling its electric imiev since april 2010 in december 2010 nissan introduced in the united states the nissan leaf a fully electric vehicle and ford introduced the pure electric ford focus and plugin hybrid ford cmax in 2012 in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles for example in december 2010 general motors introduced the chevrolet volt which is a plugin hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack 

moreover it has been reported that many of the large oems such as bmw daimler lexus audi renault and volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles several new startups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles although none of these have yet come to market finally electric vehicles have already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well 

most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do in addition almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design develop market and sell their products more effectively 

furthermore certain large manufacturers offer financing and leasing options on their vehicles and also have the ability to market vehicles at a substantial discount provided that the vehicles are financed through their affiliated financing company we only began offering a leasing program in february 2010 which is currently only available to qualified tesla roadster customers in the united states and canada we do not currently plan to offer any lease financing on model s but may do so at a later date we have not in the past and do not currently offer customary discounts on our vehicles the lack of lease financing and the absence of customary vehicle discounts could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry factors affecting 

  

competition include product quality and features innovation and development time pricing reliability safety fuel economy customer service and financing terms increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and prospects our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets if our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality price or performance of our cars or services we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results 

volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition the markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods for example according to automotive industry sources sales of passenger vehicles in north america during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30 lower than those during the same period in the prior year demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general economic political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies as a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand as our business grows economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we sell our electric vehicles will impact our business prospects and operating results as well demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives prices of raw materials and parts and components cost of fuel and governmental regulations including tariffs import regulation and other taxes volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results these effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers 

difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer purchases of luxury items such as our performance electric vehicles 

over the last few years the deterioration in the global financial markets and continued challenging condition of the macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted consumer spending and we believe has adversely affected the sales of our tesla roadster the automobile industry in particular was severely impacted by the poor economic conditions and several vehicle manufacturing companies including general motors and chrysler were forced to file for bankruptcy sales of new automobiles generally have dropped during this recessionary period sales of highend and luxury consumer products such as our performance electric vehicles depend in part on discretionary consumer spending and are even more exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions difficult economic conditions could therefore temporarily reduce the market for vehicles in our price range discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors including changes in tax rates and tax credits interest rates and the availability and terms of consumer credit 

if the current difficult economic conditions continue or worsen we may experience a decline in the demand for our tesla roadster or reservations for our model s or future vehicles such as model x any of which could materially harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results accordingly any events that have a negative effect on the united states economy or on foreign economies or that negatively affect consumer confidence in the economy including disruptions in credit and stock markets and actual or perceived economic slowdowns may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

  

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to the seasonality of our business and fluctuations in our operating costs 

our operating results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to many factors including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles demand for new cars in the automobile industry in general and for highperformance sports vehicles such as the tesla roadster in particular typically decline over the winter season while sales are generally higher as compared to the winter season during the spring and summer months sales of the tesla roadster have fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters we note that in general automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of model s model x and other models we introduce may have similar seasonality however our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business also any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue 

in addition we expect our periodtoperiod operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we among other things design develop and manufacture our model s model x and electric powertrain components build and equip new manufacturing facilities to produce model s and electric powertrain components open new tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities incur costs for warranty repairs or product recalls if any increase our sales and marketing activities and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results especially in the shortterm are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors if any of this occurs the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time 

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industry then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially 

our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support if we were to cease or cut back operations even years from now buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support as a result consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed for example during the economic downturn of 2008 we had difficulty raising the necessary funding for our operations and as a result in the fourth quarter of 2008 we had to lay off approximately 60 employees and curtail our expansion plans in addition during this period a number of customers canceled their previously placed reservations if we are required to take similar actions in the future such actions may result in negative perceptions regarding our longterm business prospects and may lead to cancellations of model s or model x reservations 

accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts and other parties in our liquidity and longterm business prospects in contrast to some more established automakers we believe that in our case the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed 

we may need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

the design manufacture sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business as of december 31 2011 we had 4927 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility this includes our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 2553 million which includes investments in money market funds shortterm marketable securities of 251 million cash of 235 million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility and 1888 million available under the doe loan facility we expect that these principal sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity until we reach profitability in 2013 however if there are delays in the launch of model s or model x if we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the doe loan facility for any reason including our failure to meet operating or financial covenants or if the costs in building our model s model x and powertrain manufacturing facilities exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on new significant strategic investments we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions this capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects including those for our planned model x crossover establish sales and service centers improve infrastructure such as expanded battery assembly facilities and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model s and model x 

in particular we have only recently begun to accept customer reservation payments on our model x crossover can provide no assurance that customers will be willing to make such payments and accordingly may be reliant on other financing sources to fund the development of this vehicle we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially adversely affected additionally under our doe loan facility we face restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and in the future may need to obtain a waiver from the doe in order to do so we may not be able to obtain such waiver from the doe which may harm our business future issuance of equity or equityrelated securities will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and our issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of our company 

  

we have very limited experience servicing our vehicles and we are using a different service model from the one typically used in the industry if we are unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected in addition we anticipate the level and quality of the service we provide our tesla roadster customers will have a direct impact on the success of model s and our future vehicles if we are unable to satisfactorily service our tesla roadster customers our ability to generate customer loyalty grow our business and sell additional tesla roadsters as well as model s sedans could be impaired 

we have very limited experience servicing our vehicles we do not plan to begin production of any model s vehicles until mid2012 with higher volume production not occurring until 2013 and do not have any experience servicing these cars as they do not exist currently servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills including high voltage training and servicing techniques 

we plan to service our performance electric vehicles through our companyowned tesla service centers and through our mobile service technicians known as the tesla rangers many of our tesla stores are equipped to actively service our performance electric vehicles however our new design stores do not have servicing capabilities certain stores have been open for less than one year and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles through our tesla stores going forward we intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets but to date have limited experience with separate sales and service locations within a geographic market we will need to open additional tesla stores with service capabilities and standalone service locations as well as hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these centers and act as tesla rangers in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles we only implemented our tesla rangers program in october 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers’ vehicles there can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirement in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases 

we do not expect to be able to open tesla stores in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside in order to address the service needs of customers that are not in geographical proximity to our service centers we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile tesla rangers to service the vehicles at the customer’s location these special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers in addition a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network if we do not adequately address our customers’ service needs our brand and reputation will be adversely affected which in turn could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

traditional automobile manufacturers in the united states do not provide maintenance and repair services directly consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers we do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles at this point we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future as our vehicles are placed in more locations we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales thereby harming our business and prospects 

  

in addition the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain while we believe our tesla ranger program and our practice of shipping customers’ vehicles to our nearest tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in these circumstances without seeking formal regulatory guidance there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states further certain state franchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service if issues arise in connection with these laws certain aspects of tesla’s service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law which may harm our business 

we may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the tesla brand which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business revenues and prospects 

our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand any failure to develop maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the tesla roadster model s model x and future planned electric vehicles and sell our electric powertrain components if we do not continue to establish maintain and strengthen our brand we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and repair services and we have very limited experience in these areas any problems associated with the launch of our model s sedan may hurt the tesla brand 

in addition we expect that our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts to date we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand to further promote our brand we may be required to change our marketing practices which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses including the need to use traditional media such as television radio and print the automobile industry is intensely competitive and we may not be successful in building maintaining and strengthening our brand many of our current and potential competitors particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in detroit japan and the european union have greater name recognition broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do if we do not develop and maintain a strong brand our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

our recent agreement with toyota contains risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 

in july 2011 we entered into a supply and services agreement with toyota for the supply of a validated electric powertrain system including a battery pack charging system inverter motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to this agreement we expect that toyota will pay us approximately 100 million between 2012 and 2014 based on our delivery of electric powertrain systems the payments to us are not guaranteed and will only occur upon the delivery of powertrain systems that meet toyota’s specifications toyota has no obligation to buy any systems from us and if toyota does not order the anticipated systems from us we will not receive the revenues we anticipate from this agreement the agreement further requires that we meet customary obligations such as timely deliveries warranty and product defect obligations our failure to meet these obligations could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 

additionally although we have discussed new business opportunities with toyota there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach agreement with toyota regarding such opportunities at all or on terms and conditions that are favorable to us 

  

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems if these implementations are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems to assist us in the management of our business in particular our production of model s will necessitate the improvement design and development of more expanded supply chain systems to support our operations as well as production and shop floor management additionally we will need to continually build out and improve upon our online customer interface systems as well as enhance the integration of our software systems used to share data between engineering supply chain and manufacturing in order to be able to efficiently mass produce model s the implementation of new software management platforms and the addition of these platforms at new locations require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems including supply chain disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain supplies when needed or to deliver vehicles to our tesla stores and customers we cannot be sure that these expanded systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis if at all if we do not successfully implement this project our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed in addition the new systems may not operate as we expect them to and we may be required to expend significant resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

if our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products the vehicle may not operate properly which could harm our business 

automobile enthusiasts may seek to “hack” our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems also we are aware of customers who have customized their vehicles with aftermarket parts that may compromise driver safety for example some customers have installed seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised other customers have changed wheels and tires while others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle we have not tested nor do we endorse such changes or products in addition customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customers to injury from high voltage electricity such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

the success of our business depends on attracting and retaining a large number of customers if we are unable to do so we will not be able to achieve profitability 

our success depends on attracting a large number of potential customers to purchase our electric vehicles as of december 31 2011 we had accepted reservations for over 8000 model s sedans if our existing and prospective customers do not perceive our vehicles and services to be of sufficiently high value and quality cost competitive and appealing in aesthetics or performance or if the final production version of model s is not sufficiently similar to the drivable design prototype we may not be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers investors may lose confidence in us and our business and prospects operating results and financial condition may suffer as a result in addition because our performance electric vehicles to date have been sold largely through word of mouth marketing efforts we may be required to incur significantly higher and more sustained advertising and promotional expenditures than we have previously incurred to attract customers and use more traditional advertising techniques in addition if we engage in traditional advertising we may face review by consumer protection enforcement agencies and may incur significant expenses to ensure that our advertising claims are fully supported to date we have limited experience selling our electric vehicles and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining a large number of customers for example a significant number of our stores have been open for less than one year and a portion of our sales team come from backgrounds other than automotive if for any of these reasons we are not able to attract and maintain customers our business prospects operating results and financial condition would be materially harmed 

  

regulators could review our practice of taking reservation payments and if the practice is deemed to violate applicable law we could be required to pay penalties or refund the reservation payments that we have received for vehicles that are not immediately available for delivery to stop accepting additional reservation payments to restructure certain aspects of our reservation program and potentially to suspend or revoke our licenses to manufacture and sell our vehicles 

we have not yet commenced production of our model s sedan which we currently plan for mid2012 we have also not commenced production of our model x crossover which we currently plan to do in late 2013 and ramp up to significant customer deliveries in early 2014 for customers interested in making a reservation for model s or model x we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least 5000 as of december 31 2011 we had collected reservation payments for model s sedans in an aggregate amount of 900 million we started taking reservations for model x in february 2012 at this time we do not plan to hold reservation payments separately or in an escrow or trust fund or pay any interest on reservation payments except to the extent applicable state laws require us to do so we generally use these funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

california laws and potentially the laws of other states restrict the ability of licensed auto dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before the vehicles are available to the dealer from the manufacturer in november 2007 we became aware that the new motor vehicle board of the california department of transportation has considered whether our reservation policies and advertising comply with the california vehicle code to date we have not received any communications on this topic from the new motor vehicle board or the department of motor vehicles dmv which has the power to enforce these laws there can be no assurance that the dmv will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law we expect that if the dmv determines that we may have violated the law it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance if we are ultimately found to be in violation of california law we might be precluded from taking reservation payments and the dmv could take other actions against us including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program in addition california is currently the only jurisdiction in which we have licenses to both manufacture and sell our vehicles so any limitation imposed on our operations in california may be particularly damaging to our business the dmv also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in california following a hearing on the merits which it has typically exercised in cases of significant or repeat violations andor a refusal to comply with dmv directions 

certain states may have specific laws which apply to reservation payments accepted by dealers or manufacturers selling directly to consumers or both for example the state of washington requires that reservation payments or other payments received from residents in the state of washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer consequently we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of washington in january 2010 there can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payments received from customers our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity 

furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time if our vehicle reservation or advertising practices or other business practices were found to violate the laws of a jurisdiction we may face exposure under those laws and our business and prospects would be adversely affected for example if we are required to return reservation payment amounts we may need to raise additional funds to make such payments there can be no assurance that such funding would be available on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms if at all if a court were to 

  

find that our reservation agreement or advertising does not comply with state laws we may face exposure under those laws which may include exposure under consumer protection statutes such as those that deal with unfair competition and false advertising moreover reductions in our cash as a result of redemptions or an inability to take reservation payments could also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing the prospect of reductions in cash even if unrealized may also make it more difficult to obtain financing 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles in addition we may not be able to open stores in certain states 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles this planned global expansion of tesla stores may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore there can be no assurances that we will be able to construct additional storefronts on the budget or timeline we have established we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale of our vehicles in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delays in expanding our network of tesla stores this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have opened tesla stores in major metropolitan areas throughout north america europe and asia we plan to open additional stores with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection with the model s rollout however we may not be able to expand our network at such rate and our planned expansion of our network of tesla stores will require significant cash investment and management resources as well as efficiency in the execution of establishing these storefronts and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell our vehicles 

furthermore certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that may preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sales in such jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects and operating results 

we face risks associated with our international operations including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions which could harm our business 

we face risks associated with our international operations including possible unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions which could harm our business we currently have international operations and subsidiaries in australia canada denmark france germany hong kong italy japan monaco netherlands norway singapore switzerland and the united kingdom that are subject to the legal political regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions additionally as part of our growth strategy we intend to expand our sales maintenance and repair services internationally however we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles internationally and such expansion would require us to make significant expenditures including the hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to successfully address these risks our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 

foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar could harm our financial results 

our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched for example a portion of our costs and expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 was denominated in foreign currencies principally the british pound this is primarily due to the contract with lotus in the united kingdom to assemble the tesla roadster vehicles and gliders if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against the british pound our costs as measured in us dollars will correspondingly increase similarly a weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen or another asian currency could cause our component costs to increase however we do not currently have sufficient revenues denominated in these currencies to fully offset the impact of such cost increases as a result our operating results could be adversely affected conversely we have greater revenues than costs denominated in other currencies principally the euro in this case a strengthening of the dollar against the euro from current levels would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in us dollars 

the unavailability reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

any reduction elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular this could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative fuel vehicles generally and performance electric vehicles specifically for example in december 2009 we finalized an arrangement with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority that will result in an exemption from california state sales and use taxes for up to 320 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales and use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately 31 million over a three year period starting in december 2009 this exemption is only available for equipment that would otherwise be subject to california sales and use taxes and that would be used only for the following three purposes to establish our production facility for the model s sedan to upgrade our palo alto powertrain production facility and to expand our current tesla roadster assembly operations at our menlo park facility if we fail to meet these conditions we would be unable to take full advantage of this tax incentive and our financial position could be harmed 

  

in addition certain regulations and laws that encourage sales of electric cars through tax credits or other subsidies could be reduced eliminated or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect against our vehicles either currently or at any time in the future for example while the federal and state governments have from time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel cars our competitors have more experience and greater resources in working with legislators than we do and so there is no guarantee that our vehicles would be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to alternative fuel vehicles in the future this would put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage as an example at the state level california recently renewed a rebate program for the purchase of qualified alternative technology vehicles but reduced the rebate amount from 5000 per vehicle to 2500 per vehicle due to fewer funds available and increased demand when these funds run out there is no mechanism in place to replenish them until the next fiscal year subsequent purchasers would face a delay in receiving rebates since they would have to wait until the next fiscal year’s funding became available as an additional example there is considerable discussion at the federal level over tax reform discussions have included reducing or even eliminating the current 7500 tax credit available to purchasers of qualified alternative fuel vehicles including the tesla roadster and model s also government disincentives have been enacted in europe for gaspowered vehicles which discourage the use of such vehicles and allow us to set a higher sales price for the tesla roadster in europe in the event that such disincentives are reduced or eliminated sales of electric vehicles including our tesla roadster and our model s could be adversely affected furthermore low volume manufacturers are exempt from certain regulatory requirements in the united states and the european union this provides us with an advantage over high volume manufacturers that must comply with such regulations once we reach a certain threshold number of sales in each of the united states and the european union we will no longer be able to take advantage of such exemptions in the respective jurisdictions which could lead us to incur additional design and manufacturing expense we do not anticipate that we will be able to take advantage of these exemptions with respect to model s which we plan to produce at significantly higher volumes than the tesla roadster 

if we are unable to grow our sales of electric vehicle components to original equipment manufacturers our financial results may suffer 

we may have trouble attracting and retaining powertrain customers which could adversely affect our business prospects and results daimler and its affiliates and toyota and its affiliates are currently the only customers of our electric powertrain sales and development services while we recently received a letter of intent from daimler for a full electric powertrain program for a vehicle in the mercedes line and a purchase order to begin this development there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure future business with daimler or its affiliates even if we can attract and retain powertrain customers there is no assurance that we can adequately pursue such opportunities simultaneously with the execution of our plans for our vehicles 

our relationship with daimler is subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects 

while we recently received a letter of intent from daimler for a full electric powertrain program for a vehicle in the mercedes line and a purchase order to begin this development our relationship with daimler poses various risks to us including 

 

  

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

  

in addition our exclusivity and intellectual property agreement or eip agreement with daimler north america corporation dnac an affiliate of daimler provides that if a daimler competitor offers to enter into a competitive strategic transaction with us we are required to give dnac notice of such offer and dnac will have a specified period of time in which to notify us whether it wishes to enter into such transaction with us on the same terms as offered by the third party because we will be able to enter into such a transaction with a third party only if dnac declines to do so this may decrease the likelihood that we will receive offers from third parties to enter into strategic arrangements in the future 

we may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities or form strategic relationships in the future 

strategic business relationships will be an important factor in the growth and success of our business for example our strategic relationship with daimler has provided us with various benefits and we have entered into an agreement for the supply of a validated electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with toyota however there are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationship opportunities in the future or our competitors may capitalize on such opportunities before we do our strategic relationship with daimler involved blackstar an affiliate of daimler making a significant equity investment in us as well as a representative from daimler dr herbert kohler joining our board in addition toyota made a significant equity investment in us concurrent with the closing of our ipo in july 2010 we may not be able to offer similar benefits to other companies that we would like to establish and maintain strategic relationships with which could impair our ability to establish such relationships moreover identifying such opportunities could demand substantial management time and resources and negotiating and financing relationships involves significant costs and uncertainties if we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic relationship opportunities in the future our overall growth could be impaired and our business prospects and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology we may suffer a decline in our competitive position 

we may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and as a result may suffer a decline in our competitive position any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology as technologies change we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology in particular battery cell technology however our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles for example we do not manufacture battery cells which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs 

if we fail to manage future growth effectively we may not be able to market and sell our vehicles successfully 

any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we continue to expand our operations significantly and additional significant expansion will be required especially in connection with the establishment of our model s manufacturing facility our electric powertrain manufacturing facility the expansion of our network of tesla stores and service centers our mobile tesla rangers program and requirements of being a public company our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully risks that we face in undertaking this expansion include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 we intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel including design and manufacturing personnel and service technicians for our performance electric vehicles because our highperformance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines individuals with sufficient training in performance electric vehicles may not be available to hire and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire competition for individuals with experience designing manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense and we may not be able to attract assimilate train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future the failure to attract integrate train motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business and prospects 

if we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified management technical vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel our ability to compete could be harmed and our stock price may decline 

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results as well as cause our stock price to decline in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of directors and jb straubel our chief technical officer none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team as well as technical vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive experience in addition we do not have “key person” life insurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones in particular as we prepare for the launch of model s we will have to significantly ramp up hiring of manufacturing personnel and finding manufacturing personnel in sufficient numbers at the required times and with the needed skill sets may be difficult 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman of our board of directors and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and chairman of solarcity a solar equipment installation company 

in addition our financing agreements with blackstar contain certain covenants relating to mr musk’s employment as our chief executive officer these covenants provide that if mr musk is not serving as our chief executive officer at any time until the later of december 31 2012 or the launch of model s mr musk shall promptly propose a successor chief executive officer and dr kohler or his successor must consent to any 

  

appointment of such person by our board of directors if at any time during the period from january 1 2011 through december 31 2012 mr musk is not serving as either our chief executive officer or chairman of our board of directors for reasons other than his death or disability and dr kohler or his successor has not consented to the appointment of a new chief executive officer or if during such period mr musk renders services to or invests in any other automotive oem other than us daimler has the right to terminate any or all of its strategic collaboration agreements with us if this were to occur our business would be harmed 

furthermore our doe loan facility provides that we will be in default under the facility in the event mr musk and certain of his affiliates fail to own at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to model s at least 65 of the capital stock held by mr musk and such affiliates as of the date of the doe loan facility mr musk’s shares of our capital stock are held directly by his personal trust 

many members of our management team are new to the company or to the automobile industry and execution of our business plan and development strategy could be seriously harmed if integration of our management team into our company is not successful 

our business could be seriously harmed if integration of our management team into our company is not successful we expect that it will take time for our new management team to integrate into our company and it is too early to predict whether this integration will be successful we have recently experienced significant changes in our management team and expect to continue to experience significant growth in our management team our senior management team has only limited experience working together as a group specifically three of the six members of our senior management team have joined us within the last few years for example gilbert passin our vice president of manufacturing joined us in january 2010 george blankenship our vice president of sales and ownership experience joined us in july 2010 and eric whitaker our general counsel joined us in october 2010 this lack of longterm experience working together may impact the team’s ability to collectively quickly and efficiently respond to problems and effectively manage our business although we are taking steps to add senior management personnel that have significant automotive experience many of the members of our current senior management team have limited or no prior experience in the automobile or electric vehicle industries 

we are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building our manufacturing facilities 

as an automobile manufacturer we and our operations both in the united states and abroad are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business these laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs cleanup costs property damage bodily injury and fines and penalties capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations can be significant and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties third party damages suspension of production or a cessation of our operations 

contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by us as well as at properties we will own and operate and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations including but not limited to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla which can impose liability for the full amount of remediationrelated costs without regard to fault for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or 

  

operating results we may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and delay our ability to operate these facilities which would adversely impact our business prospects and operating results 

new united motor manufacturing inc nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at our tesla factory which affect soil and groundwater and has undertaken efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues at the fremont site we cannot currently determine with certainty the total potential costs to remediate preexisting contamination and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of any environmental contamination at the fremont site 

as the owner of the fremont site we may be responsible under federal and state laws and regulations for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the fremont site whether it occurred before or after the date we purchase the property we have reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions remediation activities and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing 

on the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on the remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability including attorney fees or any costs or penalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental conditions and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement as of december 31 2011 we have accrued 53 million related to these environmental liabilities 

there are no assurances that nummi will perform its obligations under our agreement and nummi’s failure to perform would require us to undertake these obligations at a potentially significant cost and risk to our ability to build equip and operate our tesla factory any remediation activities or other environmental conditions at the fremont site could harm our operations and the future use and value of the fremont site and could delay our production plans for model s 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities 

although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages our employees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory we recently purchased an existing automobile production facility in fremont california from nummi and we plan to produce our model s at such facility prior employees of nummi were union members and our future work force at this facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union we are also directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition the mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our reputation in the eyes of some investors and thereby negatively affect our stock price additionally the unionization of our labor force 

  

could increase our employee costs and decrease our profitability both of which could adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to substantial regulation which is evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results 

our performance electric vehicles the sale of motor vehicles in general and the electronic components used in our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we have incurred and expect to incur in the future significant costs in complying with these regulations for example the clean air act requires that we obtain a certificate of conformity issued by the epa and a california executive order issued by the carb with respect to emissions for our vehicles we received a certificate of conformity for sales of our tesla roadsters in 2008 and 2010 but did not receive a certificate of conformity for sales of the tesla roadster in 2009 until december 21 2009 in january 2010 we and the epa entered into an administrative settlement agreement and audit policy determination in which we agreed to pay a civil administrative penalty in the sum of 275000 for failing to obtain a certificate of conformity for sales of our vehicles in 2009 prior to december 21 2009 

regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition as the automotive industry moves towards greater use of electronics for vehicle systems nhtsa and other regulatory bodies may in the future increase regulation for these electronic systems 

to the extent the laws change some or all of our vehicles may not comply with applicable international federal state or local laws which would have an adverse effect on our business compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome time consuming and expensive to the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 

  

we retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws 

we use our vehicles’ electronic systems to log information about each vehicle’s use in order to aid us in vehicle diagnostics repair and maintenance as well as to help us collect data regarding our customers’ charge time battery usage mileage and efficiency habits our customers may object to the use of this data which may harm our business possession and use of our customers’ personal information in conducting our business may subject us to federal andor state legislative and regulatory burdens in the united states and foreign jurisdictions that could require notification of data breach restrict our use of such personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers for example we are subject to local data protection laws in europe we may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy consumer protection and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers we may be required to expend significant resources to resolve these problems a major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles a successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results we self insure against the risk of product liability claims any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and financial condition we may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy 

in connection with the development and sale of our model s model x and our future electric vehicles we will need to comply with various additional safety regulations and requirements that were not applicable to the sales of our tesla roadsters with which it may be expensive or difficult to comply for example we will need to pass a range of impact tests for model s we performed similar tests on the tesla roadster based on european union testing standards in connection with sales exceeding certain volume thresholds in australia and japan and two criteria were not met in the test we may experience difficulties in meeting all the criteria for these or similar tests for our model s and model x which may delay our ability to sell model s and model x in high volumes in certain jurisdictions 

we may be compelled to undertake product recalls which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance 

any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we previously experienced product recalls in may 2009 and october 2010 both of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain in april 2009 we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during manufacture of the tesla roadster glider in october 2010 we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge 

  

of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our vehicles including our model s or electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls voluntary or involuntary involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources which could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets and could adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected we provide a three year or 36000 miles new vehicle limited warranty with every tesla roadster which we extended to four years or 50000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 tesla roadster in addition customers have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36000 miles whichever comes first the new vehicle limited warranty is similar to other vehicle manufacturers’ warranty programs and is intended to cover all parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems battery pack powertrain and brake system we record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs however because we only began delivering our first tesla roadster in early 2008 we have extremely limited operating experience with our vehicles and therefore little experience with warranty claims for these vehicles or with estimating warranty reserves furthermore reserves that we anticipate recording when we commence delivering model s may be insufficient to cover any future warranty claims 

since we began initiating sales of our vehicles we have continued to increase our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim experience and we may be required to undertake further such increases in the future as of december 31 2011 we had warranty reserves of 63 million and such reserve amount will increase in the future as model s is sold we could in the future become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense there can be no assurances that our currently existing or future warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction 

we may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs 

companies organizations or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop or sell our vehicles or components which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks inquiring whether we infringe their proprietary rights companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights relating to battery packs electric motors or electronic power management systems may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise asserting their rights and seeking licenses in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to do one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

   

in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we also license patents and other intellectual property from third parties and we may face claims that our use of this inlicensed technology infringes the rights of others in that case we may seek indemnification from our licensors under our license contracts with them however our rights to indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses depending on our use of the technology whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation and other factors 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results our success depends at least in part on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of patents patent applications trade secrets including knowhow employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws trademarks intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles 

the protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities however such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 existing trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 

our patent applications may not result in issued patents which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours 

we cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions nor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor in addition patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws rules and procedures that differ from those of the united states and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued us patents will 

  

result in issued patents furthermore even if these patent applications do result in issued patents some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the united states 

the status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain as a result we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will result in patents being issued or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the near future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology in addition patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

three of our trademark applications in the european union remain subject to three outstanding opposition proceedings 

we currently sell and market our vehicles in the european union under the tesla trademark we have three trademark applications in the european union for the tesla trademark these are each subject to an outstanding opposition proceeding brought by a prior owner of trademarks consisting of the word tesla if we cannot resolve these remaining oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in the european union this will reduce our ability to challenge third party users of the tesla trademark and dilute the value of the mark as our exclusive brand name in the european union in addition there is a risk that the remaining prior rights owner could in the future take action to challenge our use of the tesla mark in the european union this would have a severe impact on our position in the european union and may inhibit our ability to use the tesla mark in the european union if we were prevented from using the tesla trademark in the european union we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets 

we may be subject to claims arising from an airplane crash in which three of our employees died 

in february 2010 three of our employees died in a crash of an airplane owned and piloted by one of our employees the plane crashed in a neighborhood in east palo alto california the plane also clipped an electrical tower causing a power loss and business interruption in parts of palo alto including stanford university the cause of the accident is under investigation by the national transportation safety board 

in november 2010 a case was filed against us relating to the crash in california superior court in that case plaintiffs allege claims for negligence negligent infliction of emotional distress trespass and violations of federal and state aviation laws and regulations against all defendants and seek compensation for real property damage and loss of use as well as personal property and emotional distressbodily injury claims in december 2010 the plaintiffs settled claims for real property damage but retained their claims for emotional distress bodily injury and personal property damage we believe that these remaining claims are covered by insurance 

as a result of the accident other claims including but not limited to those arising from loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or damage to the electrical tower and surrounding area may be asserted against various parties including us the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims and for any judgments if such claims are adversely determined 

our corporate or manufacturing facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events 

our corporate headquarters in palo alto and tesla factory in fremont are located in northern california a region known for seismic activity if major disasters such as earthquakes fires floods hurricanes wars terrorist attacks computer viruses pandemics or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously 

  

damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products in addition our lease for our palo alto facility permits the landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain thresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts we may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

if our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity 

our core values which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity are an important component of our brand image which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices we do not control our independent suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices such as environmental responsibility fair wage practices appropriate sourcing of raw materials and compliance with child labor laws among others a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations 

violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand this could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if as a result of such violation we were to attract negative publicity if we or other manufacturers in our industry encounter similar problems in the future it could harm our brand image business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting we may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and as a result the value of our common stock 

we are required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting this assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

complying with section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources we may not be able to complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion additionally if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 

as of december 31 2011 our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 417 of our outstanding shares of common stock in particular elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owned approximately 

  

289 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december 31 2011 as a result these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile 

our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on june 29 2010 and therefore the trading history for our common stock has been limited in addition the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control for example after opening at 1700 per share at the ipo our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 3642 per share and a low of 1498 per share through december 31 2011 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance these fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock during the period following this offering in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies this litigation if instituted against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

a majority of our total outstanding shares are held by insiders and may be sold on a stock exchange in the near future the large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock stockholders owning a majority of our total outstanding shares are entitled under contracts providing for registration rights to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the united states subject to the restrictions of rule 144 in addition we have registered shares previously issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and agreements a portion of which are related to outstanding option awards subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and in certain cases lockup agreements the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the united states in the open market sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate these sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock 

mr musk has borrowed funds from an affiliate of our underwriter and pledged shares of our common stock to secure this borrowing the forced sale of these shares pursuant to a margin call could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business 

goldman sachs bank usa an affiliate of goldman sachs  co made a loan in the amount of 35 million to elon musk and the elon musk revocable trust dated july 22 2003 or the trust interest on the loan accrues at market rates goldman sachs bank usa received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with this loan goldman sachs bank usa made additional extensions of credit in an aggregate amount of 50 million to elon musk and the trust and mr musk used a portion of the proceeds of such loans to purchase shares 

  

in the june 2011 private placement interest on the loans will accrue at market rates goldman sachs bank usa will receive customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans as a regulated entity goldman sachs bank usa makes decisions regarding making and managing its loans independent of goldman sachs  co mr musk and goldman have a longstanding relationship of almost a decade we are not a party to these loans which are full recourse against mr musk and the trust and are secured by a pledge of a portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk and the trust and other shares of capital stock of unrelated entities owned by mr musk and the trust the terms of these loans were negotiated directly between mr musk and goldman sachs bank usa 

if the price of our common stock declines mr musk may be forced by goldman sachs bank usa to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans the loans between goldman sachs bank usa and mr musk and the trust prohibit the nonpledged shares currently owned by mr musk and the trust from being pledged to secure other loans in addition our doe loan facility requires mr musk and certain of his affiliates until one year after we complete the project relating to the model s facility to own at least 65 of the tesla capital stock held by them as of the date of the doe loan facility and a failure to comply would be an event of default that could result in an acceleration of all obligations under the doe loan facility documents and the exercise of other remedies by the doe these factors may limit mr musk’s ability to either pledge additional shares of tesla common stock or sell shares of tesla common stock as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged tesla common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common stock to decline further 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

our current agreements with blackstar an affiliate of daimler contain certain restrictions that decrease the likelihood that potential acquirors would make a bid to acquire us 

our financing agreements with blackstar an affiliate of daimler include certain restrictions that decrease the likelihood that potential acquirors would make a bid to acquire us including giving blackstar a right of notice on any acquisition proposal we receive for which we determine to engage in further discussions with a potential acquiror or otherwise pursue blackstar then has a right within a specified time period to submit a competing acquisition proposal in addition elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman and largest stockholder has agreed that he will not transfer any shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by him to any automobile original equipment manufacturer other than daimler without blackstar’s consent mr musk has further agreed not to vote any shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by him in favor of a deemed liquidation transaction to which any automobile original equipment manufacturer other than daimler is a party without blackstar’s consent these provisions could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control of us which could cause our stock price or trading volume to fall 

if securities or industry analysts publishing research or reports about us our business or our market change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely or cease to publish research or reports about us our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us our business our market or our competitors if any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors our stock price would likely decline if any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 

we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future consequently investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview and 2011 highlights 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we own our sales and service network and market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers via the phone and internet inperson at our corporate events and through our network of tesla stores we were incorporated in delaware in july 2003 opened our first store in los angeles california in may 2008 and introduced our first vehicle the tesla roadster in early 2008 we are targeting our second vehicle the model s sedan for a significantly broader customer base than the tesla roadster and plan to manufacture model s in higher volumes than those for the tesla roadster first customer deliveries of model s are planned by july 2012 we have also recently revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover a vehicle based on the model s platform this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as a dual motor allwheel drive system 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized total revenues of 2042 million an increase of 75 over total revenues of 1167 million for the year ended december 31 2010 automotive sales revenue of 1486 million increased 53 from the year ended december 31 2010 driven by strong customer demand for the tesla roadster globally and significantly higher powertrain component sales we completed 2011 with cumulative deliveries worldwide from inception of approximately 2150 roadsters and concluded the production run of the tesla roadster in january 2012 we expect to sell our remaining tesla roadsters primarily in europe and asia during 2012 until our inventory is depleted 

development services revenue increased to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 197 million for the year ended december 31 2010 due primarily to our development activities for the toyota motor corporation toyota rav4 ev program for a full electric powertrain system we completed planned milestones and deliveries of samples to toyota during the year and we currently expect to complete our remaining development services milestones and sample deliveries during the first quarter of 2012 

we made significant progress on the model s program this year and we remain on schedule to commence customer deliveries by july 2012 during the year we moved from building alpha to beta prototypes and performed detailed testing of systems integration performance and safety our significant efforts in development and testing both of which are ongoing has allowed us to further refine the overall design of model s and its constituent parts as well as the production and assembly processes to manufacture the vehicle in october 2011 

  

we finalized a long term supply contract with panasonic corporation for battery cells to be used in our products which gives us increased visibility into our variable costs 

research and development expenses included expenses related to model s alpha and beta prototype build development of the tesla factory significant engineering design and testing work being undertaken to support model s development design and engineering activities related to model x and other research and development activities research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 were 2090 million compared to 930 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

in addition to model s engineering we also experienced significant activity at the tesla factory where we intend to produce our model s model x and future vehicles significant construction has taken place and detailed manufacturing readiness plans are being executed almost all of our model s vehicle manufacturing equipment has been installed at the tesla factory as part of our testing and qualifying activities of our manufacturing equipment we are now assembling beta prototype vehicles at the tesla factory and expect to start building release candidate vehicles in the first quarter of 2012 during this process we are continuing to finetune our production processes and incorporate a higher percentage of productionintent components into the cars once we complete these activities the tesla factory will be fully commissioned for production and ready for its intended use as a result of investments being made in the tesla factory and related supplier tooling for model s capital expenditures increased to 1979 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 1054 million for the year ended december 31 2010 our capital expenditures in 2010 were comprised primarily of payments we had made towards the purchase of the tesla factory from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi 

with the opening of our santana row store in 2011 we launched what we believe to be a new and unique retail experience designed to engage and inform potential customers about electric vehicles in general learn about tesla’s innovations and configure their cars through handson interactive screens during the year we further expanded our companyowned retail network with the opening of several more stores in the united states utilizing the new store concept embodied by our santana row tesla store some of these new stores will replace existing stores which we plan to continue using as service locations as a result of our activities to support the sales of the tesla roadster the opening and operation of new stores higher storerelated and marketing activities as well as the growth of our business in general we incurred higher selling general and administrative expenses of 1041 million for the year ended december 31 2011 when compared to expenses of 846 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

in june 2011 we completed a followon offering of common stock in which a total of 6095000 shares of our common stock were sold and received cash proceeds of 1727 million net of underwriting discounts concurrent with this offering we also sold 1416000 shares of common stock to elon musk our chief executive officer and 637475 shares of common stock to blackstar investco llc an affiliate of daimler and received total cash proceeds of 591 million in these private placements no underwriting discounts or commissions were paid in connection with these private placements 

along with the proceeds from our public offerings and private placements our continued drawdowns under the department of energy loan facility doe loan facility and other sources of cash including cash from the sales of the tesla roadster development services to toyota sales of powertrain components to daimler and cash received from refundable reservation payments for our model s provided the liquidity to fund our model s model x and powertrain development activities as well as our capital investments in manufacturing infrastructure during the year ended december 31 2011 we received 2044 million in drawdowns under the doe loan facility bringing our total longterm debt under the facility to 2763 million as we continue to progress on our model s and powertrain activities we expect to continue making drawdowns under the doe loan facility 

as of december 31 2011 we had 4927 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility this includes our cash and cash equivalents in the 

  

amount of 2553 million which includes investments in money market funds shortterm marketable securities of 251 million cash of 235 million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility and 1888 million available under the doe loan facility we expect that these principal sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity until we reach profitability in 2013 

management opportunities challenges and risks 

our principal focus has continued to be on the disciplined development of model s so that we can commence deliveries by july 2012 we have also been focused on the continued sales of the tesla roadster and powertrain components development services activities with our strategic partners advanced engineering work on the planned model x and pursuing new electric powertrain opportunities with automobile manufacturers 

in january 2012 we concluded the production run of our current generation tesla roadster through december 31 2011 we had delivered approximately 2150 roadsters to customers we plan to sell our remaining tesla roadsters during 2012 primarily in europe and asia until our inventory is depleted 

powertrain component sales in 2011 were driven primarily by our deliveries to supply daimler ag daimler with battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo and aclass ev programs we completed both of these production programs as of december 31 2011 in july 2011 we entered into a supply and services agreement with toyota for the production of an electric powertrain system including a battery pack charging system inverter motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into the toyota rav4 ev additionally we will provide toyota with certain services related to the supply of these components pursuant to the agreement toyota will pay us approximately 100 million from 2012 through 2014 based on our delivery of these components for the toyota rav4 ev due to the wind down of the daimler smart fortwo and aclass ev production programs at the end of 2011 we expect powertrain component sales to be limited until the planned start of production of the toyota rav4 ev powertrain system in the first half of 2012 

as we have a limited number of the tesla roadsters left for sale and as we expect powertrain component sales to decline until the start of production for the toyota rav4 ev program we anticipate our automotive sales will decline potentially significantly just prior to the planned launch of our model s the launch of our model s could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited revenues from sales of our electric vehicles and electric powertrain systems 

we completed all of our planned milestones and deliveries of samples to toyota during 2011 and we currently expect to complete our remaining development services milestones and sample deliveries during the first quarter of 2012 as such we expect that the remaining development services revenue under the toyota rav4 ev program will also be recognized in the first quarter since the revenue related to development services milestones are recognized when achieved while milestone costs must be expensed as incurred our development services gross margin will reflect this favorability when we recognize our final toyota rav4 ev milestones in 2012 in november 2011 we received a letter of intent from daimler for a full electric powertrain program for a vehicle in the mercedes line and recently we received a purchase order to begin the development work however we have not yet finalized with daimler the terms for this program and may never do so due to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of future milestone revenue and the underlying costs of development services the gross margin from our development services activities may vary from period to period as we have seen under our previous development services agreements including that for the toyota rav4 ev program 

the build of model s beta prototypes continues to progress and we will begin building release candidate vehicles in the first quarter of 2012 we continue to work closely with suppliers to design develop and test components that will meet our anticipated production design specifications and schedule ensuring that our design engineering operations and manufacturing engineering teams and our suppliers execute on all 

  

significant activities will be critical to a timely launch of first customer deliveries of our model s by july 2012 our continuing negotiations with suppliers and the adequate maturation of our manufacturing capabilities will influence our ability to achieve the cost per unit that we are currently projecting our plan to commence deliveries of model s by july 2012 is also dependent upon the timely availability of funds from the doe loan facility upon our finalizing the related design engineering component procurement testing build out and manufacturing plans in a timely manner and upon our ability to execute these plans within the current timeline 

in february 2012 we revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as a dual motor allwheel drive system we currently plan to start production of model x in the fourth quarter of 2013 with significant deliveries in 2014 our ability to develop and introduce the model x in this timeframe is based on our expectations of leveraging the model s platform additionally if there is a lower level of commonality between model s and model x than anticipated our future development and tooling costs may exceed expectations 

our operating expenses in 2011 have been significant as we continued to execute on the model s program and are systematically and strategically expanding our sales and service infrastructure globally to support the launch of model s as we continue to make significant investments in research and development and our infrastructure to launch model s as well as incur costs for the development of model x we expect to continue generating a net loss until we reach planned volume sales of model s in 2013 as preproduction expenses and development and prototyping costs cannot be capitalized we expect our operating expenses to continue increasing due to our ongoing activities to prepare the tesla factory for production refine model s through our engineering and testing on beta prototype and release candidate vehicles and continue the advanced engineering work on model x once we start recognizing revenue from the sales of model s our model s production costs including direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead and amortized tooling and logistics will begin to be reflected in cost of automotive sales 

capital spending for the model s program will continue into 2012 as we complete our commissioning activities of the tesla factory and as we make final payments for tooling and manufacturing equipment required for production depreciation of our capital expenditures related to the manufacturing of model s will begin with the start of model s production we anticipate that most of the capital expenditures on model s will continue to be funded by the doe loan facility until the launch of model s we also anticipate our aggregate capital expenditures for 2012 to be comparable to that in 2011 primarily focused on vehicle development and manufacturing activities for model s and model x 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition 

automotive sales 

we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of the tesla roadster including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle or zev credits we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components such as battery packs and battery chargers to other manufacturers we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sale of vehicles sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets prior to february 2010 we did not provide direct financing for the purchase of the tesla roadster although a thirdparty lender has provided financing arrangements to our customers in the united states under these arrangements we have been paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase starting in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states 

automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle options accessories and destination charges while these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale they are often part of one vehicle sale agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a standalone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items further we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items determined by reference to standalone sales of such items 

to date we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles vehicle accessories and options separately outside of any multiple element arrangements as each of these items has stand alone value to the customer revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

effective january 1 2011 we adopted amended accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after january 1 2011 the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price for fiscal 2011 and future periods when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available to date we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles vehicles accessories and options separately outside of any multiple element arrangements therefore there were no material differences between total revenue reported and pro forma total revenues that would have been reported during the year ended december 31 2011 if the transactions entered into or materially modified after january 1 2011 were subject to previous accounting guidance 

  

development services 

revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from the development of electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs chargers and sample vehicles to meet a customer’s specifications beginning in the quarter ended march 31 2010 we started entering into such contracts with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenuegenerating activity revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured where development arrangements include substantive atrisk milestones revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractuallydefined milestones amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet increased complexity to our development agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

costs of development services are expensed as incurred costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses once an agreement is finalized these costs are recorded in cost of development services 

prior to 2010 compensation from the smart fortwo ev development arrangement with daimler which is discussed below under “development compensation” was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 

development compensation 

we began receiving payments under the smart fortwo ev development arrangement with daimler in the year ended december 31 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities we deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time upon entering into the final agreement in may 2009 we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses on a straightline basis this amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement beginning in may 2009 and continuing through november 2009 payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in may 2009 were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones all amounts received under this development agreement have been recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations all development activities under this agreement were completed as of december 31 2009 

marketable securities 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we purchased marketable securities including commercial paper and corporate debt all marketable securities are designated as availableforsale and reported at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is included within stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses on the sale of availableforsale marketable securities are recorded in other expense net the cost of availableforsale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method interest dividends amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in other expense net availableforsale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase and remaining maturities of one year or less are classified as shortterm marketable securities where temporary declines in fair value exist we have the ability and the intent to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 

  

we regularly review all of our marketable securities for otherthantemporary declines in fair value the review includes but is not limited to i the consideration of the cause of the impairment ii the creditworthiness of the security issuers iii the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position and iv our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 

inventory valuation 

we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 

once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded writedowns of 18 million 10 million and 14 million in cost of automotive sales respectively 

the inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand selling prices and production costs should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change material changes to these reserves may be required further a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or powertrain component is delivered to a customer warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations and we will adjust our estimates as needed initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly the adjustments that we record may be material as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had 63 million and 54 million in warranty reserves respectively adjustments to warranty reserves are recorded in cost of automotive sales 

it is likely that as we sell additional tesla roadsters and powertrain components and as we repair or replace items under warranty we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to service work under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments further a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

valuation of stockbased awards common stock and warrants 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options granted to employees and employee stock purchase plan espp which require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of the awards is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of forfeitures 

  

the fair value of each stockbased award was estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the blackscholes optionpricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions 

 

 if in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stockbased awards is more reasonable or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for our stockbased awards could change significantly 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

the riskfree interest rate that we use is based on the united states treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life given our limited history with employee grants we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants the “simplified” method as permitted by the sec is calculated as the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the options 

our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business including the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries because we have limited trading history on our common stock when making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation we also considered the stage of development size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies our historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and 

  

forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

unadjusted error in 2009 

in june 2010 we identified an error related to the understatement in stockbased compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we granted certain stock options for which a portion of the grant was immediately vested we erroneously accounted for the expense on a straightline basis over the term of the award while expense recognition should always be at least commensurate with the number of awards vesting during the period as a result selling general and administrative expenses and net loss for the year ended december 31 2009 were understated by 27 million the error did not have an effect on the valuation of the stock options as stockbased compensation expense is a noncash item there was no impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 

to correct this error we recorded additional stockbased compensation of 24 million during the three months ended june 30 2010 we considered the impact of the error on reported operating expenses and trends in operating results and determined that the impact of the error was not material to previously reported financial information as well as those related to the three months ended june 30 2010 

common stock valuation 

upon the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 our common stock has been valued by reference to its publicly traded price prior to the ipo we historically granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock as determined at the date of grant by our board of directors because there was no public market for our common stock our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we had made different assumptions than those used the amount of our stockbased compensation expense net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different the following table summarizes by grant date the number of stock options granted since january 1 2008 through the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 and the associated per share exercise price which equaled the fair value of our common stock for each of these grants 

 

 included in the december 4 2009 awards were 6711972 stock options granted to our chief executive officer comprised of two grants in recognition of his and our company’s achievements and to create incentives for future success the board of directors approved an option grant representing 4 of our fullydiluted share base prior to such grant as of december 4 2009 or 3355986 stock options with 14th of the shares vesting immediately and 136th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest each month over three years assuming continued employment through each vesting date in addition to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan—the successful launch and commercialization of model s—the board of directors approved additional options totaling an additional 4 of our fullydiluted shares prior to such grant as of december 4 2009 with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance objectives as follows assuming mr musk’s continued service to us through each vesting date 

 

  

  

  

 if mr musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the grant 

included in our june and september 2010 stock option grants were 666300 and 20000 stock options granted respectively to various members of our senior management with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the same performance objectives as those outlined for mr musk above 

  

prior to our ipo which was completed on july 2 2010 our board of directors performed valuations of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid valuation of privatelyheldcompany equity securities issued as compensation  the enterprise value input of our common stock valuations were derived either using fundamental analysis income and market approaches or based on a recent round of financing option pricing approach the income approach estimates the enterprise value of the company by discounting the expected future cash flows of the company to present value we have applied discount rates that reflect the risks associated with our cash flow projections and have used venture capital rates of return for companies at a similar stage of development as us as a proxy for our cost of capital our discounted cash flow calculations are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make at each valuation date relating to appropriate discount rates for various components of our business for example the discount rates used to value the cash flow projections from the model s business factored in the low cost debt we expected to raise from the us department of energy 

 

 our projected cash flows were primarily derived from our tesla roadster model s and powertrain revenue streams in more recent valuations these cash flow projections took into account the fact that we had been selling the tesla roadster since 2008 that we began selling powertrain components in the quarter ended december 31 2009 and our anticipation of model s production in mid2012 

under the market approach the total enterprise value of the company was estimated by comparing our business to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in public markets or businesses that are involved in a public or private transaction prior transactions in our stock were also considered as part of the market approach methodology we selected revenue valuation multiples derived from trading multiples of public companies that participate in the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries these valuation multiples were then applied to the equivalent financial metric of our business giving consideration to differences between our company and similar companies for such factors as company size and growth prospects 

for those reports that relied on the fundamental analysis we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the enterprise value for both the market approach and the income approach the financial forecasts took into account our past experience and future expectations the risks associated with achieving these forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate as discussed below there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates second we allocated the resulting equity value among the securities that comprise our capital structure using the optionpricing method the aggregate value of the common stock derived from the optionpricing method was then divided by the number of common shares outstanding to arrive at the per common share value for those reports before our ipo that relied on the recent round of financing we backsolved for the total equity value such that the value of the instrument sold in the recent round as calculated by the option pricing model was consistent with the observed transaction price 

  

our board of directors considered the valuations derived from the approaches above the probability and timing of completing an ipo as of those dates as well as other qualitative factors in arriving at our common stock valuations including the following 

 

  

  

  

 our common stock valuations have required the significant use of estimates and assumptions if different estimates and assumptions had been used our common stock valuations could have been significantly different and related stockbased compensation expense may be materially impacted 

warrants 

we have accounted for our freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities at fair value upon issuance we have recorded the warrants as a liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock are contingently redeemable and therefore may obligate us to transfer assets at some point in the future the warrants are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations 

in january 2010 we issued a warrant to the doe in connection with the closing of the doe loan facility to purchase shares of our series e convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of 251 per share this convertible preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 754 per share upon the closing of our ipo in july 2010 beginning on december 15 2018 and until december 14 2022 the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the doe loan facility during the prior quarter the warrant may be exercised until december 15 2023 if we prepay the doe loan facility in part or in full the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense net until its expiration or vesting our ability to prepay the doe loan facility and consequently the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrant was determined to represent an embedded derivative this embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant 

since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrants will vary depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates we measured the fair value of the doe warrant using a monte carlo simulation approach the monte carlo approach simulates various scenarios and captures the optimal decisions to be made between prepaying the doe loan and the cancellation of the doe warrant over the expected term of the doe loan facility of 13 years for the purposes of the simulation the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us the total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation date 

the significant assumptions that we use in the valuation of the doe warrant include similar assumptions used in the valuation of otherwise featureless stock warrants at various simulated stock prices as well as the interest rate differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates for companies comparable to us the estimated value of our stock warrant requires us to use a blackscholes 

  

optionpricing model which incorporates several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stockbased compensation discussed above the differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates is derived from the credit spread data of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business as the average simulated value of our stock warrant increases relative to the credit spread of our comparator companies the fair value of our doe warrant decreases since the economic cost of prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt would be lower than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants similarly as the credit spread of our comparator companies increases relative to the average simulated value of our stock warrant the fair value of our doe warrant increases since the economic cost associated with prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt is higher than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants and therefore we would not prepay our outstanding doe debt and we would allow a higher number of warrants to vest prior to completion of our ipo the fair value of the doe warrant was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet upon the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 this warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from convertible preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability the doe warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in other expense net as the number of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or vesting the relative movements in our stock price as compared to the credit spread of our comparator companies will result in fair value changes being recorded in other expense net in future periods which may be significant 

excluding the warrant issued to the doe in january 2010 we have estimated the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a blackscholes optionpricing model which used several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stockbased compensation as discussed above upon the completion of our ipo in july 2010 these convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding as of june 30 2010 were net exercised and the related convertible preferred stock warrant liability was settled 

income taxes 

we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans as of december 31 2011 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 

  

which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update which revises the manner in which companies present comprehensive income in their financial statements the new guidance removes the presentation options and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either 1 a continuous statement of comprehensive income or 2 two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb further amended its guidance to defer changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments indefinitely the guidance other than the portion regarding the presentation of reclassification adjustments which as noted above has been deferred indefinitely is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption is permitted we anticipate adopting the guidance in fiscal 2012 we do not expect the adoption of the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level i and level ii fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers in addition in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using level iii inputs a reporting entity will be required to disclose information about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross rather than on a net basis the updated guidance will also require fair value disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring level ii and level iii fair value measurements the adoption of this updated guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods presented in thousands except per share data 

 

 revenues 

automotive sales 

automotive sales which include vehicle options and related sales and powertrain component and related sales consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

 

 automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 1486 million an increase from 971 million for the year ended december 31 2010 vehicle options and related sales represent sales of the tesla roadster including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle credits powertrain component and related sales represent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components such as battery packs and battery chargers to other manufacturers 

vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 1017 million an increase from 755 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in vehicle options and related sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of tesla roadsters that we sold particularly in north america 

  

and asia coupled with slightly higher average selling prices under our supply agreement with lotus we have built 2500 roadster gliders we plan to sell our remaining tesla roadsters primarily in europe and asia during 2012 until our inventory is depleted 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the term of the individual leases lease revenues are recorded in vehicle options and related sales within automotive sales revenue and for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we recognized 30 million and 08 million respectively during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 approximately 6 and 14 of the vehicles delivered during those years were under operating leases as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had deferred revenues of 08 million and 11 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases respectively 

powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 469 million an increase from 216 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in powertrain component and related sales was primarily due to significant shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler we began delivering battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo ev program at the end of 2009 and for the daimler aclass ev program late in the fourth quarter of 2010 production for both the smart fortwo and aclass ev programs was completed as of december 31 2011 

automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 971 million a decrease from 1119 million for the year ended december 31 2009 vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 755 million a decrease from 1115 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

during the first three quarters of 2009 we continued to fulfill reservations for the tesla roadster and we had made a significant effort to increase our production capacity in order to accelerate deliveries to customers who had been on our waitlist for a significant amount of time as a result a significant portion of the revenue recognized during the first three quarters of 2009 came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009 beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009 sales of the tesla roadster began more closely approximating the level of orders placed during the quarter consequently the comparison of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 versus the year ended december 31 2009 may not be meaningful similarly zev credit sales which are included in vehicle options and related sales were higher during the year ended december 31 2009 as the fulfillment of a significant number of reservations allowed us to sell a larger number of zev credits the year over year decrease in vehicle deliveries was partially offset by higher selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher average selling prices outside of the united states 

powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 216 million compared to 04 million for the year ended december 31 2009 during the year ended december 31 2009 we were selected by daimler to supply it with battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo ev program in a least five european cities we began delivering and recognizing revenue for these production battery packs and chargers at the end of 2009 

prior to 2010 most of our revenues had been generated through sales of our vehicles in the united states and we had no revenues from sales outside of the united states prior to the third quarter of 2009 our international sales commenced with the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july 2009 and since then we have recognized revenue from sales of the tesla roadster in additional countries including canada japan and hong kong for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 49 55 and 19 of our revenue from vehicle options and related sales respectively were derived outside of the united states for the same periods all of our powertrain component and related sales were derived outside of the united states 

  

development services 

development services represent arrangements where we develop electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs and chargers to meet customer’s specifications 

development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 was 557 million an increase from 197 million for the year ended december 31 2010 beginning in the first quarter of 2010 we started entering into development services arrangements with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenuegenerating activity we began recognizing development services revenue during the first quarter of 2010 with the development and delivery of modular battery packs for freightliner custom chassis corporation freightliner an affiliate of daimler these battery packs were to be used in electric delivery vans in a limited number of freightliner’s customer trials prior to 2010 compensation that we had received from our first development arrangement with daimler for battery packs and chargers for its smart fortwo ev program was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 

during the first quarter of 2010 daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 we began providing development services for this program during the first quarter of 2010 and had received an aggregate of 55 million in payments however as we had not executed a final agreement related to this program as of march 31 2010 we deferred the 55 million of payments that had been received from daimler to that point in may 2010 we executed a final agreement under which daimler would make additional payments to us for the successful completion of certain development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples as of december 31 2010 we had completed our deliverables under this agreement and for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized 144 million in development services revenue 

in july 2010 we entered into an agreement with toyota to initiate development of an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 ev under this phase 0 development agreement prototypes would be made by us by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain through june 30 2011 we had completed all prototype vehicles under the phase 0 agreement and for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we recognized 76 million and 13 million in development service revenue respectively 

in october 2010 we also entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery pack power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to this agreement toyota would pay us up to 600 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance including a 50 million upfront payment that we received upon the execution of the agreement during the year ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we completed various milestones and delivered samples under the phase 1 agreement including the amortization of our upfront payment for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we recognized 474 million and 33 million in development services revenue respectively under the phase 1 agreement we expect that the phase 1 agreement and the associated development services revenues will be completed by early 2012 

we intend to grow our development services revenue over time by establishing additional commercial arrangements with other automobile manufacturers and by looking for new development opportunities with existing strategic partners 

additionally we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of our delivery of milestones and samples as well as the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria 

  

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 was 1426 million an increase from 860 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in cost of automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in the number of vehicles that we sold and the increased shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler we began delivering battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo ev program at the end of 2009 and for the daimler aclass ev program at the end of 2010 cost of development services includes engineering support and testing direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements the increase in cost of development services was driven primarily by our activities for the toyota rav4 ev program which began in the second half of 2010 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2011 was 616 million an increase from 307 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was driven primarily by higher sales of the tesla roadster coupled with higher average selling prices and ongoing cost improvement program on the roadster increased shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler as well as gross profit from our development services activities which we expanded in the latter half of 2010 with the toyota rav4 ev program 

cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 was 860 million a decrease from 1024 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the decrease in cost of revenues was driven primarily by the significant number of vehicles delivered during the first three quarters of 2009 from fulfilling customer reservations placed prior to 2009 the decrease in cost of revenues from automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2010 was partially offset by the increase in cost of revenues from our development services activities 

cost of development services includes engineering support and testing direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements during the quarter ended march 31 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 as of march 31 2010 a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such the related development services costs of 05 million that we incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2010 were expensed in research and development in may 2010 we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs related to this program in cost of revenues 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 was 307 million an increase from 95 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was driven primarily by the gross profit contributed by our development services revenues which we began to recognize in 2010 an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers the continued launch of the tesla roadster internationally where in certain markets we have experienced higher selling prices and cost improvements associated with the model changeover from the tesla roadster to the tesla roadster 2 during the second half of 2009 gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 was also favorably impacted by the fact that certain of the aclass development services revenue that we recognized during the year ended december 31 2010 did not have any corresponding cost of revenues since these costs were recorded in research and development expenses prior to us finalizing the development agreement in may 2010 

we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria this may cause our gross profit and gross margin to be similarly impacted 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping 

  

expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense overhead costs related to the tesla factory prior to the start of production of model s are also included in research and development expenses also included in research and development expenses are development services costs that we incur if any prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 

research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 were 2090 million an increase from 930 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 1160 million increase in research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2011 consisted primarily of a 381 million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s alpha and beta builds overhead costs related to the tesla factory powertrain development activities a 309 million increase in costs related to model s and model x engineering design and testing activities incurred by our suppliers a 304 million increase in employee compensation expenses from higher headcount a 97 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants and a 70 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business 

research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 930 million an increase from 193 million for the year ended december 31 2009 research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 included 232 million in daimler smart fortwo ev development compensation which was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses the 737 million increase in research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 consisted primarily of a 250 million increase in employee cash and stockbased compensation expenses primarily associated with significantly higher headcount to support our model s and powertrain development activities the 232 million daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 a 105 million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s alpha build as well as powertrain development activities a 107 million increase in professional and outside services costs related to model s engineering design and testing activities and a 16 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business including our transition to our palo alto headquarters 

during the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 as of march 31 2010 a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such the related development services costs of 05 million that we incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2010 were expensed in research and development in may 2010 we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs associated with this program in cost of revenues 

we have significantly increased our research and development efforts for model s which has resulted in an increase in our research and development expenses we anticipate that our research and development expenses will rise moderately as we incur additional costs to further develop model s to develop model x and to operate our tesla factory in fremont california prior to the start of model s production 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 were 1041 million an increase from 846 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 195 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2011 consisted primarily of a 

  

123 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 41 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business a 24 million increase in professional and outside services costs and a 17 million increase in costs principally related to our tesla store and gallery openings the increase is also attributable to a 10 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants the increase for the year ended december 31 2011 was partially offset by an additional stockbased compensation charge of 24 million recognized during the year ended december 31 2010 which reflected a correction of stockbased compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 846 million an increase from 422 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 424 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 consisted primarily of a 158 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards expense related to performancebased awards an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants made in 2010 and an additional stockbased compensation charge of 24 million which reflected a correction of stockbased compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 a 134 million increase in employee cash compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support a larger number of stores in the united states and europe and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 71 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business including the opening of new stores and service locations and our transition to our palo alto headquarters a 32 million increase in travel and expenses related to our sales and marketing activities and a 10 million increase in professional services costs related to ongoing trademark and patent work recruiting as well as general corporate development activities 

we expect selling general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to grow and expand our operations increase our sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and prepare for the planned model s commercial launch by july 2012 and as we support the requirements of being a public company we plan to open additional stores and service centers during 2012 mostly in the united states and some of these stores will replace existing stores which we may continue to use as service locations 

interest expense 

our interest expense is primarily due to our loans under the doe loan facility which we began accessing in 2010 although interest expense will increase as we continue to draw down on the doe loan facility to fund our model s and powertrain activities we expect to capitalize this interest to construction in progress until the start of model s production during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we capitalized 51 million and 08 million respectively of interest expense to construction in progress 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was 10 million a decrease from 25 million for the year ended december 31 2009 interest expense during the year ended december 31 2009 was primarily related to our convertible notes which were converted into shares of our series e convertible preferred stock in may 2009 while interest expense during the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to our loans under the doe loan facility which we began accessing in 2010 

other expense net 

other expense net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our warrant liabilities and transaction gains and losses on our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates income or charges resulting from 

  

the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability excluding the doe warrant liability was eliminated after july 2 2010 as these warrants were net exercised at the completion of our ipo the doe convertible preferred stock warrant which we issued in january 2010 became a common stock warrant on july 2 2010 and is carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value continuing to be reflected in other expense net until its expiration or vesting 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2011 was 26 million a decrease from other expense net of 66 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease in expense for the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to the elimination of warrant liabilities excluding the doe warrant liability upon the completion of our ipo in july 2010 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2010 was 66 million an increase in expense compared to other expense net of 14 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to the fair value changes in our warrant liabilities as well as the liability related to common stock warrants to certain of our stockholders which we issued in may 2010 both of which increased significantly in conjunction with the increase in our common stock valuation 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2011 was 05 million an increase from 02 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2010 was 02 million an increase from 26000 for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was due primarily to the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july 2009 and the ensuing increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

since inception and through the year ended december 31 2011 we had accumulated net operating losses of 6694 million and have used 4450 million of cash in operations as of december 31 2011 we had 4927 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility this includes our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 2553 million which included investments in money market funds our shortterm marketable securities in the amount of 251 million cash of 235 million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility and approximately 1888 million available under the doe loan facility which is primarily intended to cover spending related to the development of model s and our powertrain activities other sources of cash also include cash from the sales of the tesla roadster cash from the provision of development services sales of powertrain components and refundable reservation payments for our model s 

we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility together with our anticipated cash from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity until we reach profitability in 2013 this capital will fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects establish sales and service centers improve infrastructure such as expanded battery pack assembly facilities and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model s and to continue development of model x the acceleration of the development of future vehicles investments in new technologies increased insourcing of manufacturing capabilities investments to expand our powertrain activities or further expand our sales and service network may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit we may also choose to opportunistically raise additional funds if market conditions are favorable we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

  

doe loan facility 

on january 20 2010 we entered into a loan facility with the federal financing bank ffb and the doe pursuant to the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing atvm incentive program such loan facility including amendments thereto the doe loan facility under the doe loan facility the ffb has made available to us two multidraw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to 4650 million up to an aggregate principal amount of 1012 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to 80 of the costs eligible for funding for the powertrain engineering and the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors and electric components the powertrain facility up to an aggregate principal amount of 3639 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80 of the costs eligible for funding for the development of and to build out the manufacturing facility for our model s sedan the model s facility under the doe loan facility we are responsible for the remaining 20 of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project 

our doe loan facility drawdowns were as follows in thousands 

 

 in february 2012 we received additional loans under the doe loan facility of 144 million at interest rates ranging from 09 to 14 

we have agreed that in connection with the sale of our stock in any followon equity offering at least 50 of the net offering proceeds will be received by us offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers directors employees or consultants in excess of the amounts contemplated by our business plan approved by the doe 

upon completion of our ipo in 2010 we set aside 100 million to fund a separate dedicated account under our doe loan facility this dedicated account is used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and tesla factory projects and is used as a mechanism to defer advances under the doe loan facility this will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the doe loans but will require us to use the dedicated account 

  

to fund certain project costs upfront which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the doe loan facility once the dedicated account is depleted or as part of the final advance for the applicable project we will be then required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account in an amount equal to up to 30 of the remaining project costs for the applicable project and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the drawdown of additional loans under the doe loan facility once used in full or as part of the final advance for the applicable project depending on the timing and magnitude of our drawdowns and the funding requirements of the dedicated account the balance of the dedicated account will fluctuate throughout the period in which we plan to make drawdowns under the doe loan facility upon completion of our final advance under the doe loan facility the balance in the dedicated account will be fully transferred out of the dedicated account as of december 31 2011 and 2010 235 million and 736 million were held in the dedicated account respectively 

for more information on the doe loan facility see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

initial public offering and toyota concurrent private placement 

on june 28 2010 our registration statement on form s1 relating to our ipo was declared effective by the sec the ipo closed on july 2 2010 at which time we sold 11880600 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of 1888 million from this transaction net of underwriting discounts and commissions additionally we incurred offering costs of 44 million related to the ipo 

concurrent with the closing of our ipo we sold 2941176 shares of our common stock to toyota in a private placement transaction for aggregate proceeds of 500 million 

panasonic private placement 

in november 2010 we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with an entity affiliated with panasonic corporation panasonic pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 1418573 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of 300 million 

followon offering and concurrent private placements 

in june 2011 we completed a followon offering of common stock in which we sold a total of 6095000 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of 1727 million from this transaction net of underwriting discounts 

concurrent with our followon offering we also sold 1416000 shares of our common stock to elon musk our chief executive officer and cofounder and 637475 shares of our common stock to blackstar investco llc an affiliate of daimler and received total cash proceeds of 591 million in the private placements no underwriting discounts or commissions were paid in connection with these private placements 

leasing activities 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value 

when compared to our sales of vehicles our leasing activities will spread the cash inflows that we would otherwise receive upon the sale of a vehicle over the lease term and final disposition of the leased vehicle as such our cash and working capital requirements will be directly impacted and if leasing volume increases significantly the impact may be material however after taking into consideration our current and planned sources of operating cash our ability to monitor and prospectively adjust our leasing activity as well as our intent to collect nonrefundable deposits for leased vehicles that are manufactured to specification we do not believe that our leasing operations materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments and obligations as they become due as we will also be exposed to credit risk related to the timely collection of lease payments from our customers we intend to utilize our credit approval and ongoing review processes in order to 

  

minimize any credit losses that could occur and which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we require deposits from customers electing a lease option for vehicles built to a customer’s specifications on the same timeframe and under the same circumstances as from customers purchasing our vehicles outright during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 approximately 6 and 14 of the vehicles delivered during these periods were under operating leases as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had deferred revenues of 08 million and 11 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases through december 31 2011 our leasing activity has not had a significant adverse impact on our liquidity 

reservation payments 

a source of our cash flows from operations has been through our receipt of reservation payments from our customers reservation payments consist of reservation payments that allow potential customers to hold a reservation for the future purchase of a tesla roadster model s or model x for our tesla roadsters manufactured to specification our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies based on the country of purchase for model s and model x we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least 5000 for tesla roadsters purchased directly from our showrooms no deposit is required prior to the second quarter of 2010 our reservation policy was to accept reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a tesla roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications during the second quarter of 2010 we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for tesla roadsters manufactured to specification at the time a customer enters into a purchase agreement however we also occasionally accept reservation payments for the tesla roadster if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications for customers who have placed a reservation payment with us the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement the full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle is required only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer reservation payments for a vehicle are recorded as a current liability when received no later than upon the delivery of a vehicle the reservation payments collected on a customer’s account are applied against the total purchase price of the vehicle 

summary of cash flows 

 

 cash flows from operating activities 

we continue to experience negative cash flows from operations as we expand our business and build our infrastructure both in the united states and internationally our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory personnel related expenditures accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities 

net cash used in operating activities was 1144 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of 2544 million which included noncash charges of 294 million related to stockbased compensation expense 169 million related to depreciation and amortization and 28 million related to the fair value change in our warrant liability significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 3131 million of operating expenses 1426 million of cost of revenues and a 136 million increase in inventory and operating lease vehicles partially offset by a 442 million increase in 

  

accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a 26 million increase in other longterm liabilities inventory increased to meet our production requirements for the tesla roadster as we planned for the final production of the tesla roadster and powertrain component sales as well as leasing activities the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business and the timing of vendor payments 

significant operating cash inflows during the year ended december 31 2011 were comprised primarily of automotive sales of 1486 million 557 million of development services revenue and a 610 million net increase in reservation payments partially offset by a 28 million increase in accounts receivable and a 19 million decrease in deferred revenue the increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to receivables from toyota for shipments of powertrain components under the toyota rav4 ev phase 1 contract services agreement and shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler under the daimler smart fortwo and aclass ev programs 

net cash used in operating activities was 1278 million during the year ended december 31 2010 the largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of 1543 million which included noncash charges of 212 million related to stockbased compensation expense 106 million related to depreciation and amortization and 50 million related to the fair value change in our warrant liabilities significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 1776 million of operating expenses 860 million of cost of revenues a 285 million increase in inventory and operating lease vehicles and a 50 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a 133 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 35 million increase in other longterm liabilities inventory increased to meet our production requirements for the tesla roadster and powertrain component sales while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business as well as our increased manufacturing and model s development activities operating lease vehicles increased with the introduction of our leasing program in 2010 other longterm liabilities increased as a result of higher warranty liability from sales of the tesla roadster 

significant operating cash inflows during the year ended december 31 2010 were derived primarily from automotive sales of 971 million 197 million of development services revenue a 48 million increase in deferred revenues and a 47 million increase in reservation payments partially offset by a 32 million increase in accounts receivable in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery pack power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software to be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 upon execution of the agreement we received a 50 million upfront payment for which revenue is being recognized over the expected term of our performance deferred revenues also increased from our vehicle leasing activities as lease downpayments are recognized over the term of the operating leases the increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to powertrain component sales in relation to daimler’s smart fortwo ev program as well as 23 million receivable from toyota for the achievement of the first milestone under the phase 1 contract services agreement during the year ended december 31 2010 we received 104 million of net new reservation payments for model s while reservation payments for the tesla roadster decreased by 57 million 

net cash used in operating activities was 808 million during the year ended december 31 2009 the largest component of our cash used during this year was the 557 million net loss which included noncash charges of 69 million related to depreciation and amortization 27 million related to interest on convertible notes and 14 million related to inventory writedowns as well as a noncash gain of 15 million from the extinguishment of convertible notes and warrants significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 1024 million of cost of revenues 614 million of operating expenses a 79 million increase in inventory and a 20 million increase in our prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a 34 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 09 million increase in accounts payable inventory increased to meet our production requirements while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets reflect a higher level of annual operating costs such as insurance licenses and taxes from the growth of the business the increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable were also primarily due to the growth in our business 

  

significant operating cash inflows during the year ended december 31 2009 were derived primarily from the sales of the tesla roadster as well as development compensation related to the daimler development agreement cash inflows related to automotive sales activity were 885 million comprised of 1119 million of automotive sales partially offset by a 220 million decrease in refundable reservation payments and a 15 million decrease in deferred revenues the decrease in the refundable reservation payments was due to the launch of the tesla roadster during the year ended december 31 2008 as we continued to deliver the tesla roadster to our customers in 2009 we applied the related reservation payments to the respective customers’ purchase cost cash inflows from the daimler development agreement were 132 million comprised primarily of 232 million of development compensation partially offset by a 100 million decrease in deferred development compensation the decrease in deferred development compensation was the result of the amortization of deferred development compensation that we received during the year ended december 31 2008 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations including investments in model s manufacturing as well as restricted cash that we must maintain in relation to our doe loan facility facility lease agreements equipment financing and certain vendor credit policies 

net cash used in investing activities was 1759 million during the year ended december 31 2011 primarily related to 1979 million in purchases of capital equipment and 650 million in purchases of shortterm marketable securities partially offset by 501 million of net transfers out of our dedicated doe account in accordance with the provisions of the doe loan facility and 400 million from the maturity of shortterm marketable securities the increase in capital purchases was primarily due to significant development and construction activities at the tesla factory as well as purchases of model s related manufacturing equipment and tooling 

net cash used in investing activities was 1803 million during the year ended december 31 2010 primarily related to capital purchases of 1054 million and a net increase in restricted cash of 749 million the increase in capital purchases was driven primarily by 652 million of payments made in relation to our purchase of our tesla factory located in fremont california from nummi and certain manufacturing assets located thereon to be used for our model s manufacturing as well as 402 million primarily related to other model s capital expenditures our transition to and build out of our powertrain manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters in palo alto california and purchases of manufacturing equipment our purchase transactions with nummi were completed in october 2010 the increase in restricted cash was primarily related to 1000 million of net proceeds from our ipo and concurrent toyota private placement that we transferred to a dedicated account as required by our doe loan facility partially offset by 264 million that was transferred out of the dedicated account during the third and fourth quarters of 2010 in accordance with the provisions of the doe loan facility 

net cash used in investing activities was 142 million during the year ended december 31 2009 primarily related to capital purchases of 119 million and an increase in restricted cash of 24 million the increase in restricted cash was primarily related to standard credit policies required by our online payment vendor and security deposits related to lease agreements and equipment financing 

cash flows from financing activities 

we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from issuances of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of 2968 million on a cumulative basis through december 31 2009 from loans under the doe loan facility beginning in 2010 and more recently from the net proceeds from our public offerings and private placements of common stock 

net cash provided by financing activities was 4460 million during the year ended december 31 2011 and was comprised primarily of 2315 million received from our followon public offering and concurrent private 

  

placements completed in june 2011 2044 million received from our drawdowns under the doe loan facility and 105 million received from the exercise of common stock options by employees and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of december 31 2011 certain significant cash obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands 

 

 in october 2010 we completed the purchase of our tesla factory located in fremont california from nummi nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at the fremont site which affect soil and groundwater and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues we cannot determine with certainty the potential costs to remediate any preexisting contamination based on management’s best estimate we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be 53 million which is not reflected in the table above as the timing of any potential payments cannot be reasonably determined at this time as nummi continues with its decommissioning activities and as we continue with our construction and operating activities it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially 

we have reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing 

on the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on the remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement 

  

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we held reservation payments of 918 million and 308 million from potential customers respectively which are not reflected in the table above as of december 31 2011 we held reservation payments for undelivered model s sedans in an aggregate amount of 900 million and payments for tesla roadsters in an aggregate amount of 18 million as of december 31 2010 we held reservation payments for undelivered model s sedans in an aggregate amount of 283 million and payments for tesla roadsters in an aggregate amount of 25 million in order to convert the reservation payments into revenue we will need to sell vehicles to these customers all reservation payments for model s are fully refundable until such time that a customer enters into a purchase agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency risk 

a portion of our revenues costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were denominated in foreign currencies this is primarily due to the contract with lotus cars limited in the united kingdom to manufacture the tesla roadster vehicles and gliders and other parts sourced in europe furthermore we intend to globally procure the model s parts which may result in the increase of the procurement costs if the value of the us dollar depreciates significantly against foreign currencies in addition our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses denominated in foreign currencies principally in the british pound the euro and the japanese yen these costs exposure are partially offset by our sales growth in these regions since payments for vehicles sold in these regions are denominated in the local currency this provides a partial natural hedge to our cost exposure in europe and asia depending on our sales levels in these regions our battery cell purchases from asian suppliers are also subject to currency risk to date the foreign currency effect on our consolidated financial statements has not been significant 

interest rate risk 

we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities totaling 2803 million as of december 31 2011 a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds the cash and cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents and marketable securities declines in interest rates however would reduce future investment income 

as of december 31 2011 we had 251 million invested in shorterterm marketable securities if interest rates increase the market value of our investments may decline which could result in a realized loss if we are required to sell a security before its scheduled maturity if overall interest rates had risen by 100 basis points the fair value of our net investment position as of december 31 2011 would have decreased by approximately 38000 assuming consistent levels 

as of december 31 2011 we have received loans under the doe loan facility for an aggregate of 2763 million with interest rates ranging from 10 to 34 as we continue to borrow under our doe loan facility interest rates will be determined by the secretary of the treasury as of the date of each loan based on the treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such loan we also have capital lease obligations of 39 million as of december 31 2011 which are fixed rate instruments and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates

 item 1 business tableend we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies we believe our vehicles electric vehicle engineering expertise and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers 

we are the first company to commercially produce a federallycompliant electric vehicle the tesla roadster which achieves a marketleading range on a single charge combined with attractive design driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions our tesla roadster offers impressive acceleration and performance without producing any tailpipe emissions the tesla roadster’s proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business and with design enhancements will also form the basis for our model s sedan which is currently scheduled to begin production in mid2012 in addition we provide services for the development of electric powertrain components and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers as evidenced by our development services and sales of battery packs and chargers to daimler ag daimler for its smart fortwo and aclass electric vehicles and our agreement to produce a validated electric powertrain system for toyota motor corporation toyota for use in its rav4 ev 

the commercial production of a highway capable fully electric vehicle that meets consumers’ range and performance expectations required substantial design engineering and integration work on almost every system of our tesla roadster our roots in silicon valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering power electronics and software engineering we have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration we believe these capabilities coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the tesla roadster 

we sell and service our tesla roadster though our companyowned sales and service network our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing maintain and strengthen the tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback our tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and as a result do not require corresponding large floor spaces we believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership combined with our product design based on modularity and common platforms will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business we believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers 

our first vehicle the tesla roadster can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 39 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour the roadster sport version can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 37 seconds the tesla roadster has a range of 245 miles on a single charge as determined using the united states environmental protection agency’s epa’s combined twocycle cityhighway test recently the epa announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles including ours the tesla roadster has a range that is almost double that of any other commercially released electric vehicle and reportedly set a new world distance record of 313 miles on a single charge for a production electric car in a rally across australia as part of the 2009 global green challenge the current effective price of the base configuration of the tesla roadster is 101500 in the united states assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles the tesla roadster is currently in production and as of december 31 2010 we had delivered over 1500 tesla roadsters to customers in 31 countries almost all of which were sold in 

  

north america and europe to date our customers have driven the tesla roadster for an estimated aggregate of over 90 million miles we have developed extensive software systems to manage the overall efficiency safety and controls within our vehicles additionally we have met battery shipping and testing protocols of the united nations united states department of transportation and other government agencies allowing us to ship the tesla roadster to a number of countries throughout the world 

we announced our second electric vehicle the model s with the public exhibition of a drivable early prototype in march 2009 we currently plan to begin production of the model s in mid2012 we are designing the model s to be a four door fivepassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling as a fully electric vehicle the model s will produce zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of under 6 seconds we currently anticipate that the base model s will have an effective price of 49900 in the united states with the standard 160 mile battery pack assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles even without the tax credit we believe the base list price will be competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles we are designing the model s to offer a variety of range options from 160 miles to 300 miles on a single charge as projected using the epa’s combined twocycle cityhighway test the epa has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles including ours 

we anticipate that the initial units of the model s will be introduced with a signature series which will include certain colors and options some of which may not be available in the general production of the model s we also plan to offer the capability to fast charge in as little as 45 minutes at commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future and the ability to rapidly swap out its battery pack at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility to complement its range capabilities we believe that the model s will demonstrate our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer longrange capabilities and uncompromised performance energy efficiency convenience and design 

we are designing the model s for a significantly broader customer base than the tesla roadster accordingly we currently intend to target an annual production rate of up to approximately 20000 cars per year from our planned manufacturing facility in fremont california the drivable early prototype of the model s was exhibited to the public in march 2009 and the first alpha prototype was driving before the end of 2010 as of december 31 2010 we had received approximately 3400 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of 5000 

we intend to develop a substantially integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in fremont california for the manufacture of the model s and its components in october 2010 we completed the purchase of this facility from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi we intend to use the facility for the production of our planned model s vehicle and to build our future electric vehicles we have entered into a loan agreement with the united states federal financing bank and united states department of energy doe loan facility to arrange loans for up to 4650 million loan 3639 million of which is intended for the continued development of the model s and the build out of our fremont facility 

the electric powertrain we developed for the tesla roadster has provided the foundational technology for our planned model s our future vehicles and for electric powertrain components that we have begun selling to daimler and its affiliates and that we intend to sell to toyota our electric powertrain consists of only four physical components our modular battery pack our power electronics module gearbox and our motor this component design contains far fewer moving parts than a gasoline powertrain these features enable us to adapt it for a variety of vehicle applications the tesla roadster electric powertrain will be the basis of the model s powertrain with design enhancements similarly using the existing tesla roadster battery pack we have worked with daimler since june 2008 to develop a battery pack and charging system for an initial trial of the smart fortwo electric drive vehicle pilot program in at least five european cities we have expanded this business 

  

by developing and selling additional powertrain components to daimler and toyota and have secured 1012 million of an aggregate 4650 million from our doe loan facility to fund the infrastructure for these powertrain activities we believe that our efforts in our powertrain development will enable us to advance our technology and rapidly and cost effectively develop vehicles 

our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver marketleading range capability on the tesla roadster at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatthour the battery pack of the tesla roadster uses commercially available lithiumion battery cells and contains 53 kilowatthours of usable energy almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack thereby significantly increasing its range capability designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs motors powertrain systems and vehicle engineering our proprietary technology includes cooling systems safety systems charge balancing systems battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding reallife driving conditions these technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio—as of february 3 2011 we had 35 issued patents and approximately 280 pending patent applications with the united states patent and trademark office and internationally in a broad range of areas 

we are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles first our battery pack is based on commodity battery cells placed in modules that we believe will form the basis of later generations of our battery packs such as those we are developing for the model s second we use upgradeable software extensively for managing vehicle performance and the driver experience finally we are designing a common platform architecture for the model s which compactly positions the battery pack motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle we believe this architecture will form the basis of several future vehicles including our planned model x crossover vehicle and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future 

our design and vehicle engineering capabilities combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design styling and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles as a result we believe our tesla roadster customers enjoy and model s customers will enjoy several benefits including 

 

  

   

  

 our vehicles and products 

we currently design manufacture and sell the tesla roadster our first production vehicle we are designing our second vehicle the model s and currently plan to begin production of the model s in mid2012 we intend to design the model s with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of the model s to create future electric vehicles targeting additional segments of the passenger vehicle market 

the tesla roadster 

our first vehicle the tesla roadster is the first highperformance electric sports car and the only highwaycapable electric vehicle available in the united states today the twoseat convertible tesla roadster has a combination of range style performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today as of december 31 2010 we had delivered over 1500 tesla roadsters to customers in 31 countries almost all of which were sold to customers in north america and europe to date our customers have driven the tesla roadster for an estimated aggregate of over 90 million miles the tesla roadster complies with or is exempt from all applicable vehicle safety standards in the united states the european union as well as select other countries additionally we have met battery shipping and testing protocols of the united nations united states department of transportation and other government agencies allowing us to ship the tesla roadster to a number of countries throughout the world 

the current effective price of the base configuration of the tesla roadster is 101500 in the united states assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles the tesla roadster offers performance characteristics that we believe are among the best in the industry it can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 39 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour we believe the tesla roadster’s lightweight and proprietary electric powertrain provides significant performance advantages over traditional internal combustion enginepowered sports cars specifically the electric powertrain that delivers peak torque in excess of 200 foot pounds at extremely low revolutions per minute or rpm and remains near peak through 7000 rpm of the 13000 rpm range enables the tesla roadster to achieve its high levels of acceleration with such a long and flat torque curve we believe the tesla roadster delivers a compelling driving experience with instantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed 

the tesla roadster combines this performance with highenergy efficiency the tesla roadster has a battery pack capable of storing approximately 53 kilowatthours of usable energy almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack and has a range of 245 miles on a single charge as determined using the united states epa’s combined twocycle cityhighway test recently the epa announced its intention to introduce and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles including ours the tesla roadster reportedly set a new world distance record of 313 miles on a single charge for a production 

  

electric car in a rally across australia as part of the 2009 global green challenge assuming a 245 mile range of the tesla roadster and an electricity cost of 117 cents per kilowatthour which was the average residential electricity cost in the united states for november 2010 the energy cost of powering the tesla roadster is approximately 31 cents per mile in comparison assuming an average gasoline price of 286 per gallon the average gasoline price in the united states for november 2010 the 2010 toyota prius has a fuel cost of approximately 57 cents per mile and the 2009 porsche 911 carrera has a fuel cost of approximately 132 cents per mile we believe these energy cost differences would be greater in europe where gasoline prices can be almost three times higher than in the united states 

the cumulative capital expenditures and research and development costs for the tesla roadster from our inception to the date we delivered our first tesla roadster equaled approximately 125 million 

we have continued to rapidly develop the tesla roadster since its introduction in june 2009 nine months after its commercial introduction we launched the 2010 tesla roadster known as the tesla roadster 2 as well as a highperformance variant the tesla roadster sport as compared to the original tesla roadster the tesla roadster 2 delivered a higher quality interior a new pushbutton gear selector improved heating and cooling performance a more powerful electric powertrain and improved noise reduction new optional features were also added including clear coat carbon fiber trim for the exterior and interior an adjustable suspension and improved vehicle data connectivity via a gsm module in addition to making these enhancements we simultaneously reduced our manufacturing costs significantly by making a number of modifications including redesigning our power electronics module and switching to certain commodity components in our manufacturing process the tesla roadster sport offers a higher performance powertrain which improves acceleration from 0 to 60 miles per hour from 39 seconds to 37 seconds adjustable suspension and performance tires and forged wheels all without compromising the efficiency of the tesla roadster electric powertrain the current effective price of the base configuration of the tesla roadster sport is 121000 in the united states assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles we delivered our first righthand drive model of the tesla roadster in january 2010 and have since delivered righthand drive roadsters into key markets such as united kingdom japan hong kong and australia in july 2010 a year after the launch of roadster 2 we released the roadster 25 as compared to the roadster 2 the roadster 25 received an upgraded front fascia and front chin spoiler improved electronics package and double din display redesigned rear diffuser and improved noise reduction 

the performance and safety systems of the tesla roadster and its battery required the development of sophisticated control software for example we have implemented several algorithms in our vehicle control software to reduce the likelihood of unintended acceleration of our vehicles in the event of either a mechanical or electronic malfunction we stop the flow of electricity to our motor when either the car is placed in neutral or the key is rotated from the “on” position we also stop the flow of electricity to the motor during normal vehicle operation when the brake pedal is depressed for more than two seconds after the accelerator has been depressed finally we have a dedicated processor that monitors the ratio of accelerator position and torque delivered to our motor and will stop the flow of electricity to our motor if the ratio diverges from set parameters 

the tesla model s 

our planned second vehicle the model s is currently expected to begin production in mid2012 we intend to leverage technologies within the electric powertrain of the tesla roadster to create a fourdoor five adult passenger sedan that produces zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of under 6 seconds the drivable early prototype of the model s was exhibited to the public in march 2009 and as of december 31 2010 we had received approximately 3400 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of 5000 we intend to make the model s available with three range variants—160 miles 230 miles and 300 miles on a single charge as projected using the epa’s combined cityhighway test cycles—to allow customers to purchase an electric vehicle that best matches their personal driving needs we anticipate that the initial units of the model s will be introduced with a signature series which will include 

  

certain colors and options some of which may not be available in the general production of the model s we are designing the model s to include a third row with two rearfacing child seats subject to applicable safety regulations and requirements allowing us to offer a seven passenger sedan the epa has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles including ours 

to complement its range capabilities we also plan to offer the model s with a package of recharging options including the capability to fast charge in as little as 45 minutes at commercial direct current charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future this feature would offer consumers a rapid and convenient way to recharge their vehicles in addition we are designing the model s to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility we are designing the model s to offer a compelling combination of functionality convenience and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency with the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle we are designing the model s to provide best in class storage space of approximately 29 cubic feet including storage under both the tailgate and the hood by way of comparison this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 bmw 5 series sedan and the approximately 21 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 lincoln town car we are also planning to equip the model s with premium luxury features including a 17” touch screen driver interface advanced wireless connectivity such as 3g connectivity and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle we are designing the model s with the intent to achieve a five star safety rating we believe the intended combination of performance styling convenience and energy efficiency of the model s will help position it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments 

we currently anticipate that the base model s will have an effective price of 49900 in the united states with a standard 160 mile range battery pack assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a united states federal tax credit of 7500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles even without the tax credit we believe the base list price will be competitive with other premium vehicles we have not finalized pricing for the 230 or 300 mile range variants of the model s 

we are designing the model s to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class we consider the purchase price cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation we assume comparable residual values warranties insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a model s purchase in addition to the competitive pricing of the model s relative to other premium vehicles we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs for example assuming an average of 12000 miles driven per year an average electricity cost of 117 cents per kilowatthour and an average gasoline price of 286 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the united states respectively for november 2010 and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of the model s we estimate that our planned model s could have approximately 1400 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan furthermore we expect the planned model s will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components including oil oil filters spark plugs and engine valves 

future vehicle roadmap based on model s platform 

we intend to design the model s with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of the model s to create future electric vehicle models such as a crossoversport utility vehicle a van or a cabriolet in particular by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development in addition we believe our strategy of using commercially available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce models of our tesla roadster and planned 

  

vehicles with different range options our design of the model s however is not complete and we may make changes to the design of the model s including changes that may make it more difficult to use the model s platform for future vehicles 

in 2011 we publicly announced the tesla model x as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform we are designing the model x as a crossover vehicle we intend to develop a prototype of the model x by the end of 2011 

we have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle to be produced at our planned manufacturing facility in fremont california we intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our planned model s we expect that this vehicle will be produced a few years after the introduction of the model x 

powertrain development and sales 

in addition to our own vehicles we also design develop manufacture and sell advanced electric vehicle powertrain components 

in may 2009 we entered into a development agreement with daimler under which we performed specified research and development services for the development of a battery pack and charger for daimler’s smart fortwo electric drive all development work related to the development agreement had been completed as of december 31 2009 we have been selected by daimler to supply it with up to 1800 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo electric drive in at least five european cities we began shipping the first of these battery packs and chargers in november 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 

in the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 a formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with daimler in may 2010 in october 2010 we completed the development of the aclass battery pack and charger and began shipping production components for a demonstration fleet in february 2011 

in the first quarter of 2010 we completed the development and sale of modular battery packs for electric delivery vans for freightliner custom chassis corporation freightliner an affiliate of daimler freightliner plans to use these electric vans in a limited number of customer trials 

in may 2010 we and toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles and for us to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the model s in july 2010 we entered into an early phase agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with an aim by toyota to market the electric vehicle in the united states in 2012 prototypes would be made by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain we began developing and delivering prototypes to toyota for evaluation in september 2010 

in connection with the toyota rav4 program in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to our agreements toyota will pay us up to 69 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance 

we are continuing to develop our electric powertrain component and systems business and have secured a 1012 million loan under our doe loan facility for the expansion of our engineering and production capability for these activities in our palo alto facility this facility which also serves as our corporate headquarters also 

  

houses our research and development services including cell and component testing and prototyping as well as manufacturing of powertrain components for sales to third parties we also produce the battery pack gearbox and the motor for the tesla roadster at this facility so that we can efficiently share further powertrain innovations among the components for our vehicles as well as those of our customers 

technology 

we believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain and vehicle engineering our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain this powertrain is fundamentally composed of five major elements a modular battery pack a power electronics module a motor a gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system we designed each of these major elements for our tesla roadster and plan to use much of this technology in the model s and our future electric vehicles our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology further our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain these features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers 

from time to time we intend to enter into development arrangements with other automobile manufacturers for electric powertrain development activities from inception through december 31 2009 our powertrain development activities were exclusively pursuant to a development arrangement entered into in 2008 which was formalized pursuant to an agreement entered into in may 2009 with daimler related to the development of a battery pack and charger for daimler’s smart fortwo electric drive all amounts received under this development agreement were recognized as an offset to research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december 31 2009 our research and development expenses were 193 million after such offsets as of december 31 2009 all development work related to the development agreement had been completed and we had recognized the full 232 million under the development agreement during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2008 research and development expenses were 930 million and 537 million respectively 

as of december 31 2010 we had 212 employees in our powertrain research and development department 

battery pack 

we have designed our battery packs to have a life of over 100000 miles or seven years in addition we have designed battery packs to be modular so that we can leverage technology developments across our different vehicles and products for example the tesla roadster battery pack contains 6831 lithiumion cells each similar to the 6 to 12 cells made by third party lithiumion cell providers found in many standard laptop computers the battery pack contains 53 kilowatthours of usable energy almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack thereby significantly increasing vehicle range capability designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs motors powertrain systems and vehicle engineering our proprietary technology includes cooling systems safety systems charge balancing systems battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability robotic manufacturing processes customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding reallife driving conditions we have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithiumion cells in the demanding automotive environment we believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatthour to date our customers have driven the tesla roadster for an estimated aggregate of over 90 million miles 

we believe one of our core competencies is the design of our complete battery pack system we have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry form factor and vendor that we adopt for battery cell supply in so doing we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery 

  

cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the cost per kilowatthour of our battery pack we maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithiumion cell vendors and chemistry types we intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity longevity power delivery and cost we believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles we believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software electronics testing and vehicle packaging will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology 

the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage time and charging patterns for example a customer’s use of their tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery’s ability to hold a charge we currently expect that the tesla roadster battery pack will retain approximately 6065 of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100000 miles or seven years which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range in addition based on internal testing we estimate that our tesla roadster would have a 510 reduction in range when operated in 20°c temperatures 

to date we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries form factors and designs based on this evaluation we are presently using lithiumion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs these battery cells are commercially available in large quantities we currently intend to use the same battery cell form factor in the model s 

power electronics 

the power electronics in tesla’s electric powertrains govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack the power electronics has two primary functions the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging 

the first function is accomplished through the drive inverter which converts direct current dc from the battery pack into alternating current ac to drive our threephase induction motors the drive inverter also converts the ac generated by regenerative braking back into dc for electrical storage in the battery pack the drive inverter performs this function by using a highperformance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle in so doing the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle for example the power electronics in the 2010 tesla roadster sport is capable of delivering approximately 900 amps of electrical current in a matter of milliseconds enabling the rapid acceleration of the vehicle we are continuing to make advancements in the drive inverter the model s drive inverter for example will be able to deliver approximately 1000 amps of current at better efficiency and lower cost as compared to the tesla roadster drive inverter in addition we are also designing the drive inverter to integrate more directly with other components of the powertrain reducing cost and size while improving packaging efficiency 

the second function charging the battery pack is accomplished by the charger which converts alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current which can be accepted by the battery the charger enables us to use any available source of power to charge our vehicle our vehicles can recharge on any electrical outlet from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts all the way up to a high power outlet of 70 amps and 240 volts which provides optimal recharging 

since the tesla roadster charger system is built into the vehicle it is possible to charge the vehicle using a variety of power outlets charging the tesla roadster battery pack to full capacity will take approximately 7 

  

hours using a 240 volt 40 amp outlet that is widely available in many homes in the united states for electric appliances a high power connection capable of 240 volts and 70 amps reduces this charging time to about 45 hours such a connection can be installed in many homes with the assistance of a qualified electrician for additional flexibility the tesla roadster battery pack can also be charged with a 120 volt 15 amp connection using this lower power output the tesla roadster battery pack can be charged to full capacity in about 42 hours this flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home 

for the model s we plan to offer a highvoltage fast charge option that will enable the vehicle to charge from higher amperage dc commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future 

motor 

our powertrains currently use custom designed 3phase induction motors we believe we have made several important innovations in our motor design that minimize mass while still providing high power and efficiency our motors incorporate a proprietary fabricated copper rotor design our motors also include optimized winding patterns that allow for easy manufacture and fit in as much copper as possible to reduce resistance and energy losses 

we also use highquality bearings and precision balancing on the rotor and shaft to enable the spin of the motor up to 13000 revolutions per minute or rpm in normal operation combining this very high rpm rating with an instantaneous stall torque of over 200 foot pounds gives a broad torquespeed map that allows a single speed gearbox to deliver high vehicle performance 

gearbox 

we have designed a custom single speed gearbox that is manufactured inhouse for the tesla roadster the roadster gearbox combines low mass with high efficiency and can match both the speed and torque capabilities of tesla’s ac induction motors in comparison to a gasolinepowered vehicle the elimination of gear changes contributes to the rapid acceleration characteristics of the tesla roadster we plan to design and manufacture the gearbox for the upcoming model s sedan 

control software 

the performance and safety systems of the tesla roadster and its battery required the development of sophisticated control software there are numerous processors in the tesla roadster to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors the flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle for example software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the “creep” feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator similar algorithms control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle drivers use the information systems in the tesla roadster to optimize performance and charging modes and times software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems 

we plan to leverage our investment in software for the development of the model s in addition to the vehicle control software we also intend to develop software for the infotainment system of the model s 

vehicle design and engineering 

in addition to the design development and production of the powertrain we have created significant inhouse capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and 

  

systems we design and engineer bodies chassis interiors heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models 

several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle for example we redesigned the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine in addition low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio power windows and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle we have developed expertise in integrating these components with the highvoltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle 

additionally our team has expertise in lightweight materials a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range the tesla roadster is built with an internallydesigned carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass we intend to build the model s with a lightweight aluminum body and have been designing the body and chassis with a variety of materials and production methods that will help optimize the weight of the vehicle we intend to develop a substantially integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in fremont california to assemble vehicles and manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of the model s our engineering and manufacturing teams are working alongside one another in an effort to accelerate the model s development we believe the colocation of our engineering and manufacturing teams will help accelerate the development of new products and allow for faster introduction of product changes 

as of december 31 2010 we had 170 employees in our vehicle design and engineering departments 

sales and marketing 

companyowned sales 

we market and sell cars directly to consumers until we opened our first store in los angeles california in may 2008 all of our sales of the tesla roadster were conducted via the phone and internet or inperson at our headquarters and corporate events increasingly sales are being made through our network of tesla stores our tesla stores are highly visible premium outlets in major metropolitan markets that generally combine retail sales and service we intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets as of december 31 2008 we had opened 2 stores which increased to 10 stores by december 31 2009 and 16 stores by december 31 2010 as of february 28 2011 we had opened 17 tesla stores in the united states europe and asia located in boulder chicago los angeles menlo park miami new york newport beach seattle washington dc copenhagen london milan monaco munich paris tokyo and zurich we plan to open additional stores during 2011 with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection with the planned model s rollout additionally we plan to introduce a new store concept in 2011 to enhance the customer purchasing experience and to generate greater visibility for tesla products in areas of high customer foot traffic we also anticipate that we will place greater sales emphasis on the generation of model s reservations during 2011 we estimate that our store expansion will cost approximately 5 million to 10 million annually over the next several years 

we believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and service model our customers deal directly with our own teslaemployed sales and service staff creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers 

  

and service centers we believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing maintain and strengthen the tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback further we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer 

reservations 

we typically carry very limited inventory of our vehicles at our tesla stores while some customers purchase their vehicles from this inventory most of our tesla roadster customers choose to customize the appearance of their vehicle potential customers who purchase tesla roadsters manufactured to specification are required to enter into a purchase agreement and pay a nonrefundable deposit which is applied towards the purchase price of the vehicle for vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms no deposit is required for our 2011 model year tesla roadsters manufactured to specification our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial deposit which varies based on the country of purchase for the model s we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least 5000 prior to 2010 our reservation policy was to accept refundable reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a tesla roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications during the second quarter of 2010 we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for tesla roadsters manufactured to specification we also occasionally accept refundable reservation payments if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications we currently require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer reservation payments and deposits are used by us to fund in part our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand for customers who have placed a refundable reservation payment with us the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement the drivable early prototype of the model s was exhibited to the public in march 2009 and as of december 31 2010 we had received approximately 3400 customer reservations for the vehicle as of december 31 2010 we held reservation payments for undelivered tesla roadsters in an aggregate of 25 million and reservation payments for model s sedans in an aggregate of 283 million all reservation payments for the model s are fully refundable until such time that a customer enters into a purchase agreement 

leasing 

we began offering a leasing alternative to customers of our tesla roadster in the united states and canada in 2010 leases are offered through our wholly owned subsidiary tesla motors leasing inc under this program we currently permit qualifying customers to lease the tesla roadster for generally 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we are using a third party provider to administer the back office services including billing and collections of the leases 

marketing 

our principal marketing goals are to 

 

  

  

  

 as the first company to commercially produce a federallycompliant fully electric vehicle that achieves marketleading range on a single charge we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our 

  

company and our vehicles and we believe we will continue to do so to date media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs we also use traditional means of advertising including product placement in a variety of media outlets and payperclick advertisements on websites and applications relevant to our target demographics 

the strength of our brand has been highlighted by independent authorities for example in november 2009 advertising age selected us as one of “america’s hottest brands” in a special report highlighting the year’s 50 top brands 

our marketing efforts include events where our vehicles are displayed and demonstrated these events range from widely attended public events such as the detroit los angeles and frankfurt auto shows to smaller events oriented towards sales such as private drive events 

as of december 31 2010 we had 121 employees in our sales and marketing department 

companyowned service and warranty 

service 

service of our electric vehicles takes place at most of our tesla stores going forward we intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets within countries that are covered by our warranty agreement we offer at home service through our mobile service technicians known as the tesla rangers we charge customers a fixed rate per mile for our tesla rangers technicians’ return trip from the location of the customer’s vehicle to the nearest tesla store for customers that are not covered by our warranty agreement we offer at home service at a higher cost 

tesla owners can upload data from their vehicle and send it to us on a memory card or via an onboard gsm system allowing us to diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle when maintenance or service is required a customer can schedule service by contacting one of our regional tesla stores our tesla rangers can perform an array of procedures at a remote location from annual inspections and firmware upgrades to full replacement of a power electronics module and other mechanical and electrical components if service is more extensive and requires a vehicle lift we can coordinate shipping of vehicles to and from the nearest tesla store 

we believe that our companyowned service enables our technicians to work closely with our engineers and research and development teams in silicon valley to identify problems find solutions and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers 

as of december 31 2010 we had 79 employees in our service department 

new vehicle limited warranty policy 

we provide a three year or 36000 miles new vehicle limited warranty with every tesla roadster which we extended to four years or 50000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 tesla roadster customers have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36000 miles whichever comes first the new vehicle limited warranty is similar to other vehicle manufacturer’s warranty programs and is intended to cover all parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems battery powertrain and brake system exceptions to the new vehicle limited warranty include wear items such as tires brake pads and rotors paint wear and tear interior wear and tear and battery performance 

  

battery replacement option 

while battery failure due to defects in material or workmanship is included in the new vehicle limited warranty battery performance specifically its ability to store electricity over time is not covered in either the new vehicle limited warranty or the extended service plan however within three months of purchasing a vehicle customers may purchase a onetime option to replace the battery pack at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle for customers that select this option we agree to replace the original battery of the vehicle with a replacement battery which will store at least 53 kilowatthours of usable energy charges in addition to the option purchase price apply if the customer exercises the battery replacement option prior to the seventh anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle the customer is entitled to a partial refund of the option purchase price if the option is not elected by the eighth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle 

manufacturing 

vehicle assembly 

we currently use a multisite manufacturing process for production of the tesla roadster and plan to transition to our planned substantially integrated site for production of the model s and future vehicles in fremont california the initial body and chassis assembly processes for our tesla roadster occur at a lotus cars limited lotus facility in hethel england where our staff works closely with lotus for vehicles destined for the united states we ship the rolling chassis which does not contain our electric powertrain and which we call a glider to our final assembly facility in menlo park california at our menlo park location we install the full electric vehicle powertrain and perform a predelivery inspection prior to shipping the tesla roadster to customers for european and asian deliveries the full vehicle is assembled online at the lotus facility and predelivery inspection occurs at a nearby tesla facility in wymondham england pursuant to the supply agreement with lotus we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 2400 vehicles or gliders over the term of the agreement we currently intend to manufacture gliders with lotus for our current generation tesla roadster until january 2012 we intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the tesla roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted accordingly we intend to offer a limited number of tesla roadsters for sale in 2012 to the extent we wish to sell additional tesla roadsters with the lotus gliders beyond those we have contracted for we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with lotus as of december 31 2010 we had purchased approximately 1700 vehicles or gliders under this agreement 

we intend to develop a substantially integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in fremont california to manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of the model s including stamping plastics body assembly paint operations battery pack manufacturing final vehicle assembly and endofline testing certain major component systems will be purchased from suppliers we currently intend to target an annual production rate at this facility for the model s of up to approximately 20000 cars per year we believe that we will be able to increase the annual production capacity of this plant beyond this amount through additional capital spending as well as by changing operating patterns and adding additional shifts 

powertrain component manufacturing 

in addition to developing our planned model s and future vehicle manufacturing facility in fremont california we are currently designing and manufacturing lithiumion battery packs electric motors gearboxes and components both for our vehicles and for our original equipment manufacturer customers in our electric powertrain manufacturing facility in palo alto california specifically at the palo alto facility 

 

   

  

  

 we intend to develop our electric powertrain component and systems business and have secured a 1012 million loan under our doe loan facility for the expansion of our engineering and production capability for these activities in our palo alto facility we intend to manufacture the powertrain components for the model s and for the toyota rav 4 ev at this facility and at our planned fremont manufacturing facility 

supply chain 

the tesla roadster uses over 2000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 150 suppliers many of whom are currently our single source suppliers for these components we have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain electric powertrain components while we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source we refer to these component suppliers as our single source suppliers to date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain longterm agreements with our single source suppliers for example while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for the tesla roadster daimler smart fortwo and daimler aclass are available we have fully qualified only one supplier for these cells any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative suppliers on a timely basis moreover battery cell manufactures may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe 

while we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us in particular while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for almost all of our single sourced components on a relatively short time frame qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of the tesla roadster such as the carbon fiber body panels which are supplied to us by sotira 35 a unit of sora composites group 

in addition lotus is the only manufacturer for certain components such as the chassis of our tesla roadster and we refer to it as a sole source supplier we do not currently utilize any sole source suppliers other than lotus replacing the components from lotus that are sole sourced may require us to reengineer our vehicles which would be time consuming and costly 

we are currently designing and sourcing components for the model s that will leverage worldclass automotive suppliers we plan to leverage our relationships with daimler and toyota to access their supply bases and gain access to some low cost high quality parts 

we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel carbon fiber nonferrous metals such as copper as well as nickel and cobalt the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials we believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements there are always risks and uncertainties however with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities or reasonable prices to meet our needs 

  

we have implemented enterprise resource planning and management software to automate our procurement and inventory processes and integrate them with our financial accounting we plan additional investment in our management systems to support further growth in our operations 

quality control 

our quality control efforts are divided between product quality and supplier quality both of which are focused on designing and producing products and processes with high levels of reliability our product quality engineers work with our engineering team and our suppliers to help ensure that the product designs meet functional specifications and durability requirements our supplier quality engineers work with our suppliers to ensure that their processes and systems are capable of delivering the parts we need at the required quality level on time and on budget our quality systems engineers create and manage our systems such as configuration management and corrective action systems to help ensure product developers supplier chain managers and production controllers have the product information they need 

as of december 31 2010 we had 213 employees in our manufacturing department 

customers and selected relationships 

we currently sell our cars primarily to individual customers we have strategic or commercial relationships with daimler toyota and lotus as well as with various battery cell providers we intend to expand our business by developing and selling additional powertrain components to daimler toyota and other third party oems and have secured a 1012 million loan under our doe loan facility to fund the infrastructure these activities 

daimler ag 

beginning in 2008 we commenced efforts on a powertrain development arrangement with daimler in may 2009 we entered into a development agreement with daimler under which we have performed specified research and development services for the development of a battery pack and charger for daimler’s smart fortwo electric drive all development work related to the development agreement had been completed as of december 31 2009 we have been selected by daimler to supply it with approximately 1800 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo electric drive in at least five european cities we began shipping the first sets of these battery packs and chargers in november 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 in the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 a formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with daimler in may 2010 in october 2010 we completed the development of the aclass battery pack and charger and began shipping production parts in february 2011 in the first quarter of 2010 we completed the development and sale of modular battery packs for electric delivery vans for freightliner an affiliate of daimler freightliner plans to use these electric vans in a limited number of customer trials 

in addition to the development agreement described above we have entered into an exclusivity and intellectual property agreement eip agreement with daimler north america corporation dnac an affiliate of daimler in which we agreed to begin negotiating in good faith to enter into further agreements within certain strategic cooperation areas including technology collaboration in various electric powertrain areas automotive engineering support joint electric vehicle development efforts and access to component parts for tesla designed products under this eip agreement we agreed that until november 11 2009 we would not negotiate or enter into any agreements with other parties that would be competitive with the arrangements contemplated for these strategic cooperation areas unless the results of such arrangement would be marketed solely under the tesla brand as of that date we had not executed any further agreements with daimler in the areas of strategic cooperation 

  

the eip agreement provides that ending june 29 2013 if the company receives an offer from a strategic competitor of daimler to enter into an agreement for development of a nontesla branded vehicle or an integrated electric powertrain system dnac would be given the right of first refusal to enter into such agreement with the company instead of and on the same terms offered by the third party 

the eip agreement also provides that if we execute a strategic cooperation agreement with dnac to jointly engineer an electric vehicle then additional exclusivities would apply until june 29 2013 provided a minimum annual volume of sales is achieved the eip agreement provides that none of the restrictions set out in that agreement or in any strategic agreement would limit us from developing technology with any third party for use in a teslabranded product or service or related to the tesla roadster or model s engaging in any transaction with a company that is not a daimler competitor or supplying components for electric powertrains that are designed by third parties 

the eip agreement also provides that if the parties enter into the strategic agreements or further agreements those agreements will allocate intellectual property rights according to certain principles outlined in the eip agreement in addition until june 29 2013 before licensing intellectual property generated outside the scope of any strategic cooperation area to a daimler competitor we would first have to offer dnac the right to license the intellectual property on a nonexclusive royaltybearing basis or on an exclusive basis in the automotive field and if dnac requests the latter we must negotiate such a license in good faith if no agreement is reached however we would be free to license the technology to the daimler competitor and dnac could take a nonexclusive license both we and daimler have the right to terminate the eip agreement in the event the other party undergoes or executes an agreement to undergo a change of control any strategic cooperation agreements entered into between us and daimler prior to termination will not be affected by such termination 

to date with the exception of the development agreement for the smart fortwo electric drive and the agreement for the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of daimler’s aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe in 2011 the strategic agreements described in the eip agreement have not been entered into and there can be no assurance that the parties will ever enter into such agreements even if we were to enter into such agreements the parties may negotiate and agree to terms that are different to those set forth in the eip agreement and outlined above such different or new terms may be more or less favorable to us 

in addition to these agreements blackstar lnvestco llc blackstar an affiliate of daimler beneficially owned 7475740 shares of our common stock as of december 31 2010 blackstar’s representative dr herbert kohler serves as a member of our board of directors 

toyota motor corporation 

in may 2010 we and toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles and for us to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the model s in july 2010 we entered into an early phase agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with an aim by toyota to market the electric vehicle in the united states in 2012 prototypes would be made by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain we began developing and delivering prototypes to toyota for evaluation in september 2010 pursuant to the agreement toyota will pay us up to 9 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance 

in connection with the toyota rav4 program in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to the agreement toyota will pay us up to 60 million for the anticipated 

  

development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance in addition to these agreements in july 2010 we sold 2941176 shares of our common stock to toyota at our initial public offering price of 1700 per share 

panasonic 

panasonic is the supplier of cells for one of our current battery packs in january 2010 we announced that we were collaborating with panasonic on the development of nextgeneration electric vehicle cells based on the 18650 form factor and nickelbased lithium ion chemistry in november 2010 we sold 1418573 shares of our common stock to an entity affiliated with panasonic corporation at a price of 2115 per share which was the average of the trading highs and lows of our common stock from october 25 to october 29 2010 

lotus cars limited 

lotus currently provides us with assembly and other manufacturing services although we complete the final assembly of our tesla roadster the initial body and chassis assembly processes occur at a lotus facility in hethel england where our staff works closely with lotus for vehicles destined for the united states we ship the glider to our final assembly facility in menlo park california for european and asian deliveries the full vehicle is assembled online at the lotus facility and predelivery inspection occurs at a tesla facility in wymondham england pursuant to the supply agreement with lotus we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 2400 vehicles or gliders over the term of the agreement if we are unable to meet this volume requirement we are still responsible for payment to lotus of the lesser of the sum of the actual costs incurred and an agreed upon profit margin per vehicle up to the minimum volume requirement or £5400000 we currently intend to manufacture gliders with lotus for our current generation tesla roadster until january 2012 we intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the tesla roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted accordingly we intend to offer a limited number of tesla roadsters for sale in 2012 to the extent we wish to sell additional tesla roadsters with the lotus gliders beyond those we have contracted for we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with lotus as of december 31 2010 we had purchased approximately 1700 vehicles or gliders under this agreement 

governmental programs incentives and regulations 

united states department of energy loans 

on january 20 2010 we entered into a loan facility with the federal financing bank ffb and the united states department of energy doe under the doe’s advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program as set forth in section 136 of the energy independence and security act of 2007 atvm program we refer to such loan facility as the doe loan facility under the doe loan facility ffb has made available to us two multidraw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to 4650 million and the doe has agreed to reimburse ffb for any liabilities losses costs or expenses incurred by ffb with respect to the term loan facilities up to an aggregate principal amount of 1012 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to 80 of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the powertrain engineering and the buildout of a facility to design and manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors and electric components the powertrain facility up to an aggregate principal amount of 3639 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80 of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the development of and to build out the manufacturing facility for our model s sedan the model s facility under the doe loan facility we are responsible for the remaining 20 of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project the costs paid by us to date for the powertrain facility and the model s facility will be applied towards our obligation to contribute 20 of the eligible project costs and the doe’s funding of future eligible costs will be adjusted to take this into account our remaining obligations for the development and 

  

buildout of our manufacturing facility for the model s is budgeted to be an aggregate of 33 million plus any cost overruns for the projects we have paid for the full 20 of the budgeted costs related to our powertrain facility but will continue to be responsible for cost overruns 

our ability to draw down funds under the doe loan facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions for the powertrain facility the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components for the model s facility the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the model s and the planned model s manufacturing facility we will be required to maintain at all times available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105 of the amounts required to fund such commitment after taking into account current cash flows and cash on hand and reasonable projections of future generation of net cash from operations losses and expenditures 

loans may be requested under the facilities until january 22 2013 and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date on the closing date we paid a facility fee to the doe in the amount of 05 million through december 31 2010 we have received draw downs under the doe loan facility for an aggregate of 718 million with interest rates ranging from 17 to 34 for eligible project costs under both projects that we have incurred from december 15 2008 through october 31 2010 

advances under the doe loan facility accrue interest at a per annum rate determined by the secretary of the treasury as of the date of the advance and will be based on the treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such advance interest on advances under the doe loan facility is payable quarterly in arrears advances under the powertrain facility are repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments commencing on december 15 2012 or for advances made after such date in 26 equal quarterly installments commencing on june 15 2013 all outstanding amounts under the powertrain facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of september 15 2019 advances under the model s facility are repayable in 40 equal quarterly installments commencing on december 15 2012 or for advances made after such date in 38 equal quarterly installments commencing on june 15 2013 all outstanding amounts under the model s facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of september 15 2022 advances under the loan facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at any time at a price determined based on interest rates at the time of prepayment for loans made from the secretary of the treasury to ffb for obligations with an identical payment schedule to the advance being prepaid which could result in the advance being prepaid at a discount at par or at a premium the loan facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment with net cash proceeds received from certain dispositions loss events with respect to property and other extraordinary receipts 

all obligations under the doe loan facility are secured by substantially all of our property all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries will also be required to guaranty our obligations under the doe loan facility our existing and future foreign subsidiaries may under certain circumstances be required to guaranty our obligations under the loan facility any such guarantees by existing and future subsidiaries will be secured by substantially all of the property of such subsidiaries 

the doe loan facility documents contain customary covenants that include among others a requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project compliance with all requirements of the atvm program and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness incur liens make investments or loans enter into mergers or acquisitions dispose of assets pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock pay indebtedness pay management advisory or similar fees to affiliates enter into certain affiliate transactions enter into new lines of business and enter into certain restrictive agreements in each case subject to customary exceptions 

the doe loan facility documents also contain financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities and i through december 15 2012 a minimum cash balance and 

  

ii after december 15 2012 a maximum leverage ratio a minimum interest coverage ratio a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio a limit on capital expenditures and after march 31 2014 a maximum ratio of total liabilities to shareholder equity under the doe loan facility we are required to fund a debt service reserve account on or before december 31 2012 in an amount equal to all principal and interest that will come due on the advances on the next two payment dates once we have deposited such two payments we will not be required to further fund such debt service reserve account we have also agreed that in connection with the sale of our stock in any followon equity offering at least 50 of the net offering proceeds will be received by us offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers directors employees or consultants in excess of the amounts contemplated by our business plan approved by the doe we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants 

in addition to our obligation to fund a portion of the project costs as described above we have set aside 100 million from the net proceeds from our initial public offering and concurrent private placement to fund a separate dedicated account under our doe loan facility this dedicated account can be used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and model s manufacturing facility projects and will also be used as a mechanism to defer advances under the doe loan facility this will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the doe loans but will require us to use the dedicated account to fund certain project costs up front which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the doe loan facility once the dedicated account is depleted or as part of the final advance for the applicable project we will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account in an amount equal to up to 30 of the remaining project costs for the applicable project and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the draw down of additional loans under our doe loan facility once used in full as of december 31 2010 we have 736 million remaining in the dedicated account 

the doe loan facility documents contain customary events of default subject in some cases to customary cure periods for certain defaults events of default include among others nonpayment defaults inaccuracy of representations and warranties covenant defaults defaults under or termination of our leases for the projects a default in the event of a change of control including a failure of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman and certain of his affiliates at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to the model s facility to own at least 65 of capital stock held by mr musk and such affiliates as of the date of the doe loan facility crossdefaults to certain other material indebtedness failure to timely complete the projects material judgment defaults bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and force majeure events with respect to the projects the occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of all obligations under the doe loan facility documents an obligation by us and any guarantor to repay all obligations in full and the exercise of remedies by the doe or their agent our failure to make a timely payment could result in an increase to the applicable interest rate 

in connection with the doe loan facility we have also issued the doe a warrant to purchase up to 3085011 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 754 per share and a warrant to purchase up to 5100 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 894 per share beginning on december 15 2018 and until december 14 2022 the shares subject to purchase under these warrants will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter these warrants may be exercised until december 15 2023 if we prepay the doe loan facility in full prior to december 15 2018 no shares will be exercisable under these warrants except in the case of an event of default which could accelerate the vesting 

california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority tax incentives 

in december 2009 we finalized an arrangement with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority that will result in an exemption from california state sales and use taxes for up to 320 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales and use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by 

  

us of up to approximately 31 million over a three year period starting in december 2009 the equipment purchases may be used only for three purposes i to establish our production facility for the model s sedan in california ii to upgrade our palo alto powertrain production facility and iii to expand our current tesla roadster assembly operations at our menlo park facility as of december 31 2010 we have received the tax exemption for approximately 348 million in asset purchases 

california air resources board’s zero emissions vehicle program 

in connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in a number of states we have earned and will continue to earn tradable credits that can be sold under california’s lowemission vehicle regulations and similar laws in other states vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles currently the states of california connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new jersey new york oregon rhode island and vermont have such laws in effect these laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits referred to as zev credits and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements as a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles we earn zev credits on each vehicle sold in such states and have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the zev credits that we earn 

we have entered into two contracts for the sale of zev credits with two separate automotive manufacturers for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we earned revenue from the sale of zev credits of 28 million 82 million and 35 million respectively our current agreement with american honda co inc honda provides for the sale of zev credits that we earn from the sale of vehicles that we manufacture through december 31 2011 as of december 31 2010 we had sold credits for 491 vehicles under this agreement and honda has an obligation to purchase credits for up to 150 additional vehicles that tesla will manufacture prior to the expiration of the agreement to the extent we have additional zev credits available for sale we may enter into new agreements with honda or other manufacturers to sell such credits we previously had an agreement with a different buyer for zev credits related to vehicles sold in the year ended december 31 2008 some of which zev credits were recognized in the year ended december 31 2009 

regulation—vehicle safety and testing 

our vehicles are subject to and the tesla roadster complies with or is exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa including all applicable united states federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss as a manufacturer we must selfcertify that a vehicle meets or otherwise obtain an exemption from all applicable fmvsss as well as the nhtsa bumper standard before the vehicle can be imported into or sold in the united states there are numerous fmvsss that apply to our vehicles examples of these requirements include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

several fmvss regulations that nhtsa has promulgated or amended recently contain phasein provisions requiring increasing percentages of a manufacturer’s vehicles to comply over a period of several model years those fmvsss generally allow low volume manufacturers those who manufacture fewer than 5000 vehicles annually for sale in the united states and limited line manufacturers those who sell three or fewer vehicle lines in the united states to defer compliance until the end of the phasein period we currently qualify as both a low volume manufacturer and a limited line manufacturer and as a result we are currently exempt from certain requirements such as some new advanced airbag requirements the advanced side impact requirements and certain electronic stability control requirements until the end of the applicable phasein periods in addition we have applied for and have been granted an exemption from certain other advanced air bag requirements which applies to tesla roadsters manufactured through january 28 2011 we have filed a request for an extension of such exemption for tesla roadsters manufactured after such date while that application is pending and under consideration by nhtsa the existing exemption is automatically extended under us law we are required to certify compliance with or obtain exemption from all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the united states based on testing engineering analysis and other information we have certified that the tesla roadster complies with or is exempt from all applicable nhtsa standards by affixing a certification label to each tesla roadster sold 

we are also required to comply with other nhtsa requirements of federal laws administered by nhtsa including the corporate average fuel economy standards consumer information labeling requirements early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements 

our vehicles sold in europe are subject to european union safety testing regulations many of those regulations referred to as european union whole vehicle type approval wvta are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the united states and may require redesign andor retesting our tesla roadsters are currently approved for sale on a limited basis in the european union via the small series wvta which permits the manufacture and sale in the european union of no more than 1000 vehicles per year we plan to keep european sales of our tesla roadsters at less than 1000 vehicles per year and have no plans to commence testing our tesla roadsters for the wvta to assure compliance with the european union requirements to permit unlimited sales similarly australia and japan have additional testing regulations applicable to high volume manufacturers we also plan to keep australian and japanese sales of our tesla roadsters at a low volume and have no plans to comply with the australian and japanese requirements to permit high volume sales in these jurisdictions in connection with the planned introduction of the tesla roadster in australia and japan we conducted a frontal impact test based on european union testing standards on the tesla roadster in november 2009 which is required for sales exceeding certain annual volumes outside the united states while the tesla roadster met most of the criteria for occupant protection and all criteria for high voltage safety in the front impact crash test there were two criteria that were not met in the test based on our analysis of additional compliance options in australia and japan we believe such an outcome should not limit our ability to sell the tesla roadster in australia below certain annual volumes or subject to compliance with certain japanese import rules have a material impact on our ability to sell tesla roadsters in japan 

the federal trade commission ftc requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle’s window the ftc specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the society of automotive engineers sae which further requires that we test using the united states epa’s combined city and highway testing cycles the epa announced in november 2009 that it would develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles based on initial indications from the epa we believe it is likely that the epa will modify its testing cycles in a manner that when applied to our vehicles could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles by up to 30 as compared to the combined twocycle test currently applicable to our vehicles however there can be no assurance that the modified epa testing cycles will not result in a greater reduction to the extent that the ftc adopts these procedures in place of the current procedures from the sae this could impair our ability to advertise the tesla roadster as a vehicle that is capable of going in excess of 200 miles moreover such changes could impair our ability to deliver the model s with the 

  

initially advertised range which could result in the cancellation of a number of the approximately 3400 reservations that have been placed for the model s as of december 31 2010 although the real life customer experience of the range of our electric vehicles will not change due to the changes in the ftc or epa standards the reduction in the advertised range could negatively impact our sales and harm our business 

the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition the act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by epa as well as crash test ratings as determined by nhtsa if such tests are conducted as a manufacturer of only electric vehicles compliance with the epa labeling requirements on fuel economy is currently optional for us 

regulation—epa emissions  certificate of conformity 

the clean air act requires that we obtain a certificate of conformity issued by the epa and a california executive order issued by the california air resources board carb with respect to emissions for our vehicles the certificate of conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the clean air act’s standards and both the certificate of conformity and the executive order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the epa to utilize california standards the california standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in california are set by carb states that have adopted the california standards as approved by epa also recognize the executive order for sales of vehicles 

manufacturers who sell vehicles without a certificate of conformity may be subject to penalties of up to 37500 per violation and be required to recall and remedy any vehicles sold with emissions in excess of clean air act standards we received a certificate of conformity for sales of our tesla roadsters in 2008 and 2010 but did not receive a certificate of conformity for sales of the tesla roadster in 2009 until december 21 2009 this certificate of conformity covered sales of tesla roadsters from december 21 2009 through december 31 2009 

the epa’s selfaudit policy allows companies to selfreport violations of federal environmental laws and thereby mitigate potential penalties we reported the failure to obtain a certificate of conformity for 2009 to the epa on december 20 2009 in january 2010 we and the epa entered into an administrative settlement agreement and audit policy determination in which we agreed to pay a civil administrative penalty in the sum of 275000 the epa agreed to treat any 2009 tesla roadsters sold prior to december 21 2009 as if they were covered by a valid certificate of conformity based on our agreement to treat these vehicles as if they had been certified when sold for emissions and emissions warranty purposes the epa has closed the matter and we have been notified that it considers the violations resolved as of january 2010 all tesla roadsters we sold prior to obtaining the certificate of conformity in 2009 are now considered lawfully sold for purposes of the clean air act with no impediments to further registration use or subsequent sale 

regulation—battery safety and testing 

our battery pack conforms with mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation which includes lithiumion batteries the governing regulations which are issued by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa are based on the un recommendations on the safe transport of dangerous goods model regulations and related un manual tests and criteria the regulations vary by mode of transportation when these items are shipped such as by ocean vessel rail truck or by air 

we have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the un manual of tests and criteria including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 the cells in our battery packs are composed mainly of lithium metal oxides the cells do not contain any lead mercury cadmium or other hazardous materials heavy metals or any toxic materials in addition our battery packs include packaging for the lithiumion cells this packaging includes trace amounts of various hazardous chemicals whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs if a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge 

automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation 

state law regulates the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally requires motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed we are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in the states of california colorado florida illinois and washington and we are licensed as a motor vehicle dealer in the state of new york we are similarly licensed in the district of columbia as an ev retail store 

to the extent possible we plan to secure dealer licenses or the equivalent of a dealer license and engage in activities as a motor vehicle dealer in other states as appropriate and necessary as we open additional tesla stores some states such as texas do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer to sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer to the extent permitted by local law both the actual sale and all activities related to the sale would generally have to occur out of state in this scenario it is possible that activities related to marketing advertising taking orders taking reservations and reservation payments and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state’s motor vehicle industry laws regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities 

in jurisdictions where we do not have a tesla store a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet however some states such as kansas have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of kansas in order to sell vehicles to kansas residents such laws may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state before we sell vehicles to residents of such states in some states where we have opened a viewing “gallery” that is not a full retail location it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer laws for example the state of colorado required us to obtain dealer and manufacturer licenses in the state in order to operate our gallery in colorado although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns of this nature by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance a state could also take action against us including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities at that location in addition some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities 

  

the foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles in many states the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent particularly with respect to sales over the internet and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state how the sale transaction is structured the volume of sales into the state and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers as a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state 

california laws and potentially the laws of other states restrict the ability of licensed dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before they are available in november 2007 we became aware that the new motor vehicle board of the california department of transportation has considered whether our reservation and advertising policies comply with these laws to date we have not received any communications on this topic from the new motor vehicle board or the department of motor vehicles dmv which has the power to enforce these laws there can be no assurance that the dmv will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law we expect that if the dmv determines that we may have violated the law it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance if we are ultimately found to be in violation of california law we might be precluded from taking reservation payments and the dmv could take other actions against us including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program the dmv also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in california following a hearing on the merits which it has typically exercised only in cases of significant or repeat violations andor a refusal to comply with dmv directions 

certain states may have specific laws which apply to dealers or manufacturers selling directly to consumers or both for example the state of washington requires that reservation payments or other payment received from residents in the state of washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer consequently we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of washington in january 2010 there can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payment received from customers our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity 

furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time 

in addition to licensing laws specific laws and regulations in each of the states and their interpretation by regulators may limit or determine how we sell market advertise and otherwise solicit sales take orders take reservations and reservation payments deliver and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state while we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have tesla stores we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices 

  

competition 

competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving we believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for occupant safety and vehicle emissions technological advances in powertrain and consumer electronics components and shifting customer needs and expectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electricbased vehicles we believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology within the electricbased vehicle segment there are three primary means of powertrain electrification which will differentiate various competitors in this market 

 

  

  

 the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future prior to the introduction of the nissan leaf in december 2010 no mass produced performance highwaycapable electric vehicles were being sold in the united states in japan mitsubishi has been selling its electric imiev since april 2010 we expect additional competitors to enter the united states and europe within the next several years and as they do so we expect that we will experience significant competition with respect to our tesla roadster we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers including manufacturers of highperformance vehicles such as porsche and ferrari in addition upon the launch of our model s sedan we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive luxury sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes 

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market for example nissan introduced the nissan leaf a fully electric vehicle in december 2010 and ford has announced that it plans to introduce an electric vehicle in 2011 in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain 

  

of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles for example in december 2010 general motors introduced the chevrolet volt which is a plugin hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery 

moreover it has been reported that bmw daimler lexus audi renault and volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles several new startups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles although none of these have yet come to market finally electric vehicles have already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well 

most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do in addition almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design develop market and sell their products more effectively we believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components as well as our history of vehicle development and production are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition however we have a limited history of operations 

intellectual property 

our success depends at least in part on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of patents patent applications trade secrets including knowhow employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws trademarks intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology as of february 3 2011 we had 35 issued patents and approximately 280 pending patent applications with the united states patent and trademark office and internationally in a broad range of areas our issued patents start expiring in 2026 we intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims even if granted there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had 899 fulltime employees consisting of 213 in manufacturing 212 in powertrain research and development 121 in sales and marketing 170 in vehicle design and engineering 79 in service and 104 in general and administration of all of our employees 648 are located in our northern california offices 106 are located at our los angeles facility and 51 are located at our united kingdom offices the other employees are located in other international locations none of our employees are currently represented by labor unions or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment to date we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business and industry 

our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment 

you must consider the risks and difficulties we face as an early stage company with limited operating history if we do not successfully address these risks our business prospects operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed we were formed in july 2003 we began delivering our first performance electric vehicle the tesla roadster in early 2008 and as of december 31 2010 we had only sold approximately 1500 production vehicles to customers almost all of which were sold in the united states and europe our revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 1167 million 1119 million and 147 million respectively we have a very limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business operating results and prospects 

to date we have derived our revenues principally from sales of the tesla roadster and related sales of zero emission vehicle credits and from electric powertrain development services and sales we intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of our planned model s sedan electric vehicle which is at an early stage of development and which we do not expect to be in production until mid2012 we have no operating history with respect to the model s electric vehicle and have not yet completed the component procurement process for the model s which limits our ability to accurately forecast the cost of the vehicle in addition we only recently completed the purchase of a manufacturing facility in fremont california to produce such vehicles and we have not yet completely finalized the full vehicle design or our engineering manufacturing or component supply plans for the model s in addition as of december 31 2010 our powertrain sales development services revenue and powertrain research and development compensation have been almost entirely generated under arrangements with daimler ag daimler for the development and sale of a battery pack and charger for daimler’s smart fortwo electric drive and for the development of a battery pack for daimler’s aclass vehicle blackstar investco llc blackstar an affiliate of daimler holds more than 5 of our outstanding capital stock in october 2010 tesla and toyota motor corporation toyota entered into an agreement to develop a validated electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 toyota also purchased 2941176 shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction that occurred concurrently with the closing of our ipo we have also announced our intention for tesla to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the model s however we have not entered into any agreements with toyota for any such assistance including any purchase orders and we may never do so there are no assurances that we will be able to secure future business with daimler toyota or any of their affiliates 

it is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business for example during the four quarters of 2010 and 2009 we recorded quarterly revenue of as much as 455 million and as little as 186 million and quarterly operating losses of as much as 516 million and as little as 43 million in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 

  

in addition our revenues to date have included amounts we receive from selling zero emission vehicle zev credits to other automobile manufacturers pursuant to certain state regulations we have entered into two contracts for the sale of zev credits with two separate automotive manufacturers for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we earned revenue from the sale of zev credits of 28 million 82 million and 35 million respectively our current agreement with american honda co inc honda provides for the sale of zev credits that we earn from the sale of vehicles that we manufacture through december 31 2011 as of december 31 2010 we had sold credits for 491 vehicles under this agreement and honda has an obligation to purchase credits for up to 150 additional vehicles that tesla will manufacture prior to the expiration of the agreement we may not be able to enter into new agreements to sell any additional credits we may earn in excess of the current contractual amounts on equivalent terms and if this occurs our financial results will be harmed 

we are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of our electric vehicles specifically the tesla roadster in the near term and our future success will be dependent upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models and specifically the model s 

we currently generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our tesla roadsters and the sale of the related zev credits we began production of our tesla roadster only in 2008 and our second planned vehicle our model s is not expected to be in production until mid2012 requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction and may never be successfully developed or commercially successful there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future models of performance electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models including the model s will become commercially viable in particular it is common in the automotive industry for the production vehicle to have a styling and design different from that of the concept vehicle which may happen with the model s we believe the design of the early prototype model s is one of the key reasons why we have received approximately 3400 reservations for the vehicle as of december 31 2010 to the extent that we are not able to build the production model s to the expectations created by the early prototype and our anticipated specifications customers may cancel their reservations and our future sales could be harmed additionally historically automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently in order to meet these expectations we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models as technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology to date we have limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing and selling our electric vehicles 

we anticipate that we will experience an increase in losses and may experience a decrease in automotive sales revenues prior to the launch of the model s 

prior to the launch of our model s we anticipate our automotive sales may decline potentially significantly we currently produce the tesla roadster gliders which are partially assembled vehicles that do not contain our electric powertrain with lotus cars limited lotus in hethel england we currently intend to manufacture gliders with lotus for our current generation tesla roadster until january 2012 we intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the tesla roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted through december 31 2010 we have delivered over 1500 vehicles we do not currently plan to begin selling our next generation tesla roadster until at least one year after the launch of the model s which is expected to be in production in mid2012 as a result we anticipate that we will generate limited revenue from selling electric vehicles in 2012 until the launch of our model s the launch of our model s could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited revenues from sales of our electric vehicles the potential decrease in automotive sales revenue for the periods prior to the launch of the model s may be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition and our ability to fund operating losses could seriously constrain our growth 

  

furthermore except for our arrangements with daimler and its affiliates we do not currently have any arrangements in place with third parties for the purchase of powertrain components there are no assurances that we will be able to secure future business with daimler or its affiliates as daimler has indicated its intent to produce all of its lithiumion batteries by 2012 as part of a joint venture with evonik industries ag and has announced it has entered into a joint venture with byd auto to collaborate on the development of an electric car under a jointly owned new brand for the chinese market recently daimler has indicated that there may be an opportunity for us to continue supplying electric powertrain components including battery packs in 2012 and beyond but we have not entered into any agreements with daimler for these arrangements and we may never do so in october 2010 we and toyota entered into an agreement to develop a validated electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 although our revenues are currently limited to development services and we may not be able to enter into additional agreements with toyota in the future 

our production model for the nonpowertrain portion of the model s is unproven still evolving and is very different from the nonpowertrain portion of the production model for the tesla roadster 

our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop manufacture market and sell our planned model s electric vehicle to date our revenues have been principally derived from the sales of our tesla roadster the tesla roadster has only been produced in low volume quantities and the body is assembled by lotus in the united kingdom with the final assembly by us at our facility in menlo park california for sales destined in the united states we plan to manufacture the model s in higher volumes than our present production capabilities in our planned manufacturing facility in fremont california as a result the nonpowertrain portion of the production model for the model s will be substantially different and significantly more complex than the nonpowertrain portion of the production model for the tesla roadster in addition we plan to introduce a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques such as aluminum spot welding systems which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry our model s production model will require significant investments of cash and management resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could postpone our ability to launch or achieve full manufacturing capacity for the model s which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results and financial condition 

our production model for the model s is based on many key assumptions which may turn out to be incorrect including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 if one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect our ability to successfully launch the model s on time and on budget if at all and our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 

we have no experience to date in high volume manufacturing of our electric vehicles we do not know whether we will be able to develop efficient automated lowcost manufacturing capability and processes and reliable sources of component supply that will enable us to meet the quality price engineering design and production standards as well as the production volumes required to successfully mass market the model s even if we are successful in developing our high volume manufacturing capability and processes and reliable sources of component supply we do not know whether we will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors or in time to meet our vehicle commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers to date we have experienced minor cost increases from our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines any failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results and financial condition 

we may experience significant delays in the design manufacture launch and financing of the model s including in the build out of our model s manufacturing facility which could harm our business and prospects 

any delay in the financing design manufacture and launch of the model s including in the build out of our planned model s manufacturing facility in fremont california could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results automobile manufacturers often experience delays in the design manufacture and commercial release of new vehicle models we experienced significant delays in launching the tesla roadster we initially announced that we would begin delivering the tesla roadster in june 2007 but due to various design and production delays we did not physically deliver our first tesla roadster until february 2008 and we only achieved higher production of this vehicle in the fourth quarter of 2008 these delays resulted in additional costs and adverse publicity for our business we may experience similar delays in launching the model s and any such delays could be significant 

in addition final designs for the model s and plans for the build out of the manufacturing facility are still in process and various aspects of the model s component procurement and manufacturing plans have not yet been determined we are currently evaluating qualifying and selecting our suppliers for the planned production of the model s however we may not be able to engage suppliers for the remaining components in a timely manner at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities in addition we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that the model s is in compliance with applicable national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa safety regulations and united states environmental protection agency epa regulations prior to beginning mass production and delivery of the vehicles our plan to begin production of the model s in mid2012 is dependent upon the timely availability of funds upon our finalizing the related design engineering component procurement testing build out and manufacturing plans in a timely manner and upon our ability to execute these plans within the current timeline 

we completed the purchase of our planned manufacturing facility in fremont california in october 2010 and selected it in part because it was recently used for automobile manufacturing was located within 20 miles of 

  

our palo alto engineering facility and we believe its size may allow us to adapt our internal manufacturing plans quickly we expect that all these factors will support the timely start of production for the model s however because we have only recently acquired this facility and have just begun to implement our manufacturing plans we may experience unexpected delays in completing the build out of this facility for the production of our planned model s 

in january 2010 we entered into a loan facility with the federal financing bank ffb that is guaranteed by the doe doe loan facility our doe loan facility provides for a 4650 million loan facility under the doe’s advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program atvm program to help finance the continued development of the model s including the planned build out and operation of a manufacturing facility and to finance the planned build out and operation of our electric powertrain manufacturing facility we intend to fund the build out of the planned manufacturing facility principally by using existing cash and cash obtained through the doe loan facility our ability to draw down these funds under the doe loan facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions these draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the model s and the model s manufacturing facility if we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the doe loan facility on the timeline that we anticipate our plans for building our model s and electric powertrain manufacturing plants could be significantly delayed which would materially adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we face significant barriers in our attempt to produce our model s and if we cannot successfully overcome those barriers our business will be negatively impacted 

we face significant barriers as we attempt to produce our first mass produced vehicle our model s we currently have a drivable early prototype of the model s but do not have a full production intent prototype a final design a builtout manufacturing facility or manufacturing processes the automobile industry has traditionally been characterized by significant barriers to entry including large capital requirements investment costs of designing and manufacturing vehicles long lead times to bring vehicles to market from the concept and design stage the need for specialized design and development expertise regulatory requirements and establishing a brand name and image and the need to establish sales and service locations as a manufacturer and seller of only electric vehicles we face a variety of added challenges to entry that a traditional automobile manufacturer would not encounter including additional costs of developing and producing an electric powertrain that has comparable performance to a traditional gasoline engine in terms of range and power inexperience with servicing electric vehicles regulations associated with the transport of lithiumion batteries and unproven highvolume customer demand for fully electric vehicles in addition while we are designing the model s to have the capability to rapidly swap out its battery pack there are no specialized facilities today to perform such swapping also while we expect to be able to achieve a 300 mile range our ability to do so will depend on the feasibility and availability of appropriate battery cell technologies and improvements that we are able to achieve in reducing energy consumption while we may offer this service in the future at our stores no assurance can be provided that we will do so or that any other third party will offer such services we must successfully overcome these barriers as we move from producing the low volume tesla roadster to the model s which we plan to produce at much higher volumes if we are not able to overcome these barriers our business prospects operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed 

we have a history of losses and we expect significant increases in our costs and expenses to result in continuing losses for at least the foreseeable future 

we incurred a net loss of 1543 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and have incurred net losses of approximately 4150 million from our inception through december 31 2010 we have had net losses in each quarter since our inception we believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of the model s which is not expected to be in production until mid2012 with higher volume production not occurring until 2013 and may occur later even if we are able to successfully develop the model s there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful if we are to 

  

ever achieve profitability it will be dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of automobiles such as the model s which may not occur 

we expect the rate at which we will incur losses to increase significantly in future periods from current levels as we 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenues with respect thereto our losses in future periods will be significantly greater than the losses we would incur if we developed our business more slowly in addition we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in increases in our revenues which would further increase our losses 

in addition as of december 31 2010 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our united states net deferred tax assets as at this point we believe it is more likely than not that we will not achieve profitability and accordingly be able to use our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code although we do not believe that our initial public offering ipo would constitute an ownership change resulting in limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have not yet performed a study to determine whether such limitations exist if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred as a result of our ipo utilization of these assets could be significantly reduced 

if we are unable to adequately control the costs associated with operating our business including our costs of manufacturing sales and materials our business financial condition operating results and prospects will suffer 

if we are unable to maintain a sufficiently low level of costs for designing manufacturing marketing selling and distributing and servicing our electric vehicles relative to their selling prices our operating results gross margins business and prospects could be materially and adversely impacted we have made and will be required to continue to make significant investments for the design manufacture and sales of our electric vehicles when we first began delivering our tesla roadster in early 2008 our marginal costs of producing the tesla roadster exceeded our revenue from selling those vehicles revenue from the sales of our tesla roadster as well as from zev credits did not exceed cost of revenues related to our tesla roadster until the second quarter of 2009 there can be no assurances that our costs of producing and delivering the model s will be less than the revenue we generate from sales at the time of the model s launch or that we will achieve our expected gross margin on sales of the model s 

we incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our highperformance electric cars assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel we will also incur substantial 

  

costs in constructing and building out our model s and powertrain manufacturing facilities each of which could potentially face cost overruns or delays in construction additionally in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles including through the use of traditional media such as television radio and print even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited if we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate our operating results business and prospects will be harmed many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control for example the costs of our raw materials and components such as lithiumion battery cells or carbon fiber body panels used in our vehicles could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases indeed if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology shortages could occur which would result in increased materials costs to us 

our future growth is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles 

our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular if the market for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new rapidly evolving characterized by rapidly changing technologies price competition additional competitors evolving government regulation and industry standards frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles and specifically electric vehicles include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in addition recent reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles based on internal testing we estimate that our tesla roadster would have a 510 reduction in range when operated in 20°c temperatures to the extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain widespread acceptance our ability to market and sell our vehicles particularly in colder climates may be adversely impacted 

additionally we will become subject to regulations that require us to alter the design of our vehicles which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicles for example our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles due to concerns about overly quiet vehicles and vision impaired pedestrians in january 2011 congress passed and the president signed the pedestrian safety enhancement act of 2010 the new law requires nhtsa to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds new standards must be established by mid2012 for implementation likely by model year 2013 

the influence of any of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles which would materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and prospects 

the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time which may negatively influence potential customers’ decisions whether to purchase our vehicles 

the range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage time and charging patterns as well as other factors for example a customer’s use of their tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery’s ability to hold a charge we currently expect that our battery pack for the tesla roadster will retain approximately 6065 of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100000 miles or seven years which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range such battery deterioration and the related decrease in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles 

we are dependent upon our ability to fully draw down on our loan facility from the united states department of energy which may restrict our ability to conduct our business 

our plan for manufacturing the model s and for developing our electric powertrain facility depends on our ability to fully draw down on our doe loan facility our doe loan facility provides for a 4650 million loan facility under the doe’s atvm program to help finance the continued development of the model s including the planned build out and operation of a manufacturing facility and to finance the planned build out and operation of our electric powertrain manufacturing facility we cannot however access all of these funds at once but only over a period of up to three years through periodic draws as eligible costs are incurred through december 31 2010 we have received loans under our doe loan facility for an aggregate of 718 million our ability to draw down these funds under the doe loan facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions for the model s manufacturing facility project the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the model s and the model s manufacturing facility for the electric powertrain manufacturing facility the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components additionally the doe loan facility will require us to comply with certain operating covenants and 

  

will place additional restrictions on our ability to operate our business we are unaccustomed to managing our business with such restrictions and others that are associated with a significant credit agreement if we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the doe loan facility or our ability to make such draw downs is delayed we may need to obtain additional or alternative financing to operate our model s and electric powertrain manufacturing facilities to the extent our cash on hand is insufficient any failure to obtain the doe funds or secure other alternative funding could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects such additional or alternative financing may not be available on attractive terms if at all and could be more costly for us to obtain as a result our plans for building our model s and electric powertrain manufacturing plants could be significantly delayed which would materially adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our doe loan facility documents contain customary covenants that include among others a requirement that the project be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project compliance with all requirements of the atvm program and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness incur liens make investments or loans enter into mergers or acquisitions dispose of assets pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock prepay indebtedness pay management advisory or similar fees to affiliates enter into certain affiliate transactions enter into new lines of business and enter into certain restrictive agreements these restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and may cause us to take actions or prevent us from taking actions we believe are necessary from a competitive standpoint or that we otherwise believe are necessary to grow our business 

the operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and our customers may experience difficulty operating them properly including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking 

we have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain in certain instances these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles for example we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery in most modes of vehicle operation our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle however when the vehicle is at maximum charge the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed accordingly our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking in addition we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures in such instances the vehicle’s acceleration and speed will decrease finally if the driver permits the battery to substantially deplete its charge the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains the vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected there can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly especially in these situations any accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation result in adverse publicity and product liability claims and have a material adverse affect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition if consumers dislike these features they may choose not to buy additional cars from us which could also harm our business and prospects 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advanced diesel ethanol fuel cells or compressed natural gas or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate for example fuel which is abundant and relatively inexpensive in north america such as compressed natural gas may emerge as consumers’ preferred alternative to petroleum based propulsion any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

  

if we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology we may suffer a decline in our competitive position 

we may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and as a result may suffer a decline in our competitive position any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology as technologies change we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology in particular battery cell technology however our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles for example we do not manufacture battery cells which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs 

our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers which makes evaluating our business operating results and future prospects difficult 

our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today particularly in the united states we plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles over the internet and in companyowned tesla stores this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven especially in the united states and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires in the aggregate a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system for example we will not be able to utilize long established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume which may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results moreover we will be competing with companies with wellestablished distribution channels 

as of december 31 2010 we had opened 16 tesla stores in the united states europe and japan seven of which have been open for less than one year we have only limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our tesla stores as of december 31 2010 we had only sold approximately 1500 tesla roadsters to customers primarily in the united states and europe our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges we plan to introduce a new store concept in 2011 to enhance the customer purchasing experience and to generate greater visibility for tesla products in areas of high customer foot traffic we do not know whether our store strategy will meet our anticipated objectives and we may incur additional costs in order to improve or change this strategy 

you must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks uncertainties and difficulties we encounter as we implement our business model for instance we will need to persuade customers suppliers and regulators of the validity and sustainability of our business model we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so or to successfully address the risks uncertainties and difficulties that our business strategy faces any failure to successfully address any of the risks uncertainties and difficulties related to our business model would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

we may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

we sell our vehicles from our tesla stores as well as over the internet we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the united states as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state for example the state of texas prohibits a manufacturer from being licensed as a dealer or to act in the capacity of a dealer which would prohibit us from operating a store in the state of texas and may restrict our ability to sell vehicles to texas 

  

residents over the internet from out of state altogether without altering our sales model the state of kansas provides that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a kansas resident except through a dealer licensed to do business in the state of kansas which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of kansas in order to sell vehicles to kansas residents in some states where we have opened a “gallery” which is a location where potential customers can view our vehicles but is not a full retail location it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer laws for example the state of colorado required us to obtain dealer and manufacturer licenses in the state in order to operate our gallery in colorado in addition some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities 

the foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles in many states the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws particularly with respect to sales over the internet and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state how the sale transaction is structured the volume of sales into the state and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers as a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators the manner in which the applicable authorities will apply their state laws to our distribution model is unknown such laws as well as other laws governing the motor vehicle industry may subject us to potential inquiries and investigations from state motor vehicle regulators who may question whether our sales model complies with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws and who may require us to change our sales model or may prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states in addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws such challenges if successful could prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states 

to date we are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in california colorado florida illinois and washington and we are licensed as a motor vehicle dealer in the state of new york we have not yet sought formal clarification of our ability to sell our vehicles in any other states 

we are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in canada australia and japan and have obtained licenses to sell vehicles in other countries such as hong kong and singapore furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time 

regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles 

a large amount of our tesla roadster sales revenue has been due to the fulfillment of orders from reservations taken in prior years 

as of december 31 2010 we had sold approximately 1500 tesla roadsters to customers of which a large number were delivered in 2009 as we made a significant effort to fulfill reservations placed in prior years since 2009 we have not experienced and in the future we do not expect to have a significant wait list of orders for our tesla roadster and we may not be able to maintain or increase our vehicle sales revenue in future quarters this 

  

may be the case even though we will make significant investments to expand our network of tesla stores and sales personnel furthermore potential customers may decide to defer purchasing the tesla roadster in anticipation of our planned next generation tesla roadster or model s all reservation payments for the model s are fully refundable 

reservations for model s sedans are fully refundable to customers 

as of december 31 2010 we had unfilled reservations for approximately 3400 model s sedans all of which are subject to cancellation by the customer up until such time that the customer enters into a purchase agreement historically all of our reservations have been refundable and we have had a significant number of customers who submitted reservations for the tesla roadster cancel those reservations and we have refunded their deposits 

given the long lead times that we have historically experienced between customer reservation and delivery on the tesla roadster and that we expect to experience on the model s there is a heightened risk that customers that have made reservations may not ultimately take delivery on vehicles due to potential changes in customer preferences competitive developments and other factors for example when we delayed the introduction of the original tesla roadster in the fall of 2007 we experienced a significant number of customers that cancelled their reservations and requested the return of their reservation payment if we encounter delays in the introduction of the model s we believe that a significant number of our customers could similarly cancel their reservations as a result no assurance can be made that reservations will not be cancelled and will ultimately result in the final purchase delivery and sale of the vehicle such cancellations could harm our financial condition business prospects and operating results 

if we are unable to design develop market and sell new electric vehicles and services that address additional market opportunities our business prospects and operating results will suffer 

we may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles and services address new market segments or develop a significantly broader customer base to date we have focused our business on the sale of highperformance electric vehicles and have targeted relatively affluent consumers we will need to address additional markets and expand our customer demographic in order to further grow our business in particular we intend the model s to appeal to the customers of premium vehicles which is a much larger and different demographic from that of the tesla roadster successfully offering a vehicle in this vehicle class requires delivering a vehicle with a higher standard of fit and finish in the interior and exterior than currently exists in the tesla roadster at a price that is competitive with other premium vehicles we have not completed the design component sourcing or manufacturing process for the model s so it is difficult to forecast its eventual cost manufacturability or quality therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to deliver a vehicle that is ultimately competitive in the premium vehicle market in 2011 we publicly announced the tesla model x as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform we have also previously announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle which we expect to produce at our planned manufacturing facility in fremont california after the introduction of the model s however we have not yet finalized the design engineering or component sourcing plans for these vehicles and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring these vehicles to market at a lower price point and in higher volumes than our planned model s as we currently intend if at all our failure to address additional market opportunities would harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

any changes to the federal trade commission’s electric vehicle range testing procedure or the united states environmental protection agency’s energy consumption regulations for electric vehicles could result in a reduction to the advertised range of our vehicles which could negatively impact our sales and harm our business 

the federal trade commission ftc requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle’s window the ftc specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by 

  

the society of automotive engineers sae which further requires that we test using the epa’s combined city and highway testing cycles the epa recently announced that it would develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles based on initial indications from the epa we believe it is likely that the epa will modify its testing cycles in a manner that when applied to our vehicles could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles by up to 30 as compared to the combined twocycle test currently applicable to our vehicles however there can be no assurance that the modified epa testing cycles will not result in a greater reduction to the extent that the ftc adopts these procedures in place of the current procedures from the sae this could impair our ability to advertise the tesla roadster as a vehicle that is capable of going in excess of 200 miles moreover such changes could impair our ability to deliver the model s with the initially advertised range which could result in the cancellation of a number of the approximately 3400 reservations that have been placed for the model s as of december 31 2010 any reduction in the advertised range of our vehicles could negatively impact our vehicle sales and harm our business 

we have no experience with using common platforms in the design and manufacture of our vehicles 

if we are unable to effectively leverage the benefits of using an adaptable platform architecture our business prospects operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected we intend to design the model s with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of the model s to create future electric vehicles including as examples a crossoversport utility vehicle a van and a cabriolet in 2011 we publicly announced the tesla model x as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform however we have no experience with using common platforms in the design and manufacture of our vehicles and the design of the model s is not complete we may make changes to the design of the model s that may make it more difficult to use the model s platform for future electric vehicles there are no assurances that we will be able to use the model s platform to bring future vehicle models including the model x to market faster or more inexpensively by leveraging use of this common platform or that there will be sufficient customer demand for the model x or additional vehicle variants of this platform 

the automotive market is highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in this industry we currently face competition from established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future 

the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future some of our competitors entered the market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter these markets within the next several years and as they do so we expect that we will experience significant competition with respect to our tesla roadster we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers including manufacturers of highperformance vehicles such as porsche and ferrari in addition upon the launch of our model s sedan we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive luxury sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes 

many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market in japan mitsubishi has been selling its electric imiev since april 2010 in december 2010 nissan introduced the nissan leaf a fully electric vehicle and ford has announced that it plans to introduce an electric vehicle in 2011 in addition several manufacturers including general motors toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicles and certain of these manufacturers have announced plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles for example in december 2010 general motors introduced the chevrolet volt which is a plugin hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery 

moreover it has been reported that bmw daimler lexus audi renault and volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles several new startups have also announced plans to enter the market for 

  

performance electric vehicles although none of these have yet come to market finally electric vehicles have already been brought to market in china and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the united states market as well 

most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do in addition almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design develop market and sell their products more effectively 

furthermore certain large manufacturers offer financing and leasing options on their vehicles and also have the ability to market vehicles at a substantial discount provided that the vehicles are financed through their affiliated financing company we only began offering a leasing program in february 2010 which is currently only available to qualified customers in the united states we do not currently offer or plan to offer any form of direct financing on our vehicles we have not in the past and do not currently offer customary discounts on our vehicles the lack of our direct financing options and the absence of customary vehicle discounts could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry factors affecting competition include product quality and features innovation and development time pricing reliability safety fuel economy customer service and financing terms increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and prospects our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets if our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality price or performance of our cars or services we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile 

volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition the markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods for example according to automotive industry sources sales of passenger vehicles in north america during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30 lower than those during the same period in the prior year demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general economic political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies as a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand as our business grows economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we sell our electric vehicles will impact our business prospects and operating results as well demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives prices of raw materials and parts and components cost of fuel and governmental regulations including tariffs import regulation and other taxes volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results these effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers 

  

difficult economic conditions may affect consumer purchases of luxury items such as our performance electric vehicles 

over the last few years the deterioration in the global financial markets and continued challenging condition of the macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted consumer spending and we believe has adversely affected the sales of our tesla roadster the automobile industry in particular was severely impacted by the poor economic conditions and several vehicle manufacturing companies including general motors and chrysler were forced to file for bankruptcy sales of new automobiles generally have dropped during this recessionary period sales of highend and luxury consumer products such as our performance electric vehicles depend in part on discretionary consumer spending and are even more exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions difficult economic conditions could therefore temporarily reduce the market for vehicles in our price range discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors including changes in tax rates and tax credits interest rates and the availability and terms of consumer credit 

if the current difficult economic conditions continue or worsen we may experience a decline in the demand for our tesla roadster or reservations for our model s either of which could materially harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results accordingly any events that have a negative effect on the united states economy or on foreign economies or that negatively affect consumer confidence in the economy including disruptions in credit and stock markets and actual or perceived economic slowdowns may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to the seasonality of our business and fluctuations in our operating costs 

our operating results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to many factors including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles demand for new cars in the automobile industry in general and for highperformance sports vehicles such as the tesla roadster in particular typically decline over the winter season while sales are generally higher as compared to the winter season during the spring and summer months we expect sales of the tesla roadster to fluctuate on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters we note that in general automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of the model s and other models we introduce may have similar seasonality however our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business also any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue 

we also expect our periodtoperiod operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we among other things design develop and manufacture our planned model s and electric powertrain components build and equip new manufacturing facilities to produce the model s and electric powertrain components open new tesla stores with maintenance and repair capabilities incur costs for warranty repairs or product recalls if any increase our sales and marketing activities and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations 

as a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance moreover our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors if this occurs the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time 

marketplace confidence in our longterm business prospects is important for building and maintaining our business 

if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence about our business prospects among consumers and within our industry then our financial condition operating results and business prospects may suffer materially 

  

our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support if we were to cease or cut back operations even years from now buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support as a result consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed for example during the economic downturn of 2008 we had difficulty raising the necessary funding for our operations and as a result in the fourth quarter of 2008 we had to lay off approximately 60 employees and curtail our expansion plans in addition during this period a number of customers canceled their previously placed reservations if we are required to take similar actions in the future such actions may result in negative perceptions regarding our longterm business prospects 

accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers and other parties in our liquidity and longterm business prospects in contrast to some more established auto makers we believe that in our case the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed 

we may need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

the design manufacture sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business since inception through december 31 2010 we had incurred net losses of approximately 4150 million and had used approximately 3306 million of cash in operations and while recognizing only approximately 2435 million in revenue as of december 31 2010 we had 996 million in cash and cash equivalents which excludes the 736 million in restricted cash we have set aside principally to fund the dedicated account under the provisions of our doe loan facility we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents cash held in our doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility together with our anticipated cash from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations through the initial customer deliveries of the model s however if there are delays in the launch of the model s if we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the doe loan facility or if the costs in building our model s and powertrain manufacturing facilities exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions this capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations continue research development and design efforts including those for our planned model x vehicle establish sales and service centers improve infrastructure such as expanded battery assembly facilities and to make the 

  

investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce the model s we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially adversely affected for example during the economic downturn of 2008 we had difficulty raising the necessary funding for our operations and as a result in the fourth quarter of 2008 we had to lay off approximately 60 employees and curtail our expansion plans additionally under our doe loan facility we face restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and in the future may need to obtain a waiver from the doe in order to do so we may not be able to obtain such waiver from the doe which may harm our business future issuance of equity or equityrelated securities will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and our issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of our company 

if our vehicles fail to perform as expected our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed 

our vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair for example our vehicles use a substantial amount of software code to operate software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the longterm performance of our tesla roadster we have no frame of reference by which to evaluate our model s upon which our business prospects depend there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers we experienced product recalls in may 2009 and october 2010 both of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain in may 2009 we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider which is the partially assembled tesla roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain in october 2010 we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle although the cost of the most recent recall was not material we may experience additional recalls in the future which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets and could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations our electric vehicles including the tesla roadster and model s may not perform consistent with customers’ expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available for example our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity lost revenue delivery delays product recalls product liability claims harm to our brand and reputation and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

we have very limited experience servicing our vehicles and we are using a different service model from the one typically used in the industry if we are unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected in addition we anticipate the level and quality of the service we provide our tesla roadster customers will have a direct impact on the success of the model s and our future vehicles if we are unable to satisfactorily service our tesla roadster customers our ability to generate customer loyalty grow our business and sell additional tesla roadsters as well as model s sedans could be impaired 

we have very limited experience servicing our vehicles as of december 31 2010 we had sold only approximately 1500 tesla roadsters to customers primarily in the united states and europe we do not plan to begin production of any model s vehicles until mid2012 with higher volume production not occurring until 

  

2013 and do not have any experience servicing these cars as they do not exist currently servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills including high voltage training and servicing techniques 

we plan to service our performance electric vehicles through our companyowned tesla stores and through our mobile service technicians known as the tesla rangers as of december 31 2010 we had opened 16 tesla stores most of which are equipped to actively service our performance electric vehicles however seven stores have been open for less than one year and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles through our tesla stores going forward we intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets but to date have limited experience with separate sales and service locations within a geographic market we will need to open additional tesla stores with service capabilities and standalone service locations as well as hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these centers and act as tesla rangers in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles we only implemented our tesla rangers program in october 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers’ vehicles there can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirement in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases 

we do not expect to be able to open tesla stores in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside in order to address the service needs of customers that are not in geographical proximity to our service centers we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile tesla rangers to service the vehicles at the customer’s location these special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers in addition a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network if we do not adequately address our customers’ service needs our brand and reputation will be adversely affected which in turn could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

traditional automobile manufacturers do not provide maintenance and repair services directly consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers we do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles at this point we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future as our vehicles are placed in more locations we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales thereby harming our business and prospects 

in addition the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain while we believe our tesla ranger program and our practice of shipping customers’ vehicles to our nearest tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in these circumstances without seeking formal regulatory guidance there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states further certain state franchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service if issues arise in connection with these laws certain aspects of tesla’s service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law which may harm our business 

  

we may not succeed in continuing to establish maintain and strengthen the tesla brand which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business revenues and prospects 

our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand any failure to develop maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the tesla roadster and planned electric vehicles including the model s and sell our electric powertrain components if we do not continue to establish maintain and strengthen our brand we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and repair services and we have very limited experience in these areas in addition we expect that our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts to date we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand to further promote our brand we may be required to change our marketing practices which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses including the need to use traditional media such as television radio and print the automobile industry is intensely competitive and we may not be successful in building maintaining and strengthening our brand many of our current and potential competitors particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in detroit japan and the european union have greater name recognition broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do if we do not develop and maintain a strong brand our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 

we are dependent upon our relationship with lotus for the manufacturing of the tesla roadster 

in july 2005 we entered into a supply agreement with lotus which was amended in march 2010 pursuant to which lotus agreed to assist with the design and manufacture of our tesla roadster although we complete the final assembly of our tesla roadster in our menlo park facility for vehicles destined for the united states market currently we are dependent upon lotus to complete the initial portion of the assembly process of the tesla roadster for us in hethel england and we expect this to continue until we discontinue sales of our current generation tesla roadster the partially assembled vehicles manufactured by lotus do not contain our electric powertrain and are referred to as gliders we currently intend to manufacture gliders with lotus for our current generation tesla roadster until january 2012 we intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the tesla roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted accordingly we intend to offer a limited number of tesla roadsters for sale in 2012 we anticipate that our next generation tesla roadster which we plan to launch at least one year after we begin production of the model s will be manufactured in our own facilities 

pursuant to the supply agreement with lotus we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 2400 partially assembled or fully assembled vehicles over the term of the agreement if we are unable to meet this volume requirement we are still responsible for payment to lotus of the lesser of i the sum of lotus’ actual incurred costs and an agreed upon profit margin per vehicle up to the minimum volume requirement or ii £5400000 to the extent we would like to produce more than the number of vehicles that we have contracted for we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with lotus but may be unable to do so on terms and conditions favorable to us if at all in such event we may be required to contract with another third party to replace lotus which would entail redesign of the tesla roadster chassis adjustments to our supply chain and establishment of a light manufacturing facility the expense and time required to complete this transition and to assure that the vehicles and gliders manufactured at that facility comply with all relevant regulatory requirements may turn out to be higher than anticipated entry into any such contract with another third party might also require us to agree to terms with lotus on which lotus would license certain intellectual property rights necessary for the manufacture of the tesla roadster to such third party there can be no assurance that we will be able to find a third party to complete partial manufacture of the tesla roadster on terms favorable to us if at all in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into an intellectual property rights 

  

license with lotus on terms favorable to us if at all additionally because we are dependent upon our relationship with lotus for the manufacturing of the tesla roadster our business depends on lotus continuing to operate as a viable and solvent entity and to continue to produce the tesla roadster vehicles and gliders pursuant to our supply agreement any delay or discontinuance by lotus of delivery of the tesla roadster vehicles and gliders or failure by lotus to produce the vehicles and gliders in accordance with quality standards would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results and financial condition 

we are dependent on our suppliers a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to continue to deliver or their refusal to deliver necessary components of our vehicles at prices and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and operating results 

the tesla roadster uses over 2000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 150 suppliers many of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components while we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source we refer to these component suppliers as our single source suppliers to date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain longterm agreements with our single source suppliers 

while we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us in particular while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for almost all of our single sourced components on a relatively short time frame qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of the tesla roadster such as the carbon fiber body panels which are supplied to us by sotira 35 a unit of sora composites group may be time consuming and costly 

in addition lotus is the only manufacturer for certain components such as the chassis of our tesla roadster we therefore refer to it as a sole source supplier replacing the components from lotus that are sole sourced may require us to reengineer our vehicles which would be time consuming and costly we do not currently utilize any sole source suppliers other than lotus 

this supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the tesla roadster our powertrain component sales activities and the planned model s we are currently evaluating qualifying and selecting our suppliers for the planned production of the model s and we intend to establish dual suppliers for several key components of the model s although we expect that a number of components for the model s will be single sourced we have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains which have caused delays in our production process and we may experience additional delays in the future 

changes in business conditions wars governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis furthermore if we experience significant increased demand or need to replace our existing suppliers there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us at all or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner in the past we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially adversely affect our business prospects and operating results 

changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost and delay for example a change in our supplier for our carbon fiber body panels contributed to the delay in our 

  

ability to ramp our production of the tesla roadster a failure by our suppliers to provide the components necessary to manufacture our performance electric vehicles could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results in addition since we have no fixed pricing arrangements with any of our component suppliers other than lotus our component suppliers could increase their prices with little or no notice to us which could harm our financial condition and operating results if we are unable to pass such price increases along to our customers 

increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials in particular lithiumion cells could harm our business 

we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials any such an increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel nickel carbon fiber nonferrous metals such as copper as well as cobalt the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results for instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for lithiumion cells these risks include 

 

  

  

 our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles and for the battery pack we produce for other automobile manufacturers while we believe several sources of the battery cell we have selected for the tesla roadster are available we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in the tesla roadster the same is also true for the battery cells used for battery packs that we supply to other oems any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the tesla roadster and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified moreover battery cell manufacturers may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe furthermore current fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices there can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices we have also already announced an estimated price for the base model of our planned model s but do not anticipate announcing the final pricing of the other variants of the model s until at least 2011 however any attempts to increase the announced or expected prices in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by our customers result in cancellations of model s reservations and could materially adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems if these implementations are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed 

we are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems to assist us in the management of our business in particular our production of the model s will necessitate the improvement design and development of more expanded supply chain systems to support our operations as well as production and shop floor management the implementation of new software management platforms and the addition of these platforms at new locations require significant management time support and cost moreover there are 

  

inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems including supply chain disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain supplies when needed or to deliver vehicles to our tesla stores and customers we cannot be sure that these expanded systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis if at all if we do not successfully implement this project our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed in addition the new systems may not operate as we expect them to and we may be required to expend significant resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions 

if our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products the vehicle may not operate properly which could harm our business 

automobile enthusiasts may seek to “hack” our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems also we are aware of customers who have customized their vehicles with aftermarket parts that may compromise driver safety for example some customers have installed seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised other customers have changed wheels and tires while others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle we have not tested nor do we endorse such changes or products in addition customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customer to injury from high voltage electricity such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

the success of our business depends on attracting and retaining a large number of customers if we are unable to do so we will not be able to achieve profitability 

our success depends on attracting a large number of potential customers to purchase our electric vehicles as of december 31 2010 we had sold approximately 1500 tesla roadsters to customers almost all of which were sold in the united states and europe and had accepted reservations for approximately 3400 model s sedans if our existing and prospective customers do not perceive our vehicles and services to be of sufficiently high value and quality cost competitive and appealing in aesthetics or performance or if the final production version of the model s is not sufficiently similar to the drivable design prototype we may not be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers and our business and prospects operating results and financial condition would suffer as a result in addition because our performance electric vehicles to date have been sold largely through word of mouth marketing efforts we may be required to incur significantly higher and more sustained advertising and promotional expenditures than we have previously incurred to attract customers and use more traditional advertising techniques in addition if we engage in traditional advertising we may face review by consumer protection enforcement agencies and may incur significant expenses to ensure that our advertising claims are fully supported to date we have limited experience selling our electric vehicles and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining a large number of customers for example a significant number of our stores have been open for less than one year and a portion of our sales team come from backgrounds other than automotive if for any of these reasons we are not able to attract and maintain customers our business prospects operating results and financial condition would be materially harmed 

regulators could review our practice of taking reservation payments and if the practice is deemed to violate applicable law we could be required to pay penalties or refund the reservation payments that we have received for vehicles that are not immediately available for delivery to stop accepting additional reservation payments to restructure certain aspects of our reservation program and potentially to suspend or revoke our licenses to manufacture and sell our vehicles 

we have not yet commenced production of our model s sedan which we currently plan for mid2012 for customers interested in reserving the model s we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least 5000 as of december 31 2010 we had collected reservation payments for model s sedans in an aggregate 

  

amount of 283 million at this time we do not plan to hold reservation payments separately or in an escrow or trust fund or pay any interest on reservation payments except to the extent applicable state laws require us to do so we generally use these funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

california laws and potentially the laws of other states restrict the ability of licensed auto dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before the vehicles are available to the dealer from the manufacturer in november 2007 we became aware that the new motor vehicle board of the california department of transportation has considered whether our reservation policies and advertising comply with the california vehicle code to date we have not received any communications on this topic from the new motor vehicle board or the department of motor vehicles dmv which has the power to enforce these laws there can be no assurance that the dmv will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law we expect that if the dmv determines that we may have violated the law it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance if we are ultimately found to be in violation of california law we might be precluded from taking reservation payments and the dmv could take other actions against us including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program in addition california is currently the only jurisdiction in which we have licenses to both manufacture and sell our vehicles so any limitation imposed on our operations in california may be particularly damaging to our business the dmv also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in california following a hearing on the merits which it has typically exercised in cases of significant or repeat violations andor a refusal to comply with dmv directions 

certain states may have specific laws which apply to reservation payments accepted by dealers or manufacturers selling directly to consumers or both for example the state of washington requires that reservation payments or other payments received from residents in the state of washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer consequently we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of washington in january 2010 there can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payments received from customers our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity 

furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles accordingly there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time if our vehicle reservation or advertising practices or other business practices were found to violate the laws of a jurisdiction we may face exposure under those laws and our business and prospects would be adversely affected for example if we are required to return reservation payment amounts we may need to raise additional funds to make such payments there can be no assurance that such funding would be available on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms if at all if a court were to find that our reservation agreement or advertising does not comply with state laws we may face exposure under those laws which may include exposure under consumer protection statutes such as those that deal with unfair competition and false advertising moreover reductions in our cash as a result of redemptions or an inability to take reservation payments could also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing the prospect of reductions in cash even if unrealized may also make it more difficult to obtain financing 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles in addition we may not be able to open stores in certain states 

our plan to expand our network of tesla stores will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles this planned global expansion of tesla stores may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our 

  

brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore there can be no assurances that we will be able to construct additional storefronts on the budget or timeline we have established we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale of our vehicles in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delays in expanding our network of tesla stores this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results as of december 31 2010 we had opened 16 tesla stores in major metropolitan areas throughout the united states europe and japan we plan to open additional stores during 2011 with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection with the planned model s rollout however we may not be able to expand our network at such rate and our planned expansion of our network of tesla stores will require significant cash investment and management resources as well as efficiency in the execution of establishing these storefronts and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell our vehicles 

furthermore certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that may preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sales in such jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects and operating results 

we recently began to offer a leasing alternative to customers which exposes us to risks commonly associated with the prolonged ownership of vehicles and the extension of consumer credit 

we began offering a leasing alternative to customers of our tesla roadster in the united states market in february 2010 through our wholly owned subsidiary tesla motors leasing inc during the latter half of 2010 we began offering a leasing alternative in canada through our canadian subsidiary under our program we currently permit qualifying customers to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we retain responsibility for the timely collection of payments from our customers and are therefore exposed to the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms 

as we retain ownership of the vehicle and customers have the option of returning the vehicle to us after the lease is complete we also are exposed to the risk that the vehicles’ residual value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates currently there is only a very limited secondary market for our electric vehicles in particular and electric vehicles in general on which to base our estimates and such a secondary market may not develop in the future our credit losses could exceed our expectations or our residual value and return volume estimates could prove to be adversely incorrect either of which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

we face risks associated with our international operations including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions which could harm our business 

we face risks associated with our international operations including possible unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions which could harm our business we currently have international operations and subsidiaries in australia canada denmark france germany hong kong italy japan monaco singapore switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom that are subject to the legal political regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions additionally as part of our growth strategy we intend to expand our sales maintenance and repair services internationally however we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles internationally and such expansion would require us to make significant expenditures including the hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face the risk that costs denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar a portion of our costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were denominated in foreign currencies such as the british pound and the euro this is primarily due to the contract with lotus in the united kingdom to assemble the tesla roadster vehicles and gliders and other parts sourced in europe in addition our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses denominated in foreign currencies principally in the british pound the euro and the japanese yen if the value of the united states dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in united states dollars will correspondingly increase and our operating results will be adversely affected in addition our battery cell purchases from asian suppliers are subject to currency risk although our present contracts are united states dollar based if the united states dollar depreciates significantly against the local currency it could cause our asian suppliers to significantly raise their prices which could harm our financial results 

if we fail to successfully address these risks our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 

the unavailability reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

any reduction elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular this could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative fuel vehicles generally and performance electric vehicles specifically for example in december 2009 we finalized an arrangement with the california alternative energy and advanced 

  

transportation financing authority that will result in an exemption from california state sales and use taxes for up to 320 million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sales and use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately 31 million over a three year period starting in december 2009 this exemption is only available for equipment that would otherwise be subject to california sales and use taxes and that would be used only for the following three purposes to establish our production facility for the model s sedan to upgrade our palo alto powertrain production facility and to expand our current tesla roadster assembly operations at our menlo park facility if we fail to meet these conditions we would be unable to take full advantage of this tax incentive and our financial position could be harmed 

in addition certain regulations that encourage sales of electric cars could be reduced eliminated or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect against our vehicles either currently or at any time in the future for example while the federal and state governments have from time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel cars our competitors have more experience and greater resources in working with legislators than we do and so there is no guarantee that our vehicles would be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to alternative fuel vehicles in the future this would put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage as another example government disincentives have been enacted in europe for gaspowered vehicles which discourage the use of such vehicles and allow us to set a higher sales price for the tesla roadster in europe in the event that such disincentives are reduced or eliminated sales of electric vehicles including our tesla roadster could be adversely affected furthermore low volume manufacturers are exempt from certain regulatory requirements in the united states and the european union this provides us with an advantage over high volume manufacturers that must comply with such regulations once we reach a certain threshold number of sales in each of the united states and the european union we will no longer be able to take advantage of such exemptions in the respective jurisdictions which could lead us to incur additional design and manufacturing expense we do not anticipate that we will be able to take advantage of these exemptions with respect to the model s which we plan to produce at significantly higher volumes than the tesla roadster 

if we are unable to grow our sales of electric vehicle components to original equipment manufacturers our financial results may suffer in addition if daimler proceeds with its plans to produce all of its lithiumion batteries by 2012 as part of a joint venture with evonik industries ag we are likely to lose a significant customer of our powertrain business 

we may have trouble attracting and retaining powertrain customers which could adversely affect our business prospects and results daimler and its affiliates and toyota are currently the only customers of our electric powertrain sales and development services in may 2009 we formalized a development agreement with daimler as a result of which we performed specified research and development services in addition we have been selected by daimler to supply it with up to 1800 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo electric drive in at least five european cities we began shipping the first of these battery packs and chargers in november 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 in the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 and we entered into a formal agreement for this arrangement in may 2010 there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure future business with daimler or its affiliates as it has indicated its intent to produce all of its lithiumion batteries by 2012 as part of a joint venture with evonik industries ag and has announced it has entered into a joint venture with byd auto to collaborate on the development of an electric car under a jointly owned new brand for the chinese market if daimler goes through with its production plans with evonik we are likely to lose this portion of our powertrain sales recently daimler has indicated that there may be an opportunity for us to continue supplying electric powertrain components including battery packs in 2012 and beyond but we have not entered into any agreements with daimler for these arrangements and we may never do so in october 2010 we and toyota entered into an agreement to develop a validated electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 however we may not be able to enter into additional agreements with toyota in the future other than our agreements with daimler and toyota we have no significant development or sales agreements in place to drive 

  

our electric powertrain revenues even if we do develop such relationships there is no assurance that we can adequately pursue such opportunities simultaneously with the execution of our plans for our vehicles 

our relationship with daimler is subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects 

daimler has agreed to purchase components of our electric powertrain to support a trial of the smart fortwo electric drive in at least five european cities and a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe in addition we are negotiating agreements for daimler to provide us with access to various parts automotive support and engineering for the model s and regarding various other areas of strategic cooperation with daimler although there are no assurances that we will be able to enter into any such agreements however our relationship with daimler poses various risks to us including 

 

  

  

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

in addition our exclusivity and intellectual property agreement or eip agreement with daimler north america corporation dnac an affiliate of daimler provides that if a daimler competitor offers to enter into a competitive strategic transaction with us we are required to give dnac notice of such offer and dnac will have a specified period of time in which to notify us whether it wishes to enter into such transaction with us on the same terms as offered by the third party because we will be able to enter into such a transaction with a third party only if dnac declines to do so this may decrease the likelihood that we will receive offers from third parties to enter into strategic arrangements in the future 

our relationship with toyota is subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects 

in october 2010 we and toyota entered into an agreement to develop a validated electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 we have also previously announced our intention for tesla to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the model s however we have not entered into any agreements with toyota for any such assistance or for any commercial supply and we may never do so there are no assurances we will be able to enter into any further agreements with toyota for a longterm supply of electric powertrains for the toyota rav4 or any other vehicles 

we may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities or form strategic relationships in the future 

strategic business relationships will be an important factor in the growth and success of our business for example our strategic relationship with daimler has provided us with various benefits and we have recently entered into an agreement to develop a validated electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with toyota however there are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationship opportunities in the future or our competitors may capitalize on such opportunities before we do our strategic relationship with daimler involved blackstar an affiliate of daimler making a significant equity investment in us as well as a representative from daimler dr herbert kohler joining our board in addition toyota made a significant equity investment in us concurrent with the closing of our ipo in july 2010 we may not be able to 

  

offer similar benefits to other companies that we would like to establish and maintain strategic relationships with which could impair our ability to establish such relationships moreover identifying such opportunities could demand substantial management time and resources and negotiating and financing relationships involves significant costs and uncertainties if we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic relationship opportunities in the future our overall growth could be impaired and our business prospects and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to manage future growth effectively we may not be able to market and sell our vehicles successfully 

any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we have recently expanded our operations significantly increasing our total number of employees from 268 as of december 31 2007 to 899 as of december 31 2010 and further significant expansion will be required especially in connection with the planned establishment of our model s manufacturing facility our electric powertrain manufacturing facility the expansion of our network of tesla stores and service centers our mobile tesla rangers program and requirements of being a public company our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully risks that we face in undertaking this expansion include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel including design and manufacturing personnel and service technicians for our performance electric vehicles because our highperformance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines individuals with sufficient training in performance electric vehicles may not be available to hire and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire competition for individuals with experience designing manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense and we may not be able to attract assimilate train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future the failure to attract integrate train motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business and prospects 

if we are unable to attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management technical and vehicle engineering personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results in particular we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of directors and jb straubel our chief technical officer none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team in addition we do not have “key person” life insurance 

  

policies covering any of our officers or other key employees there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer 

we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman of our board of directors and largest stockholder while mr musk has historically provided a significant amount of the funds required for our operations we have not received any funding from mr musk since march 2009 and are no longer dependent on the financial resources of mr musk to fund our expected growth given the funds available under doe loan facility and the proceeds from our ipo and private placements although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serves as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technologies a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and chairman of solarcity a solar equipment installation company 

in addition our financing agreements with blackstar contain certain covenants relating to mr musk’s employment as our chief executive officer these covenants provide that if mr musk is not serving as our chief executive officer at any time until the later of december 31 2012 or the launch of the model s mr musk shall promptly propose a successor chief executive officer and dr kohler or his successor must consent to any appointment of such person by our board of directors if at any time during the period from january 1 2011 through december 31 2012 mr musk is not serving as either our chief executive officer or chairman of our board of directors for reasons other than his death or disability and dr kohler or his successor has not consented to the appointment of a new chief executive officer or if during such period mr musk renders services to or invests in any other automotive oem other than us daimler has the right to terminate any or all of its strategic collaboration agreements with us if this were to occur our business would be harmed 

furthermore our doe loan facility provides that we will be in default under the facility in the event mr musk and certain of his affiliates fail to own at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to the model s at least 65 of the capital stock held by mr musk and such affiliates as of the date of the doe loan facility mr musk’s shares of our capital stock are held directly by his personal trust mr musk is currently engaged in divorce proceedings and previously entered into a postnuptial agreement which provides that the holdings of the trust including mr musk’s shares of our capital stock shall remain solely his property this postnuptial agreement has been upheld by the superior court of los angeles though such decision may be subject to an appeal however we do not believe that the divorce proceedings will result in mr musk owning less than 65 of the capital stock held by him as of the date of the doe loan facility or otherwise result in a material reduction of mr musk’s holdings of our capital stock we do not expect the divorce proceedings to have a material impact on mr musk’s ability to serve as our chief executive officer and chairman we also do not believe that mr musk would have to liquidate a significant percentage of his holdings in order to satisfy any settlement reached in connection with such proceedings 

many members of our management team are new to the company or to the automobile industry and execution of our business plan and development strategy could be seriously harmed if integration of our management team into our company is not successful 

our business could be seriously harmed if integration of our management team into our company is not successful we expect that it will take time for our new management team to integrate into our company and it is too early to predict whether this integration will be successful we have recently experienced significant changes in our management team and expect to continue to experience significant growth in our management team our senior management team has only limited experience working together as a group specifically three of the six members of our senior management team have joined us within the last two years for example gilbert passin our vice president of manufacturing joined us in january 2010 george blankenship our vice president of 

  

sales and customer experience joined us in july 2010 and eric whitaker our general counsel joined us in october 2010 this lack of longterm experience working together may impact the team’s ability to collectively quickly and efficiently respond to problems and effectively manage our business although we are taking steps to add senior management personnel that have significant automotive experience many of the members of our current senior management team have limited or no prior experience in the automobile or electric vehicle industries 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building our manufacturing facilities 

as an automobile manufacturer we and our operations both in the united states and abroad are subject to national state provincial andor local environmental laws and regulations including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business these laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs cleanup costs property damage bodily injury and fines and penalties capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties third party damages suspension of production or a cessation of our operations 

contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by us as well as at properties we will own and operate and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations including but not limited to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla which can impose liability for the full amount of remediationrelated costs without regard to fault for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results we may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws in connection with our planned manufacturing facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and delay our ability to operate these facilities which would adversely impact our business prospects and operating results 

new united motor manufacturing inc nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at the fremont site which affect soil and groundwater and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues at the fremont site we cannot currently determine with certainty the total potential costs to remediate preexisting contamination and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of any environmental contamination at the fremont site 

as the owner of the fremont site we may be responsible under federal and state laws and regulations for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the fremont site whether it occurred before or after the date we purchase the property we have reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions remediation activities and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing 

on the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on the remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we 

  

are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability including attorney fees or any costs or penalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental conditions and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement 

there are no assurances that nummi will perform its obligations under our agreement and nummi’s failure to perform would require us to undertake these obligations at a potentially significant cost and risk to our ability to build equip and operate our planned model s facility at the fremont site any remediation activities or other environmental conditions at the fremont site could harm our operations and the future use and value of the fremont site and could delay our production plans for the model s 

we may not be able to obtain or to agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government grants loans and other incentives for which we have applied and may in the future apply as a result our business and prospects may be adversely affected 

we have applied for federal and state grants loans and tax incentives under government programs designed to stimulate the economy and support the production of electric vehicles and related technologies we anticipate that in the future there will be new opportunities for us to apply for grants loans and other incentives from the united states state and foreign governments our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under applicable government programs and approval of our applications to participate in such programs the application process for these funds and other incentives is and will be highly competitive we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining any of these additional grants loans and other incentives if we are not successful in obtaining any of these additional incentives and we are unable to find alternative sources of funding to meet our planned capital needs our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our business may be adversely affected by union activities 

although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages as we expand our business to include full inhouse manufacturing of our vehicles as is planned for the model s there can be no assurances that our employees will not join or form a labor union or that we will not be required to become a union signatory we recently purchased an existing automobile production facility in fremont california from nummi prior employees of nummi were union members and our future work force at this facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union we are also directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results for example certain employees at the sea freight companies through which we ship our tesla roadster gliders to the united states after assembly in england may be represented by unions as may be employees at certain of our suppliers if a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition 

we are subject to substantial regulation which is evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results 

our performance electric vehicles the sale of motor vehicles in general and the electronic components used in our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws we have incurred and expect to incur in the future significant costs in complying with these regulations for example the clean air act requires that we obtain a certificate of conformity issued by the epa and a california executive order issued by the california air resources board with respect to emissions for our vehicles we received a 

  

certificate of conformity for sales of our tesla roadsters in 2008 and 2010 but did not receive a certificate of conformity for sales of the tesla roadster in 2009 until december 21 2009 in january 2010 we and the epa entered into an administrative settlement agreement and audit policy determination in which we agreed to pay a civil administrative penalty in the sum of 275000 for failing to obtain a certificate of conformity for sales of our vehicles in 2009 prior to december 21 2009 

regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition as the automotive industry moves towards greater use of electronics for vehicle systems nhtsa and other regulatory bodies may in the future increase regulation for these electronic systems 

to the extent the laws change some or all of our vehicles may not comply with applicable international federal state or local laws which would have an adverse effect on our business compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome time consuming and expensive to the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive our business prospects financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 

we retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws 

we use our vehicles’ electronic systems to log information about each vehicle’s use in order to aid us in vehicle diagnostics repair and maintenance as well as to help us collect data regarding our customers’ charge time battery usage mileage and efficiency habits our customers may object to the use of this data which may harm our business possession and use of our customers’ personal information in conducting our business may subject us to legislative and regulatory burdens in the united states and foreign jurisdictions that could require notification of data breach restrict our use of such personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers for example we are subject to local data protection laws in europe we may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy consumer protection and security standards and protocols imposed by law regulation industry standards or contractual obligations if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers we may be required to expend significant resources to 

  

resolve these problems a major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand 

our vehicles make use of lithiumion battery cells which on rare occasions have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame 

the battery pack in the tesla roadster makes use of lithiumion cells which have been used for years in laptops and cell phones we also currently intend to make use of lithiumion cells in the battery pack for the model s and any future vehicles we may produce on rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells the events have also raised questions about the suitability of these lithiumion cells for automotive applications to address these questions and concerns a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithiumion battery cell chemistries to improve safety we have designed our battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells and we are not aware of any such incident in our customers’ vehicles we have tested the batteries and subjected them to damaging treatments such as baking overcharging crushing or puncturing to assess our battery pack’s response to deliberate and sometimes destructive abuse however we have delivered only a limited number of tesla roadsters to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles accordingly there can be no assurance that a field failure of our battery packs will not occur which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits in addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our manufacturing facility any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities while we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall moreover any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to the tesla roadster may cause indirect adverse publicity for us such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims 

we may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition the automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles a successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results we maintain product liability insurance for all our vehicles with annual limits of approximately 21 million on a claimsmade basis but we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient to cover all potential product liability claims any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage or outside of our coverage may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and financial condition we may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy 

in connection with the development and sale of our planned model s we will need to comply with various additional safety regulations and requirements that were not applicable to the sales of our tesla roadsters with which it may be expensive or difficult to comply for example we will need to pass certain frontal impact tests 

  

for the model s which are required for sales exceeding certain annual volumes outside the united states we performed such a test on the tesla roadster based on european union testing standards in connection with sales exceeding certain volume thresholds in australia and japan and two criteria were not met in the test we may experience difficulties in meeting all the criteria for this test or similar tests for our planned model s which may delay our ability to sell the model s in high volumes in certain jurisdictions 

we may be compelled to undertake product recalls 

any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition we previously experienced product recalls in may 2009 and october 2010 both of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain in april 2009 we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadsters as a result of a missed process during manufacture of the tesla roadster glider in october 2010 we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle the cost of fixing this most recent recall is not material in the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our vehicles or electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards such recalls voluntary or involuntary involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources which would adversely affect our brand image in our target markets and could adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

our warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected we provide a three year or 36000 miles new vehicle limited warranty with every tesla roadster which we extended to four years or 50000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 tesla roadster in addition customers have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36000 miles whichever comes first the new vehicle limited warranty is similar to other vehicle manufacturers’ warranty programs and is intended to cover all parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body chassis suspension interior electronic systems battery powertrain and brake system we record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs however because we only began delivering our first tesla roadster in early 2008 we have extremely limited operating experience with our vehicles and therefore little experience with warranty claims for these vehicles or with estimating warranty reserves since we began initiating sales of our vehicles we have continued to increase our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim experience and we may be required to undertake further such increases in the future as of december 31 2010 we had warranty reserves of 54 million we could in the future become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense there can be no assurances that our existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction 

we may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs 

companies organizations or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop or sell our vehicles or components which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business from time to time we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks inquiring whether we infringe their proprietary rights companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights relating to battery packs electric motors or 

  

electronic power management systems may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise asserting their rights and seeking licenses in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights we may be required to do one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

 in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we also license patents and other intellectual property from third parties and we may face claims that our use of this inlicensed technology infringes the rights of others in that case we may seek indemnification from our licensors under our license contracts with them however our rights to indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses depending on our use of the technology whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation and other factors 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results our success depends at least in part on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of patents patent applications trade secrets including knowhow employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws trademarks intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology we have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles 

the protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities however such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 existing trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 

  

our patent applications may not result in issued patents which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours 

we cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions nor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor in addition patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws rules and procedures that differ from those of the united states and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued us patents will be issued furthermore if these patent applications issue some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the united states 

the status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain as a result we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will result in patents being issued or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the near future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology in addition patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

three of our trademark applications in the european union remain subject to six outstanding opposition proceedings 

we currently sell and market our vehicles in the european union under the tesla trademark we have three trademark applications in the european union for the tesla trademark these are subject to an outstanding opposition proceeding brought by a prior owner of trademarks consisting of the word tesla if we cannot resolve these remaining oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in the european union this will reduce our ability to challenge third party users of the tesla trademark and dilute the value of the mark as our exclusive brand name in the european union in addition there is a risk that the remaining prior rights owner could in the future take action to challenge our use of the tesla mark in the european union this would have a severe impact on our position in the european union and may inhibit our ability to use the tesla mark in the european union if we were prevented from using the tesla trademark in the european union we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets 

we may be subject to claims arising from an airplane crash in which three of our employees died 

in february 2010 three of our employees died in a crash of an airplane owned and piloted by one of our employees the plane crashed in a neighborhood in east palo alto california the plane also clipped an electrical tower causing a power loss and business interruption in parts of palo alto including stanford university the cause of the accident is under investigation by the national transportation safety board 

in november 2010 a case was filed against us relating to the crash in california superior court in that case plaintiffs allege claims for negligence negligent infliction of emotional distress trespass and violations of federal and state aviation laws and regulations against all defendants and seek compensation for real property damage and loss of use as well as personal property and emotional distressbodily injury claims in december 2010 the plaintiffs settled claims for real property damage but retained her claims for emotional distress bodily injury and personal property damage we believe that these remaining claims are covered by insurance 

as a result of the accident other claims including but not limited to those arising from loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or damage to the electrical tower and surrounding area may be asserted against various parties including us the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims and for any judgments if such claims are adversely determined 

  

our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events 

our corporate headquarters and planned manufacturing facilities are located in california a region known for seismic activity if major disasters such as earthquakes fires floods hurricanes wars terrorist attacks computer viruses pandemics or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products in addition our lease for our palo alto facility permits the landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain thresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts we may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

in the past material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have been identified if we fail to remediate any material weaknesses and maintain proper and effective internal controls our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended and as of december 31 2007 our independent registered public accounting firm identified two control deficiencies that represented material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended and as of december 31 2007 in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 our independent registered public accounting firm did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended and as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 our failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and stock price a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 which resulted in audit adjustments were as follows 

 

  

 we have taken steps to remediate our material weaknesses however there are no assurances that the measures we have taken to remediate these internal control weaknesses were completely effective or that similar weaknesses will not recur our remediation efforts for the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in 2007 have included 

 

  

  

   

additionally as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our financial accounting organization and processes we have hired several senior accounting personnel in the united states we plan to continue to assess our internal controls and procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters we identify 

because of these material weaknesses there is heightened risk that a material misstatement of our financial statements relating to the years ended and as of december 31 2007 was not prevented or detected while no material weaknesses were identified during the course of our audit for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we cannot assure you that these or other similar issues will not arise in future periods 

to date the audit of our consolidated financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm has included a consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis of designing their audit procedures but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting if such an evaluation had been performed or when we are required to perform such an evaluation additional material weaknesses and other control deficiencies may have been or may be identified ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to help produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that needs to be evaluated frequently we will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies relating to internal controls which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

if our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity 

our core values which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity are an important component of our brand image which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices we do not control our independent suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices such as environmental responsibility fair wage practices and compliance with child labor laws among others a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations 

violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand this could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if as a result of such violation we were to attract negative publicity if we or other manufacturers in our industry encounter similar problems in the future it could harm our brand image business prospects financial condition and operating results 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

we will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies which could adversely affect our operating results 

as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements these requirements include compliance with section 404 and other provisions of the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission sec and the nasdaq stock market in addition our management team will also have to adapt to the requirements of being a public company we expect complying with these rules and regulations will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly 

  

the increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services additionally if these requirements divert our management’s attention from other business concerns they could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

as a public company we also expect that it may be more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers 

concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 

as of december 31 2010 our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 547 of our outstanding shares of common stock in particular elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owned approximately 291 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december 31 2010 as a result these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 

we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting we may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and as a result the value of our common stock 

we will be required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ending december 31 2011 this assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

we are in the early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with section 404 we may not be able to remediate future material weaknesses or to complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion during the evaluation and testing process if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 

our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on june 29 2010 and therefore the trading history for our common stock has been limited in addition the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control for example after opening at 1700 per share at the ipo our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 3642 per share and a low of 1498 per share through february 28 2011 

  

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance these fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock during the period following our ipo in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies this litigation if instituted against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

a substantial majority of our total outstanding shares are held by insiders and may be sold on a stock exchange in the near future the large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock 

stockholders owning an aggregate of approximately 75000000 shares are entitled under contracts providing for registration rights to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the united states subject to the restrictions of rule 144 

in addition as of december 31 2010 we have registered approximately 24879437 shares previously issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and agreements of which 13804788 were related to outstanding option awards subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and in certain cases lockup agreements the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the united states in the open market 

sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate these sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

our current agreements with blackstar an affiliate of daimler contain certain restrictions that decrease the likelihood that potential acquirors would make a bid to acquire us 

our financing agreements with blackstar an affiliate of daimler include certain restrictions that decrease the likelihood that potential acquirors would make a bid to acquire us including giving blackstar a right of notice on any acquisition proposal we receive for which we determine to engage in further discussions with a potential acquiror or otherwise pursue blackstar then has a right within a specified time period to submit a competing acquisition proposal in addition elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman and largest stockholder has agreed that he will not transfer any shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by him to any automobile original equipment manufacturer other than daimler without blackstar’s consent mr musk has further agreed not to vote any shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by him in favor of a deemed liquidation transaction to which any automobile original equipment manufacturer other than daimler is a party without blackstar’s consent these provisions could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control of us which could cause our stock price or trading volume to fall 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us our business or our market or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us our business our market or our competitors if any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors our stock price would likely decline if any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 

we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future consequently investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock

our corporate headquarters and powertrain production operations are based in palo alto california we have a lease with stanford university for 350000 square feet which expires in january 2016 and houses our headquarters and powertrain activities the palo alto facility serves as our production facility for the electric vehicle components we utilize in the tesla roadster and for our powertrain component and systems development and sales 

in may 2010 we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility located in fremont california from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi which is a joint venture between toyota and motors liquidation company the owner of selected assets of general motors in october 2010 we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land the total cash paid was 420 million the purchase totals 210 acres or approximately 55 of the land at the site and includes all of the manufacturing facilities located thereon totaling approximately 54 million square feet we intend to use the facility and manufacturing assets for the production of our planned model s vehicle and to build our future vehicles we are currently in an early stage of planning and building out this facility we are required to comply with environmental regulations in connection with our planned model s manufacturing facility in fremont california in october 2010 we and nummi amended the may 2010 purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits or emission credits for additional consideration of 65 million we completed the transfer of these permits in october 2010 

outside of our fremont california facility we do not currently own any of our facilities the following table sets forth the location approximate size and primary use of our significant leased facilities 

 

  

 we anticipate that the build out of both our palo alto facility and our planned model s manufacturing facility in fremont california will be partially financed by our doe loan facility 

we currently intend to add new facilities or expand our existing facilities as we add employees and expand our production organization we believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate our foreseeable future expansion

overview and 2010 highlights 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we own our sales and service network and market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers via the phone and internet inperson at our corporate events and through our network of tesla stores we were incorporated in delaware in 2003 opened our first store in los angeles california in may 2008 and introduced our first vehicle the tesla roadster in early 2008 in july 2009 we introduced a new roadster model the tesla roadster 2 and its higher performance option package roadster sport as well as launched the tesla roadster in europe on july 1 2010 we introduced the roadster 25 with new styling and an upgraded interior 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we experienced solid performance from sales of the tesla roadster especially considering that the automotive sales recognized in 2009 were driven primarily from the fulfillment of a significant reservations list that had accumulated prior to and through 2009 our automotive sales revenues in 2010 were primarily driven by retail store expansion globally and higher sales and marketing activities higher average selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher average selling prices outside of the united states during 2010 we continued to expand our presence in europe and introduced the tesla roadster in canada and in asia our network of stores increased to 16 stores by the end of 2010 and as of december 31 2010 we had sold over 1500 tesla roadsters to customers in 31 countries with sales volume being concentrated in the united states and in europe 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster and during the latter half of 2010 we began offering a leasing alternative in canada under our program we permit qualifying customers to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the term of the individual leases lease revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were 08 million and are recorded as part of our automotive sales revenue approximately 14 of the tesla roadsters delivered during 2010 were under operating leases 

we continued to expand our electric powertrain component and development activities with other automotive manufacturers by the end of 2009 we had completed the development of a battery pack and charger for daimler ag’s daimler smart fortwo electric drive and were selected by daimler to supply it initially with 

  

up to 1000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo electric drive in at least five european cities in 2010 we made significant deliveries of the smart fortwo battery packs and chargers to daimler which contributed approximately 21 million to our automotive sales revenue since 2009 daimler has increased its orders under this program with the current total order at 1800 battery packs and chargers production of the battery packs and chargers is expected to continue through mid2011 during the year daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 a formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with daimler in may 2010 and upon completion of the aclass battery pack and charger in october we started recognizing revenue from the delivery of production battery packs and chargers for the daimler aclass program which we expect to continue through the balance of 2011 

in may 2010 we and toyota motor corporation toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles and for us to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the model s in july 2010 we and toyota entered into an early phase 0 agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with an aim by toyota to market the electric vehicle in the united states in 2012 prototypes would be made by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain we began developing and delivering prototypes to toyota for evaluation during the latter half of the year in connection with this program in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to our agreements toyota will pay us up to 69 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance we expect to achieve our deliverables through late 2011 or early 2012 

as a result of solid sales of the tesla roadster as well as increased powertrain component sales and the commencement of development services revenues from both daimler and toyota total revenues for 2010 were 1167 million an increase over total revenues of 1119 million in 2009 

we are designing our second vehicle the planned model s for a significantly broader customer base than the tesla roadster and plan to manufacture the model s in higher volumes than our current volumes for the tesla roadster model s development progressed well during 2010 culminating in the completion of our first drivable alpha prototype in december expenses related to the model s alpha prototype build increased production and engineering headcount and other important engineering design and testing work being undertaken at several of our suppliers to support model s readiness contributed to the 737 million increase in research and development expenses from 2009 to 930 million in 2010 

alongside model s engineering and manufacturing engineering development we also completed the purchase of our fremont manufacturing facility in october which we intend to use for the production of our planned model s and future vehicles in may 2010 we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility in fremont california from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi which is a joint venture between toyota and motors liquidation company the owner of selected assets of general motors in october 2010 we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land the purchase totals 210 acres or approximately 55 of the land at the site and includes all of the manufacturing facilities located thereon in october 2010 we and nummi amended the facility purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits for additional consideration the aggregate purchase price that we paid to nummi was 485 million including the operating permits 

in august 2010 we entered into an additional purchase agreement with nummi for the purchase of certain manufacturing equipment and spare parts located at the fremont facility this purchase agreement was subsequently amended to include additional manufacturing equipment and spare parts and in october 2010 we completed this purchase concurrent with the completion of the facility purchase the aggregate purchase price that we paid for these assets was 167 million the purchase of the fremont manufacturing facility and assets 

  

along with other model s related investments and investments that we made at our palo alto california corporate headquarters and powertrain facility brought our capital expenditures up to 1054 million in 2010 from 119 million for 2009 

we completed several significant financing transactions in 2010 to help progress our model s and powertrain development activities as well as support our capital investments in manufacturing infrastructure 

 

  

  

 management opportunities challenges and risks—2011 outlook 

our focus for 2011 continues to be on the disciplined development and preparation for the launch of the planned model s in mid2012 as well as the continued growth of revenues through sales of the tesla roadster and our powertrain sales and development activities with our strategic partners 

we expect sales of the tesla roadster to grow over 2010 but expect some seasonality during the winter months we have a supply agreement with lotus to purchase a minimum of 2400 tesla roadster vehicles or gliders through december 31 2010 we have delivered over 1500 vehicles we currently intend to manufacture the majority of our gliders with lotus for our current generation tesla roadster until january 2012 and we intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the tesla roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted accordingly we intend to offer a limited number of tesla roadsters for sale in 2012 to the extent we wish to sell additional tesla roadsters with the lotus gliders beyond the number of vehicles we have contracted for we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with lotus but may be unable to do so on terms and conditions favorable to us if at all we do not currently plan to begin selling our next generation tesla roadster until at least one year after the launch of the model s and we intend to perform such manufacturing entirely in our own facilities continued difficult economic conditions competition from third parties and the planned availability of the model s in 2012 could result in depressed sales of the tesla roadster in 2011 we expect to continue to experience seasonality for sales of the tesla roadster we also anticipate that we will place greater sales emphasis on the generation of model s reservations during the second half of 2011 as we work towards the launch of our planned model s in mid2012 

as a result of our expanded electric powertrain supply and development services activities with our strategic partners in 2010 we will have significant deliveries and milestones to achieve in 2011 along with the supply of battery packs and chargers for daimler’s smart fortwo ev and aclass programs we will also have important development milestones and prototypes to deliver to toyota as part of our toyota rav4 agreements although our current agreements with daimler and toyota provide us with increased revenue potential in 2011 from powertrainrelated activities we do not yet have finalized any agreements with daimler or toyota for significant sales or services beyond 2011 

  

model s development will continue to be a primary focus for 2011 ensuring that our engineering operations and manufacturing engineering teams execute on all significant activities will be critical to a timely launch of our model s in mid2012 our progress towards our beta prototype activities as well as readiness of our manufacturing capabilities will influence our ability to achieve the manufacturing cost per unit that we are currently projecting 

in 2011 we publicly announced the tesla model x as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform we are designing the model x as a crossover vehicle we intend to develop a prototype of the model x by the end of 2011 the acceleration of the development of future vehicles including the tesla model x may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

our operating expenses are expected to increase in 2011 as we continue to execute on the model s program systematically and strategically expand our sales and marketing activities globally to support the launch of the model s as well as to maintain and support the overall activities of a growing public company as we continue to make significant investments in research and development and our infrastructure to launch the model s we expect to continue generating a net loss despite anticipated growth in revenues and improvements in margin cost control within our operations especially in general and administrative continues to be an important objective 

capital spending for the model s program is anticipated to be at its highest level in 2011 as we plan to purchase much of the tooling and manufacturing equipment required for production inclusive of nonmodel s related investments aggregate capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be in the range of 190 million to 215 million the majority of these capital investments should be reimbursable under the terms of our doe loan facility with this level of capital spending we can execute on our strategic decision to increase insourcing primarily in stampings and plastics we have also elected to invest incrementally in new technologies primarily in our paint and body shops to produce vehicles at a higher quality at an affordable cost 

furthermore we are investing in additional plant automation which provides us with the flexibility to expand capacity to produce up to 20000 units on just one shift this investment would have a relatively short payback in terms of saved labor and overhead costs additionally plant automation will allow us to accommodate either higher model s production or the efficient introduction of future models as significant capital investment is required to bring our fremont facility and model s manufacturing assets to a state of production readiness all depreciation of our capital expenditures related to the fremont facility will begin with the start of model s production 

unadjusted error in 2009 

in june 2010 we identified an error related to the understatement in stockbased compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we granted certain stock options for which a portion of the grant was immediately vested we erroneously accounted for the expense on a straightline basis over the term of the award while expense recognition should always be at least commensurate with the number of awards vesting during the period as a result selling general and administrative expenses and net loss for the year ended december 31 2009 were understated by 27 million the error did not have an effect on the valuation of the stock options as stockbased compensation expense is a noncash item there was no impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 

to correct this error we recorded additional stockbased compensation of 24 million during the three months ended june 30 2010 we considered the impact of the error on reported operating expenses and trends in 

  

operating results and determined that the impact of the error was not material to previously reported financial information as well as those related to the three months ended june 30 2010 we also evaluated this control deficiency in the context of our internal control over financial reporting and based on the magnitude nature and extent of the error determined that such deficiency would be considered a significant deficiency a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for the oversight of the company’s financial reporting 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

automotive sales 

we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of the tesla roadster including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle or zev credits we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components such as battery packs and battery chargers to other manufacturers we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sale of vehicles sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets prior to february 2010 we did not provide direct financing for the purchase of the tesla roadster although a thirdparty lender has provided financing arrangements to our customers in the united states under these arrangements we have been paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase starting in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states 

automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle options accessories and destination charges while these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale they are often part of one vehicle sale agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a standalone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items further we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items determined by reference to standalone sales of such items 

  

to date we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles vehicle accessories and options separately outside of any multiple element arrangements as each of these items has stand alone value to the customer revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

development services 

revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from the development of electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs and chargers to meet a customer’s specifications beginning in the quarter ended march 31 2010 we started entering into such contracts with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenuegenerating activity revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured where development arrangements include substantive atrisk milestones revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractuallydefined milestones amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2010 we had deferred 40 million in revenue related to development services being performed for toyota increased complexity to our development agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

costs of development services are expensed as incurred costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses once an agreement is finalized these costs are recorded in cost of development services 

prior to 2010 compensation from the smart fortwo development arrangement with daimler which is discussed below under “development compensation” was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 

development compensation 

we began receiving payments under the smart fortwo development arrangement with daimler in the year ended december 31 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities we deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time upon entering into the final agreement in may 2009 we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses on a straightline basis this amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement beginning in may 2009 and continuing through november 2009 payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in may 2009 were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones all amounts received under this development agreement have been recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations all development activities under this agreement were completed as of december 31 2009 

inventory valuation 

we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for estimated 

  

obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 

once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we recorded writedowns of 10 million and 14 million in cost of automotive sales respectively during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded writedowns of 37 million to research and development expenses and 06 million to cost of automotive sales 

the inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand selling prices and production costs should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change material changes to these reserves may be required further a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or powertrain component is delivered to a customer warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations and we will adjust our estimates as needed initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly the adjustments that we record may be material as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had 54 million and 38 million in warranty reserves respectively adjustments to warranty reserves are recorded in cost of automotive sales 

it is likely that as we sell additional tesla roadsters and powertrain components we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments further a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

valuation of stockbased awards common stock and warrants 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options granted to employees which requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award the fair value of the awards is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four years stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of forfeitures 

the fair value of each new employee option awarded was estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the blackscholes optionpricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions 

 

   

if in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

the riskfree interest rate that we use is based on the united states treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life given our limited history with employee grants we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants the “simplified” method as permitted by the sec is calculated as the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the options 

our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business including the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries because we have no trading history on our common stock when making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation we also considered the stage of development size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies our historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee option data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of sales research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

we account for stock options issued to nonemployees also based on their estimated fair value determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model however the fair value of the equity awards granted to nonemployees is remeasured as the awards vest and the resulting increase in value if any is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 

common stock valuation 

upon the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 our common stock has been valued by reference to its publicly traded price prior to the ipo we historically granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock as determined at the date of grant by our board of directors because there has been no public market for our common stock our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including the following 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we had made different assumptions than those used the amount of our stockbased compensation expense net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different the following table summarizes by grant date the number of stock options granted since january 1 2008 through the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 and the associated per share exercise price which equaled the fair value of our common stock for each of these grants 

 

 included in the december 4 2009 awards were 6711972 stock options granted to our chief executive officer comprised of two grants in recognition of his and our company’s achievements and to create incentives for future success the board of directors approved an option grant representing 4 of our fullydiluted share base prior to such grant as of december 4 2009 or 3355986 stock options with 14th of the shares vesting immediately and 136th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest each month over three years assuming continued employment through each vesting date in addition to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan—the successful launch and commercialization of the model s—the board of directors approved additional options totaling an additional 4 of our fullydiluted shares prior to such grant as of december 4 2009 with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance objectives as follows assuming mr musk’s continued service to us through each vesting date 

 

  

  

  

   

if mr musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the grant 

included in our june and september 2010 stock option grants were 666300 and 20000 stock options granted respectively to various members of our senior management with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the same performance objectives as those outlined for mr musk above 

prior to our ipo which was completed on july 2 2010 our board of directors performed valuations of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid valuation of privatelyheldcompany equity securities issued as compensation  the enterprise value input of our common stock valuations were derived either using fundamental analysis income and market approaches or based on a recent round of financing option pricing approach the income approach estimates the enterprise value of the company by discounting the expected future cash flows of the company to present value we have applied discount rates that reflect the risks associated with our cash flow projections and have used venture capital rates of return for companies at a similar stage of development as us as a proxy for our cost of capital our discounted cash flow calculations are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make at each valuation date relating to appropriate discount rates for various components of our business for example the discount rates used to value the cash flow projections from the model s business factored in the low cost debt we expected to raise from the us department of energy 

 

 our projected cash flows have been primarily derived from our tesla roadster model s and powertrain revenue streams in more recent valuations these cash flow projections take into account the fact that we have been selling the tesla roadster since 2008 that we began selling powertrain components in the quarter ended december 31 2009 and our anticipation of model s production in mid2012 

under the market approach the total enterprise value of the company is estimated by comparing our business to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in public markets or businesses that are involved in a public or private transaction prior transactions in our stock are also considered as part of the market approach methodology we have selected revenue valuation multiples derived from trading multiples of public companies that participate in the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries these valuation multiples were then applied to the equivalent financial metric of our business giving consideration to differences between our company and similar companies for such factors as company size and growth prospects 

for those reports that relied on the fundamental analysis we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the enterprise value for both the market approach and the income approach the financial forecasts took into account our past experience and future expectations the risks associated with achieving these forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate as discussed below there is inherent 

  

uncertainty in these estimates second we allocated the resulting equity value among the securities that comprise our capital structure using the optionpricing method the aggregate value of the common stock derived from the optionpricing method was then divided by the number of common shares outstanding to arrive at the per common share value for those reports before our ipo that relied on the recent round of financing we backsolved for the total equity value such that the value of the instrument sold in the recent round as calculated by the option pricing model was consistent with the observed transaction price 

our board of directors considered the valuations derived from the approaches above the probability and timing of completing an ipo as of those dates as well as other qualitative factors in arriving at our common stock valuations including the following 

 

  

  

  

 valuations that we have performed require significant use of estimates and assumptions if different estimates and assumptions had been used our common stock valuations could be significantly different and related stockbased compensation expense may be materially impacted 

warrants 

we have accounted for our freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities at fair value upon issuance we have recorded the warrants as a liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock are contingently redeemable and therefore may obligate us to transfer assets at some point in the future the warrants are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations 

in january 2010 we issued a warrant to the doe in connection with the closing of the doe loan facility to purchase shares of our series e convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of 251 per share this convertible preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 754 per share upon the closing of our ipo in july 2010 beginning on december 15 2018 and until december 14 2022 the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the doe loan facility during the prior quarter the warrant may be exercised until december 15 2023 if we prepay the doe loan facility in part or in full the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense net until its expiration or vesting our ability to prepay the doe loan facility and consequently the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrant was determined to represent an embedded derivative this embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant 

since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrants will vary depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates we measured the fair value of the doe warrant using a monte carlo simulation approach the monte carlo approach simulates various scenarios and captures the optimal decisions to be made between prepaying the doe loan and the cancellation of the doe warrant over the expected term of the doe loan facility of 13 years for the purposes of the simulation the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us the total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation date 

  

the significant assumptions that we use in the valuation of the doe warrant include similar assumptions used in the valuation of otherwise featureless stock warrants at various simulated stock prices as well as the interest rate differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates for companies comparable to us the estimated value of our stock warrant requires us to use a blackscholes optionpricing model which incorporates several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stockbased compensation discussed above the differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates is derived from the credit spread data of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business as the average simulated value of our stock warrant increases relative to the credit spread of our comparator companies the fair value of our doe warrant decreases since the economic cost of prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt would be lower than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants similarly as the credit spread of our comparator companies increases relative to the average simulated value of our stock warrant the fair value of our doe warrant increases since the economic cost associated with prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt is higher than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants and therefore we would not prepay our outstanding doe debt and we would allow a higher number of warrants to vest prior to completion of our ipo the fair value of the doe warrant was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet upon the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 this warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from convertible preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability the doe warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in other expense net as the number of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or vesting as of december 31 2010 the fair value of the doe warrant was 61 million the relative movements in our stock price as compared to the credit spread of our comparator companies will result in fair value changes being recorded in other expense net in future periods which may be significant 

excluding the warrant issued to the doe in january 2010 we have estimated the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a blackscholes optionpricing model which used several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stockbased compensation as discussed above upon the completion of our ipo in july 2010 these convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding as of june 30 2010 were net exercised and the related convertible preferred stock warrant liability was settled 

income taxes 

we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans as of december 31 2010 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

  

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes such as net operating losses based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update which requires companies to allocate revenue in multipleelement arrangements based on an element’s estimated selling price if vendorspecific or other thirdparty evidence of value is not available the guidance is effective beginning january 1 2011 with early application permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level i and level ii fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers in addition in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using level iii inputs a reporting entity will be required to disclose information about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross rather than on a net basis the updated guidance will also require fair value disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring level ii and level iii fair value measurements the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the disclosures regarding the reconciliation of level iii fair value measurements which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard update which provides guidance on the criteria to be followed in recognizing revenue under the milestone method the milestone method of recognition allows a vendor who is involved with the provision of deliverables to recognize the full amount of a milestone payment upon achievement if at the inception of the revenue arrangement the milestone is determined to be substantive as defined in the standard the guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 early adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 

 

 revenues 

automotive sales 

automotive sales consisted of the following for the periods presented 

 

 automotive sales during the year ended december 31 2010 were 971 million a decrease from 1119 million during the year ended december 31 2009 automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2010 consisted of 755 million of vehicle options and related sales and 216 million of powertrain component and related sales compared to 1116 million of vehicle options and related sales and 04 million of powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2009 automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2008 were 147 million comprised primarily of sales of the tesla roadster which we began to deliver in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as related zero emission vehicle or zev credits almost all of the revenue recognized during the year ended december 31 2008 came from fulfilling reservations placed in prior periods 

  

during the first three quarters of 2009 we continued to fulfill reservations for the tesla roadster and we had made a significant effort to increase our production capacity in order to accelerate deliveries to customers who had been on our waitlist for a significant amount of time as a result a significant portion of the revenue recognized during the first three quarters of 2009 came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009 beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009 sales of the tesla roadster began more closely approximating the level of orders placed during the quarter consequently the comparison of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 versus the year ended december 31 2009 may not be meaningful as such vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were more reflective of current demand as compared to the prior year similarly zev credit sales which are included in vehicle options and related sales were higher during the year ended december 31 2009 as the fulfillment of a significant number of reservations allowed us to sell a larger number of zev credits the year over year decrease in vehicle deliveries was partially offset by higher selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher average selling prices outside of the united states 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary tesla motors leasing inc qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the term of the individual leases lease revenues are recorded in vehicle options and related sales within automotive sales revenue and for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized 08 million during the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 14 of the vehicles delivered during the year were under operating leases as of december 31 2010 we had deferred revenues of 11 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases 

powertrain component and related sales were comprised primarily of battery packs and chargers that we delivered to supply daimler’s smart fortwo program we have been selected by daimler to supply it with up to 1800 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo electric drive in at least five european cities we began delivering and recognizing revenue for these production battery packs and chargers at the end of 2009 

prior to 2010 most of our revenues had been generated through sales of our vehicles in the united states and we had no revenues from sales outside of the united states prior to the third quarter of 2009 our international sales commenced with the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july 2009 and since then we have recognized revenue from sales of the tesla roadster in additional countries including canada japan and hong kong for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 55 and 19 of our revenue from vehicle options and related sales respectively were derived outside of the united states all of our powertrain component and related sales were derived outside of the united states as we continue to expand into additional new markets we expect our international automotive sales to increase in aggregate dollar amounts but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenues 

while revenue related to servicing vehicles has been insignificant to date we expect such revenues to increase in future periods as we sell more vehicles and as vehicle warranties begin to expire 

development services 

beginning in the first quarter of 2010 we started entering into development services arrangements with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenuegenerating activity we began recognizing development services revenue during the first quarter of 2010 with the development and delivery of modular battery packs for freightliner custom chassis corporation or freightliner an affiliate of daimler these battery packs were to be used in electric delivery vans in a limited number of freightliner’s customer trials prior to 2010 compensation that we had received from our first development arrangement with daimler 

  

for battery packs and chargers for its smart fortwo program was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 

during the first quarter of 2010 daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 we began providing development services for this program during the first quarter of 2010 and had received an aggregate of 55 million in payments however as we had not executed a final agreement related to this program as of march 31 2010 we deferred the 55 million of payments that had been received from daimler to that point in may 2010 we executed a final agreement under which daimler would make additional payments to us for the successful completion of certain development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples as of december 31 2010 we had completed our deliverables under this agreement and for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized 144 million in development services revenue 

in july 2010 we and toyota entered into a phase 0 agreement to initiate development of an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 under this early phase development agreement prototypes would be made by us by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain during the year ended december 31 2010 we began producing and delivering prototypes to toyota and recognized 10 million in development services revenue 

in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to this agreement toyota will pay us up to 600 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance including a 50 million upfront payment that we received upon the execution of the agreement during the year ended december 31 2010 we completed the first milestone and along with the amortization of our upfront payment we recognized 33 million in development services revenue 

we intend to grow our development services revenue over time by establishing additional commercial arrangements with daimler toyota and other automobile manufacturers additionally we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 was 860 million a decrease from 1024 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the decrease in cost of revenues was driven primarily by the significant number of vehicles delivered during the first three quarters of 2009 from fulfilling customer reservations placed prior to 2009 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary tesla motors leasing inc qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly we record cost of automotive sales equal to the depreciation of the leased vehicles on a straightline basis over the term of the individual leases cost of automotive sales related to leased vehicles was 04 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

the decrease in cost of revenues from automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2010 was partially offset by the increase in cost of revenues from development services cost of development services includes 

  

engineering support and testing direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements during the quarter ended march 31 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 as of march 31 2010 a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such the related development services costs of 05 million that we incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2010 were expensed in research and development in may 2010 we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs related to this program in cost of revenues 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 was 307 million an increase from 95 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was driven primarily by the gross profit contributed by our development services revenues which we began to recognize in 2010 an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers the continued launch of the tesla roadster internationally where in certain markets we have experienced higher selling prices and cost improvements associated with the model changeover from the tesla roadster to the tesla roadster 2 during the second half of 2009 gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 was also favorably impacted by the fact that certain of the aclass development services revenue that we recognized during the year ended december 31 2010 did not have any corresponding cost of revenues since these costs were recorded in research and development expenses prior to us finalizing the development agreement in may 2010 

cost of revenues of 1024 million for the year ended december 31 2009 increased from 159 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the significant increase in cost of revenues was due to the increase in tesla roadster sales from which we began to recognize revenue during the fourth quarter of 2008 higher warranty expense and the model changeover from the tesla roadster to the tesla roadster 2 as well as significant part changes implemented to improve the design and reduce per unit costs for which we recorded charges to cost of revenues in the amount of 14 million for excess and obsolete inventory during the year ended december 31 2009 

gross loss for the year ended december 31 2008 was 11 million due to the lower average selling prices for our initial vehicles the high materials and manufacturing costs associated with our first generation tesla roadster and limited economies of scale from low vehicle production volumes gross profit for the year ended december 31 2009 of 95 million benefited from higher per unit revenue and reduced manufacturing cost from increased volume and component redesign 

we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria this may cause our gross profit and gross margin to be similarly impacted 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense also included in research and development expenses are development services costs that we incur if any prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 

research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 930 million an increase from 193 million for the year ended december 31 2009 research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 included 232 million in daimler smart fortwo development compensation which was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses the 737 million increase in research and 

  

development expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 consisted primarily of a 250 million increase in employee cash and stockbased compensation expenses primarily associated with significantly higher headcount to support our model s and powertrain development activities the 232 million daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 a 105 million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s alpha build as well as powertrain development activities a 107 million increase in professional and outside services costs related to model s engineering design and testing activities and a 16 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business including our transition to our palo alto headquarters 

during the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 as of march 31 2010 a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such the related development services costs of 05 million that we incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2010 were expensed in research and development in may 2010 we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs associated with this program in cost of revenues 

research and development expenses of 193 million for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased from 537 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 344 million decrease in research and development expenses was a result of the 232 million daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 a 133 million decrease resulting from the allocation of various manufacturingrelated costs to inventory and cost of sales once we transitioned into commercial production a 32 million decrease in charges related to excess and obsolescence adverse purchase commitments and materials and tooling expense due both to the classification of productionrelated costs to cost of sales once we transitioned into commercial production as well as lower outside professional services partially offset by a 55 million increase in employee compensation expenses associated with higher headcount for the year ended december 31 2009 

we began receiving payments under the smart fortwo development arrangement with daimler in the year ended december 31 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities we deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time upon entering into the final agreement in may 2009 we began recognizing as an offset to our research and development expenses the deferred development compensation of 145 million on a straightline basis this amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement beginning in may 2009 and continuing through november 2009 payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in may 2009 were recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones we did not recognize any development compensation from daimler during the year ended december 31 2008 

since the commercial launch of the tesla roadster our investment in related research and development has decreased significantly we have however significantly increased our research and development efforts for the model s which has resulted in an increase in our research and development expenses in both aggregate dollar amounts and as a percentage of our revenues we anticipate that this trend will continue on an annual basis as we incur additional costs to develop the model s and to operate our planned model s manufacturing facility in fremont california prior to the start of model s production 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 846 million an increase from 422 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 424 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 consisted primarily of a 158 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards expense related to performancebased awards an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants made in 2010 and the 24 million correction of additional stockbased compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 a 134 million increase in employee cash compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support a larger number of stores in the united states and europe and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 71 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business including the opening of new stores and service locations and our transition to our palo alto headquarters a 32 million increase in travel and expenses related to our sales and marketing activities and a 10 million increase in professional services costs related to ongoing trademark and patent work recruiting as well as general corporate development activities 

selling general and administrative expenses of 422 million for the year ended december 31 2009 increased from 236 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 186 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 consisted primarily of an 84 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support our opening of additional stores in the united states and europe as well as higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business and our efforts to become a public company a 47 million increase in office information technology and facilities costs to support the growth of our business including the opening of new stores a 20 million increase in legal services and legal settlements and accounting and other consulting services to support our growth and a 13 million increase in costs principally related to increased marketing activities 

we expect selling general and administrative expenses to increase both in aggregate dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue in future periods as we continue to grow and expand our operations increase our sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and prepare for the planned model s commercial launch in mid2012 and as we support the requirements of being a public company we also expect an increase in our selling general and administrative expenses as a result of our planned increase in the number of tesla stores as of december 31 2010 we had opened tesla stores in the united states europe and japan we plan to open additional stores during 2011 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was 10 million a decrease from 25 million for the year ended december 31 2009 interest expense during the year ended december 31 2009 was primarily related to our convertible notes which were converted into shares of our series e convertible preferred stock in may 2009 while interest expense during the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to our loans under the doe loan facility which we began accessing in 2010 during the year ended december 31 2010 we capitalized 08 million of interest expense to assets under construction 

interest expense of 25 million for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased from 37 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in interest expense was due to the conversion of our convertible notes into shares of our series e convertible preferred stock in may 2009 

we expect interest expense to increase as we continue to draw down on the doe loan facility to fund our model s and powertrain activities 

  

other expense net 

other expense net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our warrant liabilities and transaction gains and losses on our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates income or charges resulting from the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability excluding the doe warrant liability was eliminated after july 2 2010 as these warrants were net exercised at the completion of our ipo the doe convertible preferred stock warrant which we issued in january 2010 became a common stock warrant on july 2 and is carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value continuing to be reflected in other expense net until its expiration or vesting 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2010 was 66 million an increase in expense compared to other expense net of 14 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to the fair value changes in our warrant liabilities as well as the liability related to common stock warrants to certain of our stockholders which we issued in may 2010 both of which increased significantly in conjunction with the increase in our common stock valuation 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2009 increased from 10 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase was primarily a result of a 18 million increase in foreign currency transaction losses associated with a higher level of foreign currency denominated purchases as well as the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar partially offset by a 16 million decrease in the fair value change of our outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants during the year ended december 31 2009 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2010 was 02 million an increase from the provision for income taxes of 26000 during the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was due primarily to the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july 2009 and the ensuing increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions in subsequent periods additionally during the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized research and development benefits from our foreign operations which decreased our provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased from the provision for income taxes of 01 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was due primarily to the research and development benefits that we recognized in 2009 from our foreign operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2010 we had 5664 million principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility this includes cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 996 million which included investments in money market funds cash of 736 million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility and 3932 million available under the doe loan facility which is primarily intended to cover spending related to the development of the model s and our powertrain activities 

our primary source of cash historically has been proceeds from the sales of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes and through december 31 2009 we had raised an aggregate of 3192 million from convertible preferred stock and convertible note financings during the year ended december 31 2010 we entered into our 4650 million doe loan facility from which we have begun to make draw downs as well as completing our ipo and private placements with toyota and panasonic other sources of cash have also included reservation payments from customers for the tesla roadster and more recently from sales of the tesla roadster 

  

cash from the provision of electric powertrain development services sales of powertrain components draw downs from the doe loan facility and refundable reservation payments for our model s 

we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash cash equivalents cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility together with our anticipated cash from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations through the anticipated initial customer deliveries of the model s this capital will fund our ongoing operations continue research development and design efforts establish sales and service centers improve infrastructure such as expanded battery assembly facilities and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce the model s the acceleration of the development of future vehicles investments in new technologies increased insourcing of manufacturing capabilities investments to expand our powertrain activities or further expand our sales and service network may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit we may also choose to opportunistically raise additional funds if market conditions are favorable we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

doe loan facility 

on january 20 2010 we entered into our doe loan facility for 4650 million to support the expansion of our manufacturing operations up to an aggregate principal amount of 1012 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors and electric components or the powertrain facility up to an aggregate principal amount of 3639 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 915 of the costs eligible for funding for the development of and to build out the manufacturing facility for our model s sedan or the model s facility our obligations for the development of and the buildout of our manufacturing facility for the model s is budgeted to be an aggregate of 33 million or approximately 85 of the ongoing budgeted cost plus any cost overruns for the projects 

our ability to draw down funds under the doe loan facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions we are currently in compliance with these draw conditions for the powertrain facility the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components for the model s facility the remaining draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the model s and the planned model s manufacturing facility certain advances will be subject to additional conditions to drawdown related to the site on which the applicable project is located we are currently progressing towards our milestones additionally the doe loan facility provides for the ability to update milestones should a reasonable need arise loans may be requested under the facilities until january 22 2013 and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date 

through december 31 2010 we had received loans under the doe loan facility for an aggregate of 718 million with interest rates ranging from 17 to 34 in february 2011 we received additional loans under the doe loan facility for 156 million at interest rates ranging from 26 to 30 interest on advances under the doe loan facility is payable quarterly in arrears advances under the powertrain facility are repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments commencing on december 15 2012 or for advances made after such date in 26 equal quarterly installments commencing on june 15 2013 all outstanding amounts under the powertrain facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of september 15 2019 advances under the model s facility are repayable in 40 equal quarterly installments commencing on december 15 2012 or for advances made after such date in 38 equal quarterly installments commencing on june 15 2013 all outstanding amounts under the model s facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of september 15 2022 advances under the loan facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at any time all obligations under the doe loan facility are secured by substantially all of our property

in addition to our obligation to fund a portion of the project costs as described above we have agreed to set aside 50 of the net proceeds from our ipo and the concurrent toyota private placement and any subsequent offerings of stock occurring before the completion of the projects up to an aggregate of 100 million to fund a separate dedicated account under our doe loan facility this dedicated account can be used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and model s manufacturing facility projects and will also be used as a mechanism to defer advances under the doe loan facility this will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the doe loans but will require us to use the dedicated account to fund certain project costs up front which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the doe loan facility once the dedicated account is depleted or as part of the final advance for the applicable project we will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account in an amount equal to up to 30 of the remaining project costs for the applicable project and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the drawdown of additional loans under our doe loan facility once used in full or as part of the final advance for the applicable project upon the completion of our ipo and concurrent private placement on july 2 2010 we transferred 1000 million of the net proceeds from the ipo and the concurrent private placement to fund the dedicated account during third and fourth quarters of 2010 we transferred 264 million from the dedicated account to our operating cash accounts in accordance with the provisions of the doe loan facility as of december 31 2010 736 million remained in the dedicated account as we expect to transfer the remainder of this balance within one year we have recorded such cash as current restricted cash in february 2011 we transferred an additional 156 million from the dedicated account

initial public offering and toyota concurrent private placement 

on june 28 2010 our registration statement on form s1 relating to our ipo was declared effective by the sec the ipo closed on july 2 2010 at which time we sold 11880600 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of 1888 million from this transaction net of underwriting discounts and commissions additionally we incurred offering costs of 44 million related to the ipo

panasonic private placement 

in november 2010 we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with an entity affiliated with panasonic corporation panasonic pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 1418573 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of 300 million 

  

leasing activities 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary tesla motors leasing inc qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value 

when compared to our sales of vehicles our leasing activities will spread the cash inflows that we would otherwise receive upon the sale of a vehicle over the lease term and final disposition of the leased vehicle as such our cash and working capital requirements will be directly impacted and if leasing volume increases significantly the impact may be material however after taking into consideration our current and planned sources of operating cash our ability to monitor and prospectively adjust our leasing activity as well as our intent to collect nonrefundable deposits for leased vehicles that are manufactured to specification we do not believe that our planned leasing operations will materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments and obligations as they become due as we will also be exposed to credit risk related to the timely collection of lease payments from our customers we intend to utilize our credit approval and ongoing review processes in order to minimize any credit losses that could occur and which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we intend to require deposits from customers electing a lease option for vehicles built to a customer’s specifications on the same timeframe and under the same circumstances as from customers purchasing our vehicles outright during the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 14 of the vehicles delivered during the period were under operating leases as of december 31 2010 we had deferred revenues of 11 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases through december 31 2010 our leasing activity has not had a significant adverse impact on our liquidity 

reservation payments 

a source of our cash flows from operations has been through our receipt of reservation payments from our customers reservation payments consist of reservation payments that allow potential customers to hold a reservation for the future purchase of a tesla roadster or model s for our 2010 model year tesla roadsters manufactured to specification our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies based on the country of purchase for the model s we require an initial reservation payment of at least 5000 for vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms no deposit is required prior to the second quarter of 2010 our reservation policy was to accept reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a tesla roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications during the second quarter of 2010 we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for tesla roadsters manufactured to specification at the time a customer enters into a purchase agreement however we also occasionally accept reservation payments for the tesla roadster if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications for customers who have placed a reservation payment with us the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement the full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle is required only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer we do not believe that these changes will materially impact our liquidity or capital resources reservation payments for a vehicle are recorded as a current liability when received no later than upon the delivery of a vehicle the reservation payments collected on a customer’s account are applied against the total purchase price of the vehicle reservation payments are expected to fluctuate as the number of reservation holders on the tesla roadster reservation list decreases while the number of reservation holders on the model s reservation list increases 

  

summary of cash flows 

 

 cash flows from operating activities 

we continue to experience negative cash flows from operations as we expand our business and build our infrastructure both in the united states and internationally since inception we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately 3306 million of cash in operations through december 31 2010 our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory personnel related expenditures accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities 

net cash used in operating activities was 1278 million during the year ended december 31 2010 the largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of 1543 million which included noncash charges of 212 million related to stockbased compensation expense 106 million related to depreciation and amortization and 50 million related to the fair value change in our warrant liabilities significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 1776 million of operating expenses 860 million of cost of revenues a 201 million increase in inventory an 84 million increase in operating lease vehicles and a 50 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a 133 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 35 million increase in other longterm liabilities inventory increased to meet our production requirements for the tesla roadster and powertrain component sales while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business as well as our increased manufacturing and model s development activities operating lease vehicles increased with the introduction of our leasing program in 2010 other longterm liabilities increased as a result of higher warranty liability from sales of the tesla roadster 

significant operating cash inflows for the year ended december 31 2010 were derived primarily from automotive sales of 971 million 197 million of development services revenue a 48 million increase in deferred revenues and a 47 million increase in reservation payments partially offset by a 32 million increase in accounts receivable in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 upon execution of the agreement we received a 50 million upfront payment for which revenue is being recognized over the expected term of our performance deferred revenues also increased from our vehicle leasing activities as we are recognizing the lease downpayments over the term of the operating leases the increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to powertrain component sales in relation to daimler’s smart fortwo program as well as 23 million receivable from toyota for the achievement of the first milestone under the phase 1 contract services agreement during the year ended december 31 2010 we received 104 million of net new reservation payments for the model s while reservation payments for the tesla roadster decreased by 57 million

a 20 million increase in our prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a 34 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 09 million increase in accounts payable inventory increased to meet our production requirements while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets reflect a higher level of annual operating costs such as insurance licenses and taxes from the growth of the business the increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable were also primarily due to the growth in our business 

significant operating cash inflows for the year ended december 31 2009 were derived primarily from the sales of the tesla roadster as well as development compensation related to the daimler development agreement cash inflows related to automotive sales activity were 885 million comprised of 1119 million of automotive sales partially offset by a 220 million decrease in refundable reservation payments and a 15 million decrease in deferred revenues the decrease in the refundable reservation payments was due to the launch of the tesla roadster during the year ended december 31 2008 as we continued to deliver the tesla roadster to our customers in 2009 we applied the related reservation payments to the respective customers’ purchase cost cash inflows from the daimler development agreement were 132 million comprised primarily of 232 million of development compensation partially offset by a 100 million decrease in deferred development compensation the decrease in deferred development compensation was the result of the amortization of deferred development compensation that we received during the year ended december 31 2008

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of december 31 2010 certain significant cash obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands 

 

  

 in october 2010 we completed the purchase of our fremont california manufacturing facility from nummi nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at the fremont site which affect soil and groundwater and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues we cannot determine with certainty the potential costs to remediate any preexisting contamination based on management’s best estimate we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be 53 million which is not reflected in the table above as the timing of any potential payments cannot be reasonably determined at this time as nummi continues with its decommissioning activities and as we continue with our planned construction and operating activities it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially 

we have reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing 

on the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on the remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we held reservation payments of 308 million and 260 million from potential customers respectively which are not reflected in the table above as of december 31 2010 we held reservation payments for undelivered tesla roadsters in an aggregate amount of 25 million and reservation payments for model s sedans in an aggregate amount of 283 million as of december 31 2009 we held reservation payments for undelivered tesla roadsters in an aggregate amount of 82 million and reservation 

  

payments for model s sedans in an aggregate amount of 179 million in order to convert the reservation payments into revenue we will need to sell vehicles to these customers all reservation payments for the model s are fully refundable until such time that a customer enters into a purchase agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency risk 

a portion of our revenues costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were denominated in foreign currencies this is primarily due to the contract with lotus cars limited or lotus in the united kingdom to manufacture the tesla roadster vehicles and gliders and other parts sourced in europe in addition our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses denominated in foreign currencies principally in the british pound the euro and the japanese yen this cost exposure is partially offset by our recent sales growth in these regions since payments for vehicles sold in these regions are denominated in the local currency this provides a partial natural hedge to our cost exposure in europe and asia depending on our sales levels in these regions our battery cell purchases from asian suppliers are also subject to currency risk although our present contracts are united states dollar based if the united states dollar depreciates significantly against the local currency it could cause our asian suppliers to significantly raise their prices which could harm our financial results to date the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been significant 

interest rate risk 

we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 996 million as of december 31 2010 a portion of these amounts were invested in money market funds cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents declines in interest rates however would reduce future investment income 

as of december 31 2010 we have received loans under the doe loan facility for an aggregate of 718 million with interest rates ranging from 17 to 34 as we continue to borrow under our doe loan facility interest rates will be determined by the secretary of the treasury as of the date of each loan based on the treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such loan we also have capital lease obligations of 08 million as of december 31 2010 which are fixed rate instruments and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates
